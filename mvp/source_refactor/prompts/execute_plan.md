## CONTEXT

A plan was developed to refactor a target that suffers from a specific type of code smell. The plan consists of blocks, each of which is formed by a list of refactoring operations. The blocks were designed to perform the refactoring in steps, such that after the execution of each block, it will have a compilable sub-solution with functional tests. For this, both the source code mentioned in the plan and the related tests may need to be rewritten.

## TASK

Apply the staged refactoring block to the provided Java source files.

Preserving behavior does not require preserving the original target-class API when the plan explicitly moves methods or responsibilities to another class.

## CONSTRAINTS

- Modify only files listed in allowed_files field.
- Return the full new content for every modified file.
- Do not return partial patches.
- Do not edit unrelated tests.
- Do not change unrelated code.
- Do not undo previous refactorings.
- If the block cannot be safely applied, return an empty files_to_write list and explain the reason in "notes".
- Return only files that actually changed.
- Do not include unchanged files in files_to_write.
- Implement the refactoring operations requested in the current block. Do not replace the requested refactoring with a more conservative alternative.

## INPUT PLAN

{input}

## OUTPUT

Return ONLY valid JSON in this format:

{
  "files_to_write": [
    {
      "path": "src/main/java/..." or "src/test/java/...",
      "content": "full file content here"
    }
  ],
  "files_to_delete": [],
  "notes": "short explanation"
}
