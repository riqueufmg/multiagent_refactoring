"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.x86 depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly, which is a more stable and abstract package containing core assembly model classes and interfaces. The x86 package implements specific parsers and types for x86 architecture, following the Stable Dependencies Principle by depending on more stable components. There are no dependencies on less stable packages, and the architecture flows from abstract (assembly) to concrete (x86), maintaining stability direction."
