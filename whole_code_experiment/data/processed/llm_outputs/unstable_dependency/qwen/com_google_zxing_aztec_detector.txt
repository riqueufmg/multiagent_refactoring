"package": "com.google.zxing.aztec.detector",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.aztec.detector depends on com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecDetectorResult and several classes in com.google.zxing.common and com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon. These dependencies are more stable as they are foundational classes used across multiple packages in the library. AztecDetectorResult extends DetectorResult, which is a stable base class. The Reed-Solomon classes are also stable utility classes for error correction. The detector package itself contains specialized detection logic, making it less stable than the packages it depends on, thus following the Stable Dependencies Principle."
