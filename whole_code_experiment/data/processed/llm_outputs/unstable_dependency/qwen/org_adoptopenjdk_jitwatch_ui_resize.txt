"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize contains the RateLimitedResizeListener and IRedrawable interface. Classes in other packages (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain) depend on these classes. The resize package itself has no outgoing dependencies to other packages, making it a stable component that other less stable components depend on. This follows the Stable Dependencies Principle, as stable components should be depended upon, not depend on others. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
