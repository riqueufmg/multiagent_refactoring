"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler has outgoing dependencies to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process, but no incoming dependencies from other packages are shown. Since it depends on more stable packages (logger and process) and there are no dependencies from less stable packages, it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
