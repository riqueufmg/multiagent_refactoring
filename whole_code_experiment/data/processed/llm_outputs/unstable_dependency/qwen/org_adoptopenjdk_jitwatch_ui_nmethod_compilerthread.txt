"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod, and incoming dependencies from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main. The stability of the dependent packages (model being more stable/core, ui.nmethod being at the same UI level, and ui.main being a higher-level UI component) follows a logical flow where this package depends on more stable packages (model) and is depended upon by less stable packages (ui.main), which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not indicate an Unstable Dependency smell."
