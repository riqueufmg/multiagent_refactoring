"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.zing has incoming dependencies (used by other packages) but no outgoing dependencies to other packages within the provided code. It only depends on standard Java libraries (java.io, java.util, java.util.regex) and its own internal packages (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util). Since it doesn't depend on any less stable packages and is itself a leaf package in terms of inter-package dependencies, it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
