"package": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.runner",

"justification": "The package net.bytebuddy.benchmark.runner has outgoing dependencies on net.bytebuddy.benchmark and org.openjdk.jmh.runner. The stability of the net.bytebuddy.benchmark package cannot be determined from the provided code, but org.openjdk.jmh.runner is likely a stable external library (JMH - Java Microbenchmark Harness). Since the package depends on what appear to be more stable components (especially the external JMH library), it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not exhibit Unstable Dependency smell."
