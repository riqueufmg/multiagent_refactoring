Class A implements DuplicateTypeName interface and contains an inner class DuplicateTypeName that extends A, creating a stable internal structure. There are no outgoing dependencies to other packages, and the internal dependencies follow a logical hierarchy where the inner class extends the outer class, maintaining stability within the package boundaries."
