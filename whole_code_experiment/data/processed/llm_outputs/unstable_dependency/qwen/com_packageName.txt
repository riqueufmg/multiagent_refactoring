```json
{
"package": "com.packageName",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.packageName contains classes that are only depended upon by other classes (in the default package) but do not depend on any external packages themselves. Specifically, classes like ClassInPackage and InnerStaticClassFieldContainer are used by classes in the default package, but com.packageName does not have any outgoing dependencies to less stable packages. Therefore, it does not exhibit an Unstable Dependency smell."
