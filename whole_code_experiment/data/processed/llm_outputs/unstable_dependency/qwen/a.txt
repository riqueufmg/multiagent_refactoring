"justification": "The package 'a' only contains internal dependencies between its own classes (RefCycleClass, RefCycleEnum, RefCycleClassFailure, RefClass2). There are no outgoing dependencies to other packages, so there cannot be unstable dependencies. All dependencies are self-contained within the package."
