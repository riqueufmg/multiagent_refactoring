"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.maxicode depends on com.google.zxing.maxicode.decoder and com.google.zxing.common. The com.google.zxing.maxicode.decoder package is less stable as it contains implementation details of the decoding process, while com.google.zxing.maxicode is a higher-level package that uses these decoders. However, the dependencies flow from the less stable decoder package to the more stable maxicode package, which follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. The com.google.zxing.common package is more stable as it contains common utilities used across multiple barcode formats. Therefore, the dependencies are in the correct direction according to stability."
