"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo does not exhibit Unstable Dependency. It depends on stable components such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor. These dependencies are more stable as they contain core model classes and interfaces that are less likely to change frequently. The package itself appears to be a utility package for creating histograms, which suggests a stable role within the system."
