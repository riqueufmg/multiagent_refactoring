{
"package": "demo",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The 'demo' package does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell. It depends on the 'com.github.javaparser.utils' package, which is part of a stable, external library (JavaParser). The 'demo' package itself is stable (it's a main package with no outgoing dependencies other than the stable JavaParser library), and thus it does not depend on less stable components. The dependencies flow from a less stable package ('demo') to a more stable one ('com.github.javaparser.utils'), which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle."
