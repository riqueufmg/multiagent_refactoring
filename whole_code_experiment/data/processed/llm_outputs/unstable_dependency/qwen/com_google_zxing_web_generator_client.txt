"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.web.generator.client contains multiple classes that implement the GeneratorSource interface and depend on each other internally. All classes within this package are cohesive and work together to generate QR codes for various content types. The dependencies are stable because they are all part of the same functional module with no external unstable dependencies. Classes like WifiGenerator, GeoLocationGenerator, EmailGenerator, etc., all depend on shared internal classes like StylesDefs, GeneratorException, and Validators, which are stable within the package. There are no outgoing dependencies to less stable external packages that would violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
