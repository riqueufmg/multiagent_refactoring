"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime contains runtime implementation classes (RuntimeJava, RuntimeScala, etc.) that depend on AbstractProcess and IRuntime from the same package, and on logger and process packages which are more stable utility components. The dependencies flow from concrete runtime implementations to more abstract and stable components, following the Stable Dependencies Principle. There are no dependencies on less stable packages."
