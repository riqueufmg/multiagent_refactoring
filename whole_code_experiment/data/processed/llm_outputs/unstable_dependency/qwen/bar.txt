```json
{
"package": "bar",
"detection": true,
"justification": "Package 'bar' has an unstable dependency because class 'bar.A' extends 'foo.A', creating an outgoing dependency from bar to foo. Since bar is less stable (it depends on foo), but it's depending on a package that should be more stable, this violates the Stable Dependencies Principle. The dependency direction goes from the less stable package (bar) to the more stable one (foo), which is the correct direction, but the smell occurs because bar is inherently unstable due to this dependency on foo."
