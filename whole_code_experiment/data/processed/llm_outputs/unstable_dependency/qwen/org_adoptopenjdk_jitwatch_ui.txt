"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (via import org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil and others), which represents a dependency on a less stable package. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Since UI packages typically change more frequently than utility packages, this creates an unstable dependency."
