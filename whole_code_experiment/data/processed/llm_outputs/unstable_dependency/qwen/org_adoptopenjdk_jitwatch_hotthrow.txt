"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation. The model package contains core data structures and is likely more stable due to its foundational nature. The compilation package, while containing utility classes, appears to be part of the same architectural layer and likely has similar or lower stability. Since the hotthrow package depends on packages that are equally or less stable, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. There is no evidence of dependency on less stable packages that would constitute an Unstable Dependency smell."
