"package": "org.apache.commons.io.file.spi",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.io.file.spi has no outgoing dependencies to other packages within the codebase, and its stability is determined by its reliance only on standard Java libraries (java.net, java.nio.file, etc.). Since there are no inter-package dependencies violating the Stable Dependencies Principle, this is not an Unstable Dependency smell."
