The stability of 'foo.bar.differentpackage' is higher than 'foo.bar' because it has fewer incoming dependencies (0) compared to 'foo.bar' which has incoming dependencies from 'foo.bar.differentpackage'. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, 'foo.bar.differentpackage' should not depend on a less stable package like 'foo.bar'."
