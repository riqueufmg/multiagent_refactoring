"justification": "The package org.gradle.api.file does not exhibit unstable dependency. It has minimal outgoing dependencies, only depending on java.io.File and org.gradle.api.provider.Provider. It does not depend on any other packages with higher instability. The package is relatively stable as it contains only interface definitions (DirectoryProperty, Directory) with no complex dependencies or implementations that would introduce instability."
