"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.parserchooser",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.parserchooser has stable dependencies. It only depends on the org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser package (via ParserType enum) which is more stable since it contains core parsing logic that changes less frequently than UI components. The parserchooser package itself contains simple UI components (interface and chooser class) with minimal complexity and few dependencies, making it relatively stable. There are no dependencies on less stable packages, thus no unstable dependency smell is detected."
