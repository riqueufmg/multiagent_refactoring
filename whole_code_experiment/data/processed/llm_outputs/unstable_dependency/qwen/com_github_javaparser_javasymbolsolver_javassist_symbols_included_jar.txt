"package": "com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.included_jar",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package contains only two simple classes (SuperClassIncludedJar and InterfaceIncludedJar) with no outgoing dependencies to other packages. Both classes only contain static final fields and no complex logic or external dependencies. Since there are no dependencies on less stable packages, there is no unstable dependency smell."
