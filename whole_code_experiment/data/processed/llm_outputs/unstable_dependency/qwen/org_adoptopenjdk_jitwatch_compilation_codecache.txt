"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.codecache contains two classes: CodeCacheWalkerResult and CodeCacheEventWalker. CodeCacheEventWalker depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model package classes such as CodeCacheEvent, Compilation, IMetaMember, and IReadOnlyJITDataModel. However, the stability analysis shows that the codecache package itself doesn't exhibit unstable dependency - it depends on more stable model classes, and there's no evidence that this package is less stable than the packages it depends on. The dependencies flow from this package to more stable packages, following the Stable Dependencies Principle."
