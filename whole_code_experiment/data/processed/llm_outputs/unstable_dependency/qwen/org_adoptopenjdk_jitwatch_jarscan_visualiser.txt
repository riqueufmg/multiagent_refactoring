"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.visualiser has outgoing dependencies on javafx and java.awt packages, which are relatively stable platform packages. It also depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil, which appears to be a utility class within the same project. The package does not exhibit unstable dependencies as it does not depend on packages that are less stable than itself. The dependencies are primarily on standard JavaFX libraries and internal utilities, indicating a stable dependency pattern."
