"package": "(default package)",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The default package does not exhibit Unstable Dependency. While it depends on com.github.javaparser.quality (Preconditions class), this dependency is stable as Preconditions is a final class with only static methods and no dependencies, making it highly stable. All other classes in the default package are self-contained or have minimal dependencies. There are no incoming dependencies from other packages, and the outgoing dependency to Preconditions does not violate stability principles since Preconditions is more stable than the default package components."
