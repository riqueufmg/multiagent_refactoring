"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report' depends on several other packages like 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.cell', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.inlining', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.locks', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.suggestion', and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util'. These dependencies make it less stable because changes in any of these dependent packages can affect this package. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Since this package depends on multiple other packages, it is considered unstable, leading to an Unstable Dependency smell."
