"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement depends on com.google.zxing.client.android.history and com.google.zxing.client.result. Both of these packages are more stable than the supplement package, as they contain core functionality and data models that are less likely to change frequently. The supplement package contains classes that retrieve additional information based on scan results, making it more volatile and less stable. Therefore, the dependencies follow the Stable Dependencies Principle, with the less stable package depending on more stable ones."
