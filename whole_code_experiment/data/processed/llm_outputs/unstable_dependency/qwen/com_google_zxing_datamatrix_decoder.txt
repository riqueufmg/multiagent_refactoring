"package": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder shows a stable dependency architecture. It primarily depends on internal packages (com.google.zxing.common, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder) and stable external dependencies like java.nio.charset, java.util. All outgoing dependencies are to more stable or equally stable packages. There are no incoming dependencies from less stable packages that would violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. The package depends on fundamental, stable ZXing core classes (FormatException, BitSource, DecoderResult, ECIStringBuilder) and standard Java libraries, indicating a proper dependency direction toward stability."
