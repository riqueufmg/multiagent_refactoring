"package": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.detector",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.pdf417.detector has dependencies on com.google.zxing and com.google.zxing.common packages. These dependencies are stable foundational packages of the ZXing library that provide core functionality like BinaryBitmap, ResultPoint, BitMatrix, NotFoundException, and DecodeHintType. The detector package itself is a specialized component for PDF417 barcode detection and follows the Stable Dependencies Principle by depending on more stable, core library components rather than less stable packages. Therefore, no unstable dependency smell is detected."
