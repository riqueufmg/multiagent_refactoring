"package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.cache",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.cache contains cache implementations (InMemoryCache, NoCache, GuavaCache) and a default statistics implementation (DefaultCacheStats). These classes depend on the com.github.javaparser.resolution.cache package for the Cache and CacheStats interfaces, which is appropriate as they are implementing these interfaces. The dependency direction is from the more concrete implementation package to the more abstract interface package, following the Stable Dependencies Principle. There are no dependencies on less stable packages, and the package structure shows proper layering with stable interfaces being depended upon by their implementations."
