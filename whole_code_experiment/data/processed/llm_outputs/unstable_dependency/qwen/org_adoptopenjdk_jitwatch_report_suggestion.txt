"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.suggestion contains the SuggestionWalker class which depends on several other packages from the same project (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core) as well as standard Java libraries and a third-party logging library (com.chrisnewland.freelogj). These dependencies are either at the same level of stability or more stable (standard Java libraries), and the internal dependencies follow a logical architectural flow where this package builds upon lower-level components. There are no dependencies on less stable packages that would violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
