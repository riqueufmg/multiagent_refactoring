"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor, which are more stable packages as they contain core model classes and interfaces. There are no incoming dependencies from less stable packages that would violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. The package depends on more stable components (model, treevisitor) and does not exhibit unstable dependency."
