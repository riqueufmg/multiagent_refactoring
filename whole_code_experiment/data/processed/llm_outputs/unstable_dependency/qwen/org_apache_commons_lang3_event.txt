"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.lang3.event has stable dependencies. It depends on org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.MethodUtils and org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ExceptionUtils which are stable utility classes within the same library (Apache Commons Lang3). These dependencies are more stable than the event package itself since they provide fundamental utility functions. There are no dependencies on less stable packages, and the dependencies follow the Stable Dependencies Principle."
