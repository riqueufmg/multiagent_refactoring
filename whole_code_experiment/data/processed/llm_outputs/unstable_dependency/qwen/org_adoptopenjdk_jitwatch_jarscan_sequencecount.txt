"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan, and no incoming dependencies from other packages. Since it depends on more stable packages (like org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode which is likely to be more stable due to its foundational role) and does not have dependencies from less stable packages, it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
