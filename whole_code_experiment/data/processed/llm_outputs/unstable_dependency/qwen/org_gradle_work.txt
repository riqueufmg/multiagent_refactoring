"justification": "The package org.gradle.work only contains placeholder classes (ChangeType, FileChange, InputChanges) that represent Gradle's API types. These classes have no outgoing dependencies on other packages - they only contain basic method signatures without implementations. The package also has no incoming dependencies shown from other packages in the provided code. Since there are no actual dependencies between packages, there is no unstable dependency smell to detect."
