"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage has minimal outgoing dependencies (primarily to javafx.stage.Stage) and no significant incoming dependencies from other packages shown in the code. It primarily contains UI-related classes (IStageClosedListener, StageManager) that manage stage lifecycle events and communication. The dependencies are stable (JavaFX) and the package itself appears to be relatively stable with simple interfaces and manager classes. There are no signs of depending on less stable components."
