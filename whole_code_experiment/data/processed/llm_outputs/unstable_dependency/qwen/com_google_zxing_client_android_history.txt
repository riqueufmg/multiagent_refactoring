"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.client.android.history shows stable dependency characteristics. It primarily depends on core ZXing library classes (com.google.zxing.*) which are more stable than this package itself. The history package contains classes for managing scan history functionality including HistoryItem, HistoryManager, DBHelper, and HistoryActivity. Its dependencies flow towards more stable packages - it depends on the core ZXing library for barcode processing (Result, BarcodeFormat) and Android framework classes for UI and storage. The package does not exhibit unstable dependency patterns as it doesn't depend on less stable packages while being relatively unstable itself. The dependencies are properly directed from less stable to more stable components, following the Stable Dependencies Principle."
