"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser has minimal outgoing dependencies, only importing core JavaFX classes and a few interfaces from the same project (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model). It does not depend on any less stable packages. The package is itself a UI component with low complexity and clear separation of concerns, indicating stability. There are no incoming dependencies from less stable packages that would violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
