"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.methodsizehisto has no incoming dependencies and only depends on packages that are more stable than itself. It depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core (which is part of the same project and likely more stable), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan (its parent package), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (a core model package), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (a specialized model package). These dependencies follow the Stable Dependencies Principle as the dependent packages are foundational and less likely to change frequently compared to this specific operation implementation."
