"package": "a.b.c",
"detection": true,
"justification": "Package a.b.c has an unstable dependency on package d.e.f. The class ExampleClass in a.b.c imports d.e.f.DataObjectFactory, creating an outgoing dependency. Since a.b.c depends on d.e.f, according to the Stable Dependencies Principle, d.e.f should be more stable than a.b.c. However, there is no information indicating that d.e.f is more stable, and typically, importing external packages suggests a dependency on a less stable component, thus constituting an Unstable Dependency smell."
