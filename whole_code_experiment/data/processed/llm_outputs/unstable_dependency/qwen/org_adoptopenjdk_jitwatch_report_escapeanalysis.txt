It depends on packages like org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report which are more stable components of the system. The AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker class extends AbstractReportBuilder and uses various model classes, following the Stable Dependencies Principle where less stable packages depend on more stable ones. The dependencies flow from less stable to more stable packages, adhering to the stability dependency principle."
