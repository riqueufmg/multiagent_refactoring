"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly shows good stability characteristics. It has a clear dependency on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core for constants and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util for utilities, which are likely more stable foundational packages. The assembly package contains specialized parsers for different architectures (x86, ARM) and related classes that form a cohesive unit for assembly processing. Dependencies are primarily on standard Java libraries (java.util, java.io, java.lang) and well-established external libraries (com.chrisnewland.freelogj for logging, org.xml.sax for XML parsing). The package structure demonstrates good encapsulation with interfaces (IAssemblyParser) and abstract classes (AbstractAssemblyParser) providing stable contracts. There are no indications of unstable dependencies where less stable packages depend on more stable ones - the dependencies flow toward foundational, more stable packages."
