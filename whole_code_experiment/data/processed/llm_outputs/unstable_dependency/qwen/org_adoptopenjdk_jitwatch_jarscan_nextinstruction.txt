"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount. Both of these packages are more stable (have more incoming dependencies and are core model packages) than the nextinstruction package. The nextinstruction package itself has no incoming dependencies, making it unstable. Since it only depends on more stable packages, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell detected."
