"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger is stable as it only contains simple interface and implementation classes (ILogListener, StdLogListener, NullLogListener) with no external dependencies. It follows the Stable Dependencies Principle as it has low instability (I=0) - it doesn't depend on any other packages, and other packages depend on it. The package serves as a stable abstraction layer for logging functionality."
