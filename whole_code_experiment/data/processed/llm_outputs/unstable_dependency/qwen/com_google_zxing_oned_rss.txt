"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.oned.rss contains classes that are part of a cohesive module for reading RSS family barcodes. The classes within this package have high cohesion as they all relate to RSS barcode processing. The package depends on com.google.zxing.common and com.google.zxing.common.detector for shared utilities like BitArray, BitMatrix, MathUtils, and detector classes, which are stable foundational components. These dependencies are stable because they provide basic data structures and common utilities that are unlikely to change frequently. The package does not depend on less stable packages; instead, it depends on more stable ones. Therefore, it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
