"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic' containing the class 'IntrinsicFinder' depends on several classes from the 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model' package (e.g., Compilation, IMetaMember, IParseDictionary, LogParseException, Tag) and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation' package (e.g., AbstractCompilationVisitable, CompilationUtil). These dependencies are towards more stable, core model and compilation utility classes which are less likely to change frequently. The 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic' package itself appears to be a specialized utility package for finding intrinsics, suggesting it is relatively stable. There is no evidence that this package depends on packages that are less stable than itself, thus the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated."
