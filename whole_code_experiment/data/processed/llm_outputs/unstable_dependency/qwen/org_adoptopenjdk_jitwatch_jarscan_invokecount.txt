"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.invokecount does not exhibit Unstable Dependency. It has a stable design with classes that are interdependent but maintain clear responsibilities. The classes InvokeMethodCountMap, MethodCountMap, and InvokeCountOperation work together cohesively, with InvokeCountOperation depending on the other two for functionality. All dependencies are within the same package, and there are no external dependencies on less stable components. The package structure follows the Stable Dependencies Principle as it does not depend on packages that are less stable than itself."
