"justification": "The package 'com.google.gson.protobuf' containing 'ProtoTypeAdapter' depends on 'com.google.gson' and 'com.google.protobuf'. Both of these are more stable libraries (Gson is a core JSON library and Protobuf is a Google standard for serialization). The 'ProtoTypeAdapter' is designed to bridge these two stable libraries, and it does not depend on less stable components. It adheres to the Stable Dependencies Principle by depending on more stable packages."
