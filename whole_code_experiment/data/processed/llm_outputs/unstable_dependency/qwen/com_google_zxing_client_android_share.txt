"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.client.android.share depends on com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard (ClipboardInterface) and core com.google.zxing classes (BarcodeFormat). These dependencies are stable as they are part of the same library ecosystem and provide fundamental functionality. The share package does not depend on any less stable components - it depends on more stable or equally stable components within the ZXing library architecture."
