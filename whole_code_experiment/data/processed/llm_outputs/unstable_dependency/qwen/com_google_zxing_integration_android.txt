"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.integration.android contains only two classes, IntentIntegrator and IntentResult, which are designed to integrate with the ZXing barcode scanning library. The IntentIntegrator class depends on standard Android SDK classes (Activity, Fragment, Intent, etc.) and Java standard library classes (Collections, HashMap, etc.). These dependencies are stable and part of the core platform. There are no dependencies on other less stable packages or components. The package follows the Stable Dependencies Principle as it depends only on more stable components (Android SDK and Java standard library)."
