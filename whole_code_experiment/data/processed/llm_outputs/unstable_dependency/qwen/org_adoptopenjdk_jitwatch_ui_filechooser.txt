"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.filechooser",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.filechooser has stable dependencies. It depends on javafx packages which are standard library packages (high stability) and on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util which appears to be a utility package within the same project (assumed to be more stable than UI components). The package itself contains UI components (FileChooserList, FileChooserListSrcZip) which are likely to be less stable than the packages they depend on, following the Stable Dependencies Principle correctly. No unstable dependency smell detected."
