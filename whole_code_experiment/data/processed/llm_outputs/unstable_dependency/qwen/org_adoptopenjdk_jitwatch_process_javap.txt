"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.javap contains classes JavapProcess and ReflectionJavap. JavapProcess extends AbstractProcess which is not in the same package, but there's no evidence of instability in the dependency. ReflectionJavap uses classes from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader (DisposableURLClassLoader) and com.chrisnewland.freelogj (Logger, LoggerFactory). However, these dependencies do not indicate that the package depends on less stable components. The package appears to have stable dependencies as it depends on well-established logging and utility classes, and does not show signs of violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
