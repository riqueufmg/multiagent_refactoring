"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.demo has no outgoing dependencies to other packages, as all imports are from standard Java libraries (java.util, com.chrisnewland.freelogj) or internal classes. Since there are no dependencies on other project packages, there is no possibility of unstable dependency smell arising from inter-package dependencies. The class MakeHotSpotLog is self-contained regarding package-level dependencies."
