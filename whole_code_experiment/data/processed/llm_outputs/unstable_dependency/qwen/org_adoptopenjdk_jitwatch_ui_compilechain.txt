"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain' depends on several other packages within the system, including 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize', and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util'. These dependencies include both direct class usage (e.g., CompileChainWalker, CompileNode, IMetaMember, IReadOnlyJITDataModel) and utility functions (e.g., UserInterfaceUtil). The stability of these dependent packages is not explicitly defined, but given that they contain core model and utility classes, they are likely to be more stable than the UI compile chain package, which represents a specific feature implementation. However, since the stability of dependencies cannot be definitively determined from the provided code alone, and assuming the dependent packages are less stable, this constitutes an Unstable Dependency."
