"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard is a utility package that provides clipboard functionality. It has minimal dependencies, relying only on standard Android classes (android.content.ClipData, android.content.ClipboardManager, android.content.Context, android.util.Log). It does not depend on any other internal packages from the application. The package is stable due to its focused, utility nature and lack of complex dependencies. Since this package doesn't have outgoing dependencies to other less stable packages, it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
