"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell. It depends on several other packages including org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util. These dependencies are stable components (model classes, utility classes, and core functionality) that are less likely to change frequently. The package itself appears to be a utility package for generating top lists and statistics, which typically depends on more stable core components. There are no indications that this package depends on less stable components in violation of the Stable Dependencies Principle."
