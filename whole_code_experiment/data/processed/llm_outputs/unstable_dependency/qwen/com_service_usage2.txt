"package": "com.service.usage2",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.service.usage2 has an outgoing dependency to com.service.definition (importing ServiceDefinition). To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we need to consider the stability of both packages. However, with only one class shown in com.service.usage2 and its dependency on com.service.definition, and without information about incoming dependencies or the full structure of com.service.definition, we cannot definitively conclude that com.service.usage2 is less stable than its dependency. The package appears to be a simple implementation package depending on a definition/interface package, which is a typical stable dependency pattern where the implementation depends on the more stable interface/definition."
