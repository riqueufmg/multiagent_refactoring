"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain has a stable dependency architecture. It depends on more stable packages like org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (which contains core data structures) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (which contains utility functions). The chain package is less stable than these dependencies, following the Stable Dependencies Principle. Classes in this package (CompileNode, CompileChainWalker) are used by UI components (CompileChainStage) but don't create unstable dependency cycles."
