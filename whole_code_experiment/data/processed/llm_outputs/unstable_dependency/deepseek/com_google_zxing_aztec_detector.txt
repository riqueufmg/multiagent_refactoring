  "justification": "The package com.google.zxing.aztec.detector depends on multiple less stable packages. It has outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing.aztec (AztecDetectorResult), com.google.zxing.common (BitMatrix, GridSampler, MathUtils, WhiteRectangleDetector, GenericGF, ReedSolomonDecoder), com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon (ReedSolomonException), and com.google.zxing (NotFoundException, ResultPoint). These dependent packages have higher incoming dependencies (fan-in) and are more widely used, making them more stable. The detector package has relatively low incoming dependencies (fan-in), making it less stable. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a less stable package should not depend on more stable packages, but here the detector package depends on more stable packages, creating an unstable dependency architecture smell."
