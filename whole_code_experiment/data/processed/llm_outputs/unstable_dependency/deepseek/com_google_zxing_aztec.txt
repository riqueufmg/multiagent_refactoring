  "package": "com.google.zxing.aztec",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The package com.google.zxing.aztec depends on less stable packages. It has outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing.common (DetectorResult, BitMatrix, DecoderResult, etc.) and com.google.zxing (Result, ResultPoint, BarcodeFormat, etc.), which are more widely used and have higher incoming dependencies. The aztec package is more specialized and has fewer incoming dependencies, making it more stable than the packages it depends on, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
