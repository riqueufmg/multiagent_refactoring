"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.escapeanalysis",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.AbstractReportBuilder which has 0 incoming dependencies (unstable) and 1 outgoing dependency, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report which has 1 incoming dependency (from escapeanalysis) and 0 outgoing dependencies (stable). Since escapeanalysis depends on less stable components (AbstractReportBuilder with 0 incoming dependencies), it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle."
