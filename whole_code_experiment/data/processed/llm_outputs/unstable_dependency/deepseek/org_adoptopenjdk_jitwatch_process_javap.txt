"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.javap",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has 2 outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.AbstractProcess (parent package) and com.chrisnewland.freelogj.Logger (external logging library). It has 1 incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.BytecodeLoader. The package depends on AbstractProcess which is in a parent package (more stable) and an external logging library (stable), but it is depended upon by BytecodeLoader which is in a different package hierarchy. The package has low stability (few incoming dependencies, some outgoing dependencies) but depends on more stable components, so it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle."
