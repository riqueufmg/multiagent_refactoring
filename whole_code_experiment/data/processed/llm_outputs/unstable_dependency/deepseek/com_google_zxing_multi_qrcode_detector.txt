{
"package": "com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package depends on less stable packages: com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector (Detector, FinderPatternFinder, FinderPatternInfo, FinderPattern) and com.google.zxing.common (DetectorResult, BitMatrix). These dependencies have higher incoming dependencies (wider usage) and lower outgoing dependencies, making them more stable. The analyzed package has fewer incoming dependencies and higher outgoing dependencies, making it less stable. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a less stable package should not depend on more stable packages, but here it does, creating an unstable dependency."
