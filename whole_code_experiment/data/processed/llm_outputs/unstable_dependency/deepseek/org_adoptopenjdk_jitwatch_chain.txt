"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has 2 outgoing dependencies to less stable packages: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (fan-in: 0, fan-out: 0) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation (fan-in: 0, fan-out: 0). Both dependent packages have zero incoming dependencies (fan-in=0), making them highly unstable according to the Stable Dependencies Principle. The analyzed package depends on these unstable packages, violating the principle."
