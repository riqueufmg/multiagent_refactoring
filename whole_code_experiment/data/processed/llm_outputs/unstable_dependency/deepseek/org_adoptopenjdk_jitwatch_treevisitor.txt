"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, which has 0 incoming dependencies from treevisitor but 28 outgoing dependencies to other packages (including treevisitor). This makes the model package highly unstable (instability = 1.0), while treevisitor has lower instability. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, treevisitor should not depend on the less stable model package."
