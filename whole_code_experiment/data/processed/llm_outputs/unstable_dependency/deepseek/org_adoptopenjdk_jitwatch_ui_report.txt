"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has 5 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.cell, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util) and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.locks). The high number of outgoing dependencies compared to incoming dependencies indicates it depends on many less stable components, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
