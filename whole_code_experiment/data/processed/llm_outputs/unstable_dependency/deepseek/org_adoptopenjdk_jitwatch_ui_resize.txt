"justification": "The package has only 2 classes (RateLimitedResizeListener and IRedrawable) with no outgoing dependencies to other packages. It has incoming dependencies from multiple packages (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain) that depend on its IRedrawable interface and RateLimitedResizeListener class, making it highly stable with many dependents and no dependencies."
