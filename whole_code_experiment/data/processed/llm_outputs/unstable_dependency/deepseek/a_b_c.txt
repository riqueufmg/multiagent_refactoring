"package": "a.b.c",
"detection": true,
"justification": "Package a.b.c has an outgoing dependency to d.e.f.DataObjectFactory (imported in ExampleClass), but d.e.f is not listed among the analyzed packages, making its stability unknown. Since a.b.c depends on an external package with potentially lower stability, this violates the Stable Dependencies Principle."
