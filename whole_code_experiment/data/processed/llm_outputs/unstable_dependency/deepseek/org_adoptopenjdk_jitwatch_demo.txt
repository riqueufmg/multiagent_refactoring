"justification": "Package depends on com.chrisnewland.freelogj.Logger and com.chrisnewland.freelogj.LoggerFactory which are external dependencies. These external packages are likely less stable than the demo package itself, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle where a package should only depend on more stable packages."
