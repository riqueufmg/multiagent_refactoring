"detection": true,
"justification": "The package depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode packages which are much larger and more complex (containing 30+ classes each with extensive functionality). The dependent packages have high incoming dependencies from other parts of the system, making them less stable. The analyzed package has only 1 class with simple functionality, making it more stable than its dependencies, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
