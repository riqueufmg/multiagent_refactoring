"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has outgoing dependencies to less stable packages: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow (contains only 2 classes), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation (contains only 4 classes), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor (contains only 2 classes), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic (contains only 1 class), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (contains many classes but appears to be a utility package with high cohesion). These dependent packages have fewer classes and are likely less stable than the toplist package which contains 12 classes and multiple concrete implementations. The toplist package depends on these less stable packages, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
