"detection": true,
"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.oned.rss depends on less stable packages. It has outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing.common (e.g., BitArray, BitMatrix, DetectorResult) and com.google.zxing (e.g., Result, ResultPoint, BarcodeFormat), which are more widely used and thus more stable. The incoming dependencies are minimal (only from com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded), indicating lower stability of com.google.zxing.oned.rss compared to its dependencies, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
