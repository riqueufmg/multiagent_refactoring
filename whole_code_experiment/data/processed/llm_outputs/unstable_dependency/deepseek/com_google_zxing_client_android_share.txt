{
"package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.share",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package depends on com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard.ClipboardInterface, which has no incoming dependencies from other packages (only used by ShareActivity), making it less stable (more prone to change) than the share package. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle where a package should depend only on more stable packages."
