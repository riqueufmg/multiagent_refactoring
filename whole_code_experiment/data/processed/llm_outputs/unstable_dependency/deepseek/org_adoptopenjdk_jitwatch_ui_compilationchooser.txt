{
  "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The package depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Compilation, IMetaMember) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (IMemberSelectedListener). The model package has many incoming dependencies from multiple UI packages (e.g., ui.main, ui.triview, ui.compilechain) and is therefore more stable. The UI packages have fewer incoming dependencies and more outgoing dependencies, making them less stable. Since org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser depends on the more stable model package, it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. However, it also depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main, which is less stable (UI layer with many outgoing dependencies). This creates an unstable dependency because the package depends on a less stable component (ui.main)."
