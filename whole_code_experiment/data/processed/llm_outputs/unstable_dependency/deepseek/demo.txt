"justification": "Package 'demo' depends on package 'com.github.javaparser.utils' which has 0 incoming dependencies and 0 outgoing dependencies (based on provided code), making it less stable than 'demo'. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle as a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
