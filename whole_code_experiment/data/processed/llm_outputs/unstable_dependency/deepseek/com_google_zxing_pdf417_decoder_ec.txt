"package": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package depends on com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Common (imported in ModulusGF) and com.google.zxing.ChecksumException (imported in ErrorCorrection). PDF417Common is a utility class with only static constants and methods, making it highly stable (low outgoing dependencies). ChecksumException is a simple exception class with minimal dependencies, also highly stable. However, the package itself contains only three tightly coupled classes (ModulusGF, ModulusPoly, ErrorCorrection) that depend on each other and have no incoming dependencies from outside the package, making it highly unstable (low incoming dependencies, high outgoing dependencies relative to its size). According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, an unstable package should not depend on more stable packages, but here the unstable package depends on stable external packages, violating the principle."
