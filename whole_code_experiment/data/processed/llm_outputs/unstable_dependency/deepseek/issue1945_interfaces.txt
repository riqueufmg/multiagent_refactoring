"justification": "Package 'issue1945.implementations' depends on 'issue1945.interfaces' (outgoing dependency). 'issue1945.interfaces' has 0 outgoing dependencies and 3 incoming dependencies (from 'issue1945.implementations' and 'issue1945.main'), making it highly stable (I=3, O=0). 'issue1945.implementations' has 1 outgoing dependency and 1 incoming dependency (from 'issue1945.main'), making it less stable (I=1, O=1). Since a less stable package depends on a more stable one, this violates the Stable Dependencies Principle."
