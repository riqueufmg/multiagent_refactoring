"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.codecache",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has 2 outgoing dependencies to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (CodeCacheEvent, Compilation, IMetaMember, IReadOnlyJITDataModel) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation (AbstractCompilationWalker). It has 0 incoming dependencies from other packages. This indicates it depends on less stable components (higher outgoing dependencies, zero incoming dependencies), violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
