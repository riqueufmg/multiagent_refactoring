  "justification": "The package com.github.javaparser.resolution.promotion depends on com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, which is part of a larger, more stable package (com.github.javaparser.resolution.types) with multiple incoming dependencies. The dependent package has 10 classes/interfaces (ResolvedType, ResolvedPrimitiveType, ResolvedLambdaConstraintType, ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedUnionType, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedIntersectionType, ResolvedVoidType, ResolvedTypeTransformer, ResolvedTypeVariable, ResolvedArrayType) and is imported by multiple other packages (including com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.promotion), indicating higher stability. The analyzed package has only one class (ConditionalExprHandler) and depends on this more stable component, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
