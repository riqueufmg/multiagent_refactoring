"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has 5 outgoing dependencies to more stable packages (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConstants, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil, com.chrisnewland.freelogj.Logger, com.chrisnewland.freelogj.LoggerFactory) and 1 incoming dependency from the less stable package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly. The outgoing dependencies are to packages with higher abstraction levels and broader usage, indicating they are more stable. The single incoming dependency is from a UI package which is typically less stable due to frequent changes, but this doesn't violate the Stable Dependencies Principle since dependencies flow toward stability."
