"detection": true,
"justification": "The package depends on less stable packages: com.google.zxing.client.android (contains many classes with high incoming dependencies from other parts of the application) and com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open (has fewer incoming dependencies). The package has outgoing dependencies to these less stable packages while having relatively few incoming dependencies itself, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
