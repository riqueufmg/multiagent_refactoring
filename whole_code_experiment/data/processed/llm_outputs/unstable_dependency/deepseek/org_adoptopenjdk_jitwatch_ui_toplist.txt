"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.toplist depends on multiple packages that are less stable. It has outgoing dependencies to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist (which contains many concrete implementations and abstract classes), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (which contains numerous core model classes with high responsibility), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (which contains UI components with many dependencies), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (which contains utility classes). These dependent packages have more incoming dependencies and are more likely to change, making them less stable than the UI top list package, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
