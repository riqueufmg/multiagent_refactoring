"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.inline",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model which has 25 classes, indicating high instability, while org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.inline has only 3 classes. The package also depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation (4 classes) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor (1 class), both of which are less stable than the dependent package. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle as the package depends on less stable components."
