"package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard depends on the less stable package com.google.zxing.client.android. The dependent package contains numerous classes (e.g., CaptureActivity, PreferencesActivity, Intents) that are frequently changed and have high fan-out dependencies, making it less stable. The analyzed package has only one class (ClipboardInterface) with minimal functionality, making it more stable. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle as a more stable package depends on a less stable one."
