  "package": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.util",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The package com.google.gson.internal.bind.util has only one class ISO8601Utils which has no outgoing dependencies to other packages. However, it is being depended upon by multiple classes in the com.google.gson.internal.bind package (specifically DefaultDateTypeAdapter which imports com.google.gson.internal.bind.util.ISO8601Utils). This creates an unstable dependency where a more stable package (internal.bind.util with no outgoing dependencies) is being depended upon by a less stable package (internal.bind with many classes and dependencies), violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
