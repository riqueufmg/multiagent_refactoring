  "package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.event",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The package org.apache.commons.lang3.event depends on org.apache.commons.lang3.function (via FailableConsumer in EventListenerSupport) and org.apache.commons.lang3.exception (via ExceptionUtils in EventListenerSupport). These dependent packages have many incoming dependencies (they are widely used utility packages) and are therefore more stable. The event package has fewer incoming dependencies (it's more specialized), making it less stable. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a less stable package should not depend on more stable packages, but here org.apache.commons.lang3.event depends on more stable packages, creating an unstable dependency architecture smell."
