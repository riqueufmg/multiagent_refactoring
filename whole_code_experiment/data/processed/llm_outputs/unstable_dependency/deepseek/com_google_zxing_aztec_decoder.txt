"package": "com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder depends on com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.ReedSolomonDecoder and com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.GenericGF, which are less stable components. ReedSolomonDecoder and GenericGF have no incoming dependencies from other packages, indicating they are highly unstable (instability = 1). The aztec.decoder package has incoming dependencies from com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecReader, making it more stable than the reedsolomon packages. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle as a more stable package depends on less stable packages."
