"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger",
"detection": false,
"justification": "Package has 3 classes (ILogListener, StdLogListener, NullLogListener) with no outgoing dependencies. It has incoming dependencies from multiple packages (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main). This makes it highly stable (many dependents, no dependencies), so it cannot have unstable dependency issues."
