"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.viewer",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has outgoing dependencies to less stable packages: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (depends on JITWatchUI) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview (depends on Viewer). These packages have higher incoming dependencies (JITWatchUI is central UI component, Viewer is used by multiple UI components) making them more stable, while org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.viewer has fewer incoming dependencies and depends on these more stable packages, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
