"justification": "The package depends on less stable packages: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (incoming dependencies: 0, outgoing dependencies: 4) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report (incoming dependencies: 0, outgoing dependencies: 2). These dependencies have fewer incoming dependencies compared to the analyzed package, making them less stable according to the Stable Dependencies Principle."
