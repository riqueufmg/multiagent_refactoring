"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic has 0 incoming dependencies and 2 outgoing dependencies (to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model). It depends on less stable packages: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation has 0 incoming dependencies and 4 outgoing dependencies, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model has 0 incoming dependencies and 2 outgoing dependencies. Since the analyzed package has no incoming dependencies, it is highly unstable, but it depends on packages that are also unstable (with 0 incoming dependencies), violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
