```json
{
  "package": "com.example",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The package 'com.example' depends on the less stable package 'com.google.gson' (which contains numerous classes like Gson, JsonElement, TypeAdapter, etc.). 'com.example' has high outgoing dependencies to 'com.google.gson' (many imports) and low incoming dependencies (likely only used by tests), making it less stable than 'com.google.gson'. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle."
