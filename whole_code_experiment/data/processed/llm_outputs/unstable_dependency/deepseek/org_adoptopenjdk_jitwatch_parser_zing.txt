{
"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.zing",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has 2 outgoing dependencies to less stable packages: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (depends on 21 classes) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core (depends on 9 classes). These dependent packages have higher incoming dependencies (model: 21 classes, core: 9 classes) compared to the analyzed package's incoming dependencies (0 classes), making them less stable. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle where a package should only depend on more stable packages."
