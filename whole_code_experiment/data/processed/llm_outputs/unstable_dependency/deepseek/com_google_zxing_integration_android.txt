"detection": true,
"justification": "The package depends on Android framework classes (android.app.Activity, android.app.Fragment, android.content.Intent, etc.) which are less stable external dependencies. It also depends on com.google.zxing.client.android package (BS_PACKAGE) which is an external application package that could change independently. The package has high outgoing dependencies to less stable external components while having minimal incoming dependencies, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
