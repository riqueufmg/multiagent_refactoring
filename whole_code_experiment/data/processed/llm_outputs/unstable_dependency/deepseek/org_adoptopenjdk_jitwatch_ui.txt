"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui has 0 incoming dependencies and 2 outgoing dependencies (to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConstants and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil). The dependent package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util has 0 incoming dependencies and 0 outgoing dependencies, making it more stable (higher incoming/outgoing ratio). Since the UI package depends on a more stable package, this violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, creating an Unstable Dependency smell."
