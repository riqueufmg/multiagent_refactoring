  "package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.history",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The package depends on less stable packages. It has outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing (Result, BarcodeFormat) and com.google.zxing.client.android.result (ResultHandler), which are more volatile due to their broader usage and external dependencies. The package itself is relatively stable with only internal classes (HistoryItem, HistoryManager, HistoryItemAdapter, DBHelper, HistoryActivity) depending on it, but it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle by depending on less stable external packages."
