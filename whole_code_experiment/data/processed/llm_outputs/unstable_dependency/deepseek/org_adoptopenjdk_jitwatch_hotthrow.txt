"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow depends on multiple packages that are more stable (higher incoming dependencies) such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode. These dependent packages have extensive incoming dependencies from other packages in the system, making them more stable. The hotthrow package has relatively few incoming dependencies, making it less stable, yet it depends on these more stable packages, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
