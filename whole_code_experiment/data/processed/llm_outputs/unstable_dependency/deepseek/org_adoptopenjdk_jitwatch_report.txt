```json
{
"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has 3 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor) and only 0 incoming dependencies. The dependent packages (especially org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model with 30+ classes) are much larger and more complex, making them less stable. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should depend on more stable packages, but here org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report depends on less stable packages, creating an unstable dependency architecture smell."
