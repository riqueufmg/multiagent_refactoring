"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.suggestion",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package depends on multiple less stable packages including org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (contains many concrete classes with frequent changes), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation (contains specialized compilation utilities), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (contains utility classes with diverse responsibilities). These dependencies have higher volatility due to their broader scope and more frequent modifications compared to the specialized suggestion package, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
