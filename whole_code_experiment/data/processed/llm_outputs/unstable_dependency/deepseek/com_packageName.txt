"detection": false,
"justification": "Package com.packageName has outgoing dependencies to the default package (through classes like PackageDotExpressions), but the default package has no incoming dependencies from other packages, making it highly unstable. However, com.packageName itself has no incoming dependencies from other packages, so its stability cannot be compared to determine if it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle."
