'foo.bar' has 0 outgoing dependencies but 2 incoming dependencies (from 'foo.bar.differentpackage'), making it more stable (lower instability). 'foo.bar.differentpackage' has 2 outgoing dependencies and 0 incoming dependencies, making it less stable (higher instability). The less stable package depends on a more stable package, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
