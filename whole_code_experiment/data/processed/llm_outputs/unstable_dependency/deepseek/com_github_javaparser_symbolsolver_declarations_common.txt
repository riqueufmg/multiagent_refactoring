"justification": "The package depends on less stable packages: com.github.javaparser.resolution.types (contains 11 classes), com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic (contains 6 classes), com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations (contains 24 classes), com.github.javaparser.resolution (contains 11 classes), com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.core.resolution (contains 3 classes), com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel (contains 17 classes), com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.logic (contains 3 classes). These dependent packages have significantly more classes and appear to be foundational/core packages, suggesting they are more stable (higher incoming dependencies). The analyzed package has only 1 class and depends on many larger, more stable packages, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
