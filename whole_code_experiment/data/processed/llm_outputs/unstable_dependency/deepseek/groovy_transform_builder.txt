    "justification": "The package has outgoing dependencies to more stable packages (e.g., groovy.transform.Undefined, org.codehaus.groovy.ast.*, org.codehaus.groovy.transform.*, org.objectweb.asm.Opcodes) which are foundational libraries with likely higher stability. It has no incoming dependencies from the provided context, indicating it is less stable itself, but it depends on more stable components, adhering to the Stable Dependencies Principle."
