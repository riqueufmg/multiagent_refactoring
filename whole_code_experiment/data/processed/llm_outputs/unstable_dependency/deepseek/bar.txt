```json
{
"package": "bar",
"detection": true,
"justification": "Package 'bar' depends on package 'foo' (via class A extends foo.A). Since 'foo' has no incoming dependencies shown and 'bar' has at least one outgoing dependency, 'foo' is more stable than 'bar'. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle because 'bar' depends on a more stable component, making it an unstable dependency."
