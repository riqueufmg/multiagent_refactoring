{
"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has 6 outgoing dependencies (imports from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler, and com.chrisnewland.freelogj) but only 1 incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager). This indicates the package is highly unstable as it depends on many other packages but has few dependents, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle where packages should depend in the direction of stability."
