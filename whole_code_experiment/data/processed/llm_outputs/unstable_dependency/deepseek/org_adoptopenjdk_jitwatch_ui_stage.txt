"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (through imports of IMetaMember, Compilation, etc.) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (through ICompilationChangeListener). These dependent packages contain numerous classes with complex dependencies among themselves (e.g., model classes depend on each other extensively) and have many incoming dependencies from other UI packages (e.g., ui.main, ui.sandbox, ui.report). The dependent packages appear more stable (higher incoming dependencies) compared to the analyzed package, which has fewer incoming dependencies. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle as the less stable package (ui.stage) depends on more stable packages."
