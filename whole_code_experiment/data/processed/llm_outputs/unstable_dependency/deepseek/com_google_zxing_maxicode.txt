"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.maxicode depends on com.google.zxing.maxicode.decoder, which is a subpackage and likely more stable due to its specialized nature. It also depends on com.google.zxing.common and other core packages which are highly stable foundational components. The dependencies appear to follow the Stable Dependencies Principle with more stable packages being depended upon."
