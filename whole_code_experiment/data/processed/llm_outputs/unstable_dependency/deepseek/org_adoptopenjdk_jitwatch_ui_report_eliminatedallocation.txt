"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package depends on less stable packages: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report (contains abstract classes and interfaces), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.cell (contains UI cell implementations), and javafx packages (external UI framework). These dependencies have higher volatility due to UI concerns and abstraction layers, making them less stable than the specialized eliminatedallocation package which has only 2 concrete classes."
