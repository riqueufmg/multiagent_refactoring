"package": "main",
"detection": true,
"justification": "Package 'main' has outgoing dependencies to package 'another' (via imports of 'another.A', 'another.*', 'another.MyEnum.A'), but 'another' is not defined in the provided context, implying it is external and likely less stable. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle as 'main' depends on a less stable external package."
