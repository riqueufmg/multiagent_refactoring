{
  "package": "com.google.gson.protobuf",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The package com.google.gson.protobuf depends on the less stable package com.google.gson. The com.google.gson.protobuf package contains only 3 classes (ProtoTypeAdapter, ProtoTypeAdapter.EnumSerialization, ProtoTypeAdapter.Builder) which are all part of the same adapter implementation. In contrast, the com.google.gson package is a large, comprehensive JSON library with 30+ classes including core types (JsonObject, JsonArray, JsonElement), serialization interfaces (JsonSerializer, JsonDeserializer), configuration classes (Gson, GsonBuilder), and various utilities. The com.google.gson package has significantly more incoming dependencies from external code and is therefore less stable than the specialized protobuf adapter package. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle as the more specialized package depends on a less stable, more general-purpose package."
