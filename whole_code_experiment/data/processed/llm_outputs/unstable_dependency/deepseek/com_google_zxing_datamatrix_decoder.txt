"package": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package depends on com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.ReedSolomonDecoder, which is less stable. The dependent package has 5 classes (ReedSolomonException, GenericGF, GenericGFPoly, ReedSolomonEncoder, ReedSolomonDecoder) with no incoming dependencies from other packages, indicating high instability. The analyzed package has 6 classes with incoming dependencies from com.google.zxing.datamatrix.DataMatrixReader, making it more stable than the dependent package. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle."
