"justification": "The package depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode which has 22 classes (high incoming dependencies) and only depends on 3 classes from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.allocationcount, making it more stable. The analyzed package has 3 classes and depends on 8 classes from the model.bytecode package, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle by depending on a more stable component."
