{
"package": "org.gradle.work",
"detection": false,
"justification": "Package org.gradle.work has outgoing dependencies to org.gradle.api.provider.Provider and org.gradle.api.file.Directory, which are part of the Gradle API. These dependencies are likely more stable than the Byte Buddy plugin package (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle) which depends on org.gradle.work. The Byte Buddy plugin package has extensive incoming dependencies from its own subpackages and is less stable due to its plugin nature and frequent changes. Therefore, org.gradle.work does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle as it depends on more stable Gradle API packages."
