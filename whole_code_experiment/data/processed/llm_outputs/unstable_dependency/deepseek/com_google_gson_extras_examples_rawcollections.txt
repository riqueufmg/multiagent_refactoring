  "justification": "The package depends on com.google.gson package which is a stable, widely-used library with many incoming dependencies. The com.google.gson package has numerous classes and is a core library, indicating high stability. The analyzed package is a simple example utility with minimal functionality and likely has few or no incoming dependencies, making it less stable than the com.google.gson package it depends on. Therefore, the dependency direction is from less stable to more stable, which follows the Stable Dependencies Principle."
