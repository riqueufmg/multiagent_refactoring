"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package depends on less stable packages. It has outgoing dependencies to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (contains many concrete classes like Compilation, CompilerThread, IMetaMember, etc.) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (contains JITWatchUI, which is a large UI class with many dependencies). These dependent packages are less stable because they contain many concrete implementations and are likely to change frequently. The analyzed package has no incoming dependencies, making it highly stable (stability = 1), while its dependencies have lower stability due to their own incoming dependencies. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle where a stable package should not depend on less stable packages."
