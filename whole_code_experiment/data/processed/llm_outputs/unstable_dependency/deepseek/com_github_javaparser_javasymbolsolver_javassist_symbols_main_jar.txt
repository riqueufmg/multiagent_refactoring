    "justification": "The package has outgoing dependencies to packages 'com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.included_jar' and 'com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.excluded_jar', but no incoming dependencies from those packages are shown. Without data on the stability (incoming and outgoing dependencies) of the depended-upon packages, it cannot be determined if they are less stable than the current package. Therefore, an Unstable Dependency smell cannot be confirmed."
