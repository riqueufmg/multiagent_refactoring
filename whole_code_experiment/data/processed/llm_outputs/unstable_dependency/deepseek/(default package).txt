"package": "(default package)",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The default package depends on com.github.javaparser.quality (Preconditions) and com.packageName (ClassInPackage, InnerStaticClassFieldContainer). These external packages have no incoming dependencies from the default package, making them more stable (lower instability). The default package has high outgoing dependencies and low incoming dependencies, making it less stable. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle as the less stable default package depends on more stable external packages."
