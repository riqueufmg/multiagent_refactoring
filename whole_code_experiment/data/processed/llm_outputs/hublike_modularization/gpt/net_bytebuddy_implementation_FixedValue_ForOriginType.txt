    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.ForOriginType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ForOriginType is a small inner class of FixedValue with a limited set of dependencies: it extends FixedValue (which brings Assigner and Assigner.Typing), implements AssignerConfigurable, and its appender uses TypeDescription (originType) and ClassConstant to produce a ByteCodeAppender. The direct collaborators visible in the snippet are a handful of types (Assigner, Assigner.Typing, TypeDescription, ClassConstant, ByteCodeAppender, MethodVisitor/Context/MethodDescription/StackManipulation). There is no evidence in the provided relationships of many incoming references to ForOriginType or dozens of outgoing dependencies to diverse abstractions. Therefore it does not act as a hub with large numbers of incoming and outgoing dependencies and does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
