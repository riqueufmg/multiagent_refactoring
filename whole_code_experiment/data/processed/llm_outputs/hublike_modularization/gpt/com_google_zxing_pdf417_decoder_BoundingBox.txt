    "justification": "BoundingBox serves as a central/shared abstraction used by many classes (high incoming coupling) while also depending on several other abstractions (outgoing coupling). Incoming dependencies: PDF417ScanningDecoder (instantiates BoundingBox, calls BoundingBox.merge and uses bounding box getters during detection and adjustment), DetectionResult (stores and passes BoundingBox, uses getBoundingBox/adds/sets it), DetectionResultColumn (constructor copies BoundingBox, uses getMinY/getMaxY/getMaxX/getMinX and imageRowToCodewordIndex offsets), DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn (constructed with BoundingBox and calls getTopLeft/getBottomLeft/getTopRight/getBottomRight and getRowHeights/adjust methods), and other decoder components that access BoundingBox getters (getMinX/getMaxX/getMinY/getMaxY and addMissingRows). Outgoing dependencies: BoundingBox directly depends on BitMatrix (holds image and calls getWidth/getHeight), ResultPoint (stores corner points and calls getX/getY), and NotFoundException (constructor throws when both sides unspecified). The class exposes many getters and mutating helpers (merge, addMissingRows) that are heavily used across the decoder, making it a hub connecting multiple modules. This concentration of both many clients and key external dependencies matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
