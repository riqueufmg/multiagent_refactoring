    "class": "org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator.Not",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Not inner class has only a few direct dependencies: it extends StructuralEvaluator (inheritance), stores a single Evaluator reference (constructor super(evaluator)), and delegates to that evaluator via memoMatches(root, node) and evaluator.cost() / evaluator.toString(). Its implementations are limited to evaluateMatch (calls memoMatches and negates evaluator.matches), cost (returns 2 + evaluator.cost()), and toString. It does not reference or depend on a large number of other abstractions (no broad incoming/outgoing dependency graph), so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
