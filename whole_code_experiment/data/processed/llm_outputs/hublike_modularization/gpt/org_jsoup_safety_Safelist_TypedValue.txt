    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Safelist.TypedValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypedValue is a small, focused base class used by four closely related nested types (TagName, AttributeKey, AttributeValue, Protocol). Its incoming dependencies are limited to those four subclasses, and its outgoing dependencies are minimal (Validate.notNull in the constructor and Objects.equals in equals). It does not have incoming/outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions or modules, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
