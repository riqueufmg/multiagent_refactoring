    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.FormattingError",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FormattingError has only a small number of dependencies: it references FormatterDiagnostic (stores an ImmutableList<FormatterDiagnostic>) and uses Guava utilities (Joiner, ImmutableList). FormatterDiagnostic itself has minimal dependencies. There is no evidence of this abstraction having incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (only a single domain class relation is present), so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
