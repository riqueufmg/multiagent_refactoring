    "justification": "MethodNameEqualityResolver is a small, focused enum implementing AmbiguityResolver with only a few direct dependencies: MethodDescription (source parameter), MethodDelegationBinder.MethodBinding (left/right parameters) and AmbiguityResolver.Resolution (return values). Its implementation only calls left.getTarget().getName(), right.getTarget().getName(), source.getName() and compares names to choose LEFT/RIGHT/AMBIGUOUS. It does not reference or aggregate a large number of other abstractions nor act as a central connector for many modules; therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
