    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeParameterMetaModel has very limited direct dependencies: it extends ReferenceTypeMetaModel and declares two PropertyMetaModel fields (namePropertyMetaModel, typeBoundPropertyMetaModel) and uses Optional<BaseNodeMetaModel> in its constructor. It does not reference a large number of other abstractions. Incoming references are few and expected (e.g. JavaParserMetaModel registers a single typeParameterMetaModel instance and a small number of meta-models reference it for typeParameters: callableDeclarationMetaModel, classOrInterfaceDeclarationMetaModel, recordDeclarationMetaModel, compactConstructorDeclarationMetaModel). There is no evidence in the provided code of many incoming and outgoing dependencies that would make this class a hub."
