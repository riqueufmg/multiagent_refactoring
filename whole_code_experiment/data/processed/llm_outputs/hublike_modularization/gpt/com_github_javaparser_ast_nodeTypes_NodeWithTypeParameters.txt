    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The interface has only a small, focused set of outgoing dependencies in the provided code: the generic bound N extends Node, the NodeList<TypeParameter> return type, the TypeParameter element type, and a single use of StaticJavaParser.parseTypeParameter in the default addTypeParameter(String) method. Incoming references in the given snippets are limited (for example JavaParserTypeDeclarationAdapter performs an instanceof NodeWithTypeParameters and iterates its getTypeParameters()). There is no evidence in the provided excerpts of dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many implementers or many distinct callers), so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell based on the given code."
