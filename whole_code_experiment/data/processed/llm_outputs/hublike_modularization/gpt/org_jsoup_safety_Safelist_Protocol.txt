    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Safelist acts as a central hub in the API: it exposes many public factory/configuration methods (none, simpleText, basic, basicWithImages, relaxed, addTags, addAttributes, addEnforcedAttribute, addProtocols, removeTags, removeAttributes, removeEnforcedAttribute, removeProtocols, preserveRelativeLinks, isSafeTag, isSafeAttribute, getEnforcedAttributes) and maintains multiple cross-cutting maps (tagNames, attributes, enforcedAttributes, protocols) that relate TagName -> AttributeKey/AttributeValue/Protocol for many different tag/attribute combinations. It depends on and manipulates several external abstractions (org.jsoup.nodes.Element, Attribute, Attributes; org.jsoup.helper.Validate; org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer) and defines multiple nested typed classes (TagName, AttributeKey, AttributeValue, Protocol, TypedValue) to mediate those relations. The class is referenced as a central configuration point in the javadoc examples (Jsoup.clean(..., Safelist) and Cleaner(Safelist.none())), indicating many incoming usages. Together these responsibilities and broad interactions (many tag/attribute/protocol entries, many public mutation/query methods, both external dependencies and many clients) match the Hub-like Modularization smell."
