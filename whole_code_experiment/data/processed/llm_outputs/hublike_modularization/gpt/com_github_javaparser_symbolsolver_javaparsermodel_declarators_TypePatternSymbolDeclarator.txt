    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypePatternSymbolDeclarator has only a small number of dependencies (TypePatternExpr, TypeSolver, ResolvedValueDeclaration, JavaParserSymbolDeclaration, and standard List/LinkedList). Its getSymbolDeclarations() method simply creates a single JavaParserSymbolDeclaration.patternVar(...) and returns it, delegating work rather than coupling to many abstractions. There is no evidence in the provided code of numerous incoming or outgoing dependencies that would make it a hub."
