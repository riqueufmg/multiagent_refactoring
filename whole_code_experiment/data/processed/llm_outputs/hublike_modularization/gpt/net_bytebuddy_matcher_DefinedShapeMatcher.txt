    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DefinedShapeMatcher has a very small, focused set of dependencies: it extends ElementMatcher.Junction.ForNonNullValues (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and is parameterized by ByteCodeElement.TypeDependant (net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement). It holds a single ElementMatcher<? super S> field and simply delegates doMatch to matcher.matches(target.asDefined()). The only other referenced type is the annotation HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin.Enhance (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), which is an annotation and does not indicate broad coupling. There are no incoming/outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions in the provided context, so this class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
