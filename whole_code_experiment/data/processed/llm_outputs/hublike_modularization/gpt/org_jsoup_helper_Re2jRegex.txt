    "justification": "Re2jRegex has a small, focused set of dependencies: it extends org.jsoup.helper.Regex, uses com.google.re2j.Pattern and com.google.re2j.Matcher (via its inner Re2jMatcher), references java.util.regex.Pattern only for a dummy field, and throws ValidationException on compile errors. Incoming references are limited (Regex.compile calls Re2jRegex.compile). There is not a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
