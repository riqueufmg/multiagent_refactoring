    "justification": "IOStream acts as a central hub: it directly depends on a large number of other abstractions (outgoing dependencies) and is referenced by many package classes (incoming dependencies). Outgoing dependencies in the IOStream source include java.util.stream.Stream, Spliterator, StreamSupport, Collector, DoubleStream, IntStream, LongStream, Optional, Arrays, Iterator, List/ArrayList, NoSuchElementException, AtomicInteger/AtomicReference, BiFunction, IntFunction, ToDoubleFunction/ToIntFunction/ToLongFunction, UnaryOperator and many package-level functional interfaces and helpers (IOUnaryOperator, IOPredicate, IOFunction, IOSupplier, IOBiConsumer, IOConsumer, IOBinaryOperator, IOComparator, Erase, IOStreams, IOStreamAdapter). Incoming dependencies / usages include IOStreamAdapter.adapt and IOStreamAdapter implementing IOStream, IOStreams.forAll calling IOStream.adapt, IOConsumer.forAll and IOStreams.forEach utilities that route through IOStream, and method signatures that accept/return IOStream (for example IOFunction used by flatMap returning IOStream). The multiplicity of both incoming and outgoing relationships demonstrates a hub-like modularization smell."
