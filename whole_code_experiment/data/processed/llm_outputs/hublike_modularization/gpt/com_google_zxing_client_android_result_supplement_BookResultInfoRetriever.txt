    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement.BookResultInfoRetriever",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although BookResultInfoRetriever depends on several collaborators (HttpHelper, LocaleManager, HistoryManager, Context/TextView, Android R resources, and JSON classes) these are expected, focused dependencies for its responsibility (fetching and parsing book info). It extends SupplementalInfoRetriever and is instantiated from SupplementalInfoRetriever.maybeInvokeRetrieval (incoming dependency), but there are no many incoming callers beyond that factory use. The class is cohesive (network call, JSON parsing, formatting, and appending results) and does not have unusually large numbers of incoming and outgoing connections to disparate modules that would make it a hub. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
