    "justification": "ViewerAssembly both depends on — and is the integration point for — a large number of other abstractions. Outgoing dependencies (references/imports and calls) include: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyMethod, AssemblyBlock, AssemblyInstruction, AssemblyReference, AssemblyUtil, IAssemblyParser, Architecture, AssemblyParserARM, AssemblyParserX86, X86RegisterType, ARMRegisterType, ARMShifter, ARMExtend, AssemblyLabel, AssemblyInstruction methods (getCommentLines, getMnemonic, isSafePoint, getOperands, toString), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction, and utility StringUtil; it also depends on JavaFX types (Label, Tooltip, Node) and formatting classes (DecimalFormat/NumberFormat). Incoming dependencies (uses of ViewerAssembly as a viewer/UI component and its role extending Viewer) make it a central UI hub. Because it coordinates many model, parser, and UI abstractions (numerous distinct classes/packages) it exhibits Hub-like Modularization: high fan-in and fan-out, indicating a single class integrating many responsibilities and acting as a coupling hotspot."
