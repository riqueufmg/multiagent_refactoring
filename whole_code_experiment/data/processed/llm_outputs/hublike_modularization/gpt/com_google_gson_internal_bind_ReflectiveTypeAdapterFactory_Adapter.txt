    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Adapter class is a central connector between many distinct subsystems, showing hub-like modularization. Outgoing dependencies in the code include: reflection utilities and types (ReflectionHelper, ReflectionAccessFilterHelper, BoundField, FieldsData, java.lang.reflect.Field/Method/Constructor, AccessibleObject, Member), streaming I/O (com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader, JsonWriter, JsonToken), Gson core types and exceptions (Gson, TypeAdapter, TypeToken, JsonIOException, JsonParseException, JsonSyntaxException), object construction helpers (ObjectConstructor, ConstructorConstructor), and collections (Map, List). Incoming/usage relationships include its concrete subclasses FieldReflectionAdapter and RecordAdapter and external use (note in comment: \"external projects check for this class with `instanceof`\"). Because it both depends on and is relied upon by many different abstractions across reflection, streaming, construction, and error-handling concerns, it functions as a hub linking multiple modules, which matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
