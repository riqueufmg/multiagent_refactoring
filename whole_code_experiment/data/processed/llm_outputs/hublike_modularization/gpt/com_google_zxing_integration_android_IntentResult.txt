    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IntentResult is a simple immutable data holder with only a few fields of basic types (String, byte[], Integer) and simple getter methods and toString. It has no imports or references to many other abstractions and is only used as the return value from IntentIntegrator.parseActivityResult. There are no incoming/outgoing dependencies with a large number of other classes, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
