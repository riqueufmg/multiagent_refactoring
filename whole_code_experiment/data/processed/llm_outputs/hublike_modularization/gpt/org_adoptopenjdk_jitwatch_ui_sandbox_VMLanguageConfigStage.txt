    "detection": false,
    "justification": "VMLanguageConfigStage has a small, focused set of dependencies: it holds a JITWatchConfig, calls UserInterfaceUtil.getScene, uses the IStageClosedListener interface and JavaFX UI classes (TextField, Button, DirectoryChooser, Stage, etc.). Incoming usage is limited (constructed from VMLanguageList and shown via StageManager). It does not have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions across the codebase, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
