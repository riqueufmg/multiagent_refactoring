    "detection": false,
    "justification": "False. The LazyParameterDescription is a small, highly-local inner class whose dependencies are narrow and cohesive: it references its enclosing LazyMethodDescription (declaring method), parameter metadata arrays (names, modifiers), the method signature resolution (GenericTypeToken.Resolution.ForMethod / signatureResolution) to resolve parameter types, the TypePool for deferred lookups, and annotation-related types (AnnotationList / AnnotationValue). These dependencies are all closely related (method/parameter/type/annotation handling) and are primarily internal to the TypePool / TypeDescription / MethodDescription domain rather than a large number of unrelated abstractions. There is no evidence of many incoming/outgoing dependencies across many distinct modules or packages that would indicate a hub-like modularization smell."
