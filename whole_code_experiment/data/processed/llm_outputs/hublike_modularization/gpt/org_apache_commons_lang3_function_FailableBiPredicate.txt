    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBiPredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FailableBiPredicate does not act as a hub: it has only a small set of outgoing dependencies (uses java.util.Objects for null checks and references java.util.function.BiPredicate in javadoc) and primarily refers to its own type in default/static methods (and, or, negate, FALSE/TRUE singletons, falsePredicate/truePredicate). Incoming usage is limited (for example, Failable.test and Failable.asBiPredicate convert/use FailableBiPredicate), but there are not a large number of distinct incoming and outgoing dependencies across many other abstractions. Therefore it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
