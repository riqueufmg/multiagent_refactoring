    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter.AssignerConfigurable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The interface only has a small number of dependencies: it extends Implementation.Composable and declares a single method withAssigner(Assigner). Outgoing dependencies are therefore limited to Implementation.Composable and Assigner. Incoming references are local: InvocationHandlerAdapter declares/uses this nested interface and WithoutPrivilegeConfiguration extends it. There is no large set of incoming/outgoing relationships to many other abstractions, so it is not a hub-like module."
