    "justification": "DirectorySupplier is a minimal inner adapter that implements Supplier<Directory> by delegating to FileFactory.createDirectory(). Its dependencies are limited to the enclosing FileFactory and the Directory/Supplier types (and the createDirectory() method); it does not have incoming/outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
