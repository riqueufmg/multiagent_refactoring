    "detection": true,
    "justification": "This class is acting as a hub: it has incoming and outgoing dependencies on many distinct abstractions across the lexical-preservation and concrete-syntax-model domains. It directly uses NodeText and TextElement to read node text, CsmMix, CsmElement and CsmToken to navigate the concrete syntax model, Difference.ArrayIterator/PeekingIterator for iteration, DifferenceElement and its variants (Reshuffled, Added, Kept, Removed) to manipulate diff elements, and DifferenceElementCalculator.matching to detect correspondences. In addition it constructs and maps between these types (maps between next/previous CSM indexes, builds lists of CsmElement to add, translates node-text indices to CSM indices). The large number of distinct domain types it depends on (NodeText, TextElement, CsmMix, CsmElement, CsmToken, Difference.ArrayIterator, PeekingIterator, DifferenceElement, Reshuffled, Added, Kept, Removed, DifferenceElementCalculator, etc.) and its coordinating role indicate a Hub-like Modularization smell."
