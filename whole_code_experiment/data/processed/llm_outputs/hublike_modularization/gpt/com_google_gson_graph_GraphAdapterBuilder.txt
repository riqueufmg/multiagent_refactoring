    "detection": true,
    "justification": "GraphAdapterBuilder has hub-like modularization. It directly depends on a large number of distinct abstractions across several packages and also exposes/mediates connections between them: e.g. com.google.gson.Gson and com.google.gson.GsonBuilder (registerOn uses gsonBuilder.registerTypeAdapterFactory(factory) and gsonBuilder.registerTypeAdapter(...)), com.google.gson.InstanceCreator and com.google.gson.TypeAdapterFactory (Factory implements InstanceCreator<Object> and TypeAdapterFactory), com.google.gson.TypeAdapter and com.google.gson.JsonElement (Factory.create obtains delegate TypeAdapter<T> and elementAdapter), com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken and com.google.gson.internal.ConstructorConstructor/ObjectConstructor (addType uses constructorConstructor.get(TypeToken.get(type)) and creates an InstanceCreator using ObjectConstructor.construct()), com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader/JsonWriter/JsonToken (read/write logic in the TypeAdapter returned by Factory), and many java.util collections and maps (IdentityHashMap, HashMap, ArrayDeque, Queue, Map, Entry). The nested Factory/Graph/Element classes also mediate between Gson internals and registered instance creators (graphThreadLocal, graph.map, graph.queue, nextCreate), making this class a central connector that has both incoming and outgoing dependencies to many other abstractions (Gson/GsonBuilder, TypeAdapter/TypeAdapterFactory, InstanceCreator, ConstructorConstructor/ObjectConstructor, TypeToken, JsonElement/JsonReader/JsonWriter, and collection classes). These numerous cross-package dependencies and its role in registering/adapting adapters indicate a hub-like modularization smell."
