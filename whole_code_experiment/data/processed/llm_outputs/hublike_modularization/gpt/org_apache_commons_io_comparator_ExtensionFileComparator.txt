    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.ExtensionFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ExtensionFileComparator has a small, focused set of dependencies: it extends AbstractFileComparator, implements Serializable and Comparator, and uses FilenameUtils (FilenameUtils.getExtension(...)) and IOCase (field ioCase and IOCase.value / ioCase.checkCompareTo) plus ReverseFileComparator for reverse singletons. The class interacts with a handful of abstractions (IOCase, FilenameUtils, ReverseFileComparator, AbstractFileComparator, File, Serializable, Comparator) rather than a large number. There is no evidence in the provided code of many incoming dependents or an unusually high fan-in/fan-out; its responsibilities are cohesive (comparing file extensions). Therefore it does not meet the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
