    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.AbstractFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only a small number of outgoing dependencies (java.io.File, java.util.Arrays, java.util.Comparator, java.util.List) and implements a narrow API (two sort variants and toString). There are no fields, no extensive collaboration with many other abstractions, and no evidence in this file of a large number of incoming dependencies. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
