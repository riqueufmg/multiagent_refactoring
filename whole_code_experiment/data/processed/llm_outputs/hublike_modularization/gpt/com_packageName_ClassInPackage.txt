    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ClassInPackage does not exhibit hub-like modularization: it defines a single staticMethod and is referenced directly only once (PackageDotExpressions calls com.packageName.ClassInPackage.staticMethod()). The numerous references in PackageDotExpressions target other types (InnerClassContainer, InnerClass, InnerInnerClass, etc.), not ClassInPackage, so there is no evidence of many incoming and outgoing dependencies for ClassInPackage."
