    "class": "(default package).InnerClassDotExpressions.InnerClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed abstraction participates only in a small, hierarchical set of relations: it is defined inside InnerClassContainer, contains nested InnerInnerClass (and InnerInnerInnerClass), and is referenced by InnerClassDotExpressions.main via a few static method calls. These are a simple nesting chain and a few incoming calls, not a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies across many different abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
