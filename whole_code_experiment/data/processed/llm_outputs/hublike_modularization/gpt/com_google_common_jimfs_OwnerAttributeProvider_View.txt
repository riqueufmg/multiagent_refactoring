    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.OwnerAttributeProvider.View",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The View class has only a small, focused set of dependencies and does not act as a hub. It extends AbstractAttributeView and implements FileOwnerAttributeView, and its constructor and methods reference FileLookup and File via lookupFile(). The only external types used are FileLookup, File, UserPrincipal, AbstractAttributeView, and FileOwnerAttributeView (see constructor View(FileLookup), methods getOwner() and setOwner() which call lookupFile().getAttribute(...) / setAttribute(...), and name()). There are no many incoming/outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
