    "class": "implements_duplicate.A.DuplicateTypeName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The type has only mutual dependencies with its enclosing class A: DuplicateTypeName extends A (outgoing dependency) and A implements DuplicateTypeName (incoming dependency). There are no many incoming/outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so this does not constitute Hub-like Modularization."
