    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.MethodConstant.CachedConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CachedConstructor has a small, focused set of outgoing dependencies (FieldAccess, Implementation.Context.cache, TypeDescription.ForLoadedType.of(Constructor.class), StackManipulation) and only a few known incoming uses (constructed by ForConstructor.cached() and by PrivilegedLookup.cached()). The class only wraps a StackManipulation and delegates to FieldAccess.forField(...).read().apply(...), so it does not interact with a large number of other abstractions and therefore does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
