    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AttributeNameHistoWalker has only a small number of dependencies: it extends AbstractHistoVisitable and takes an IReadOnlyJITDataModel in its constructor, and its visit method depends on IMetaMember (calling getCompiledAttribute/getQueuedAttribute). It does not have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of distinct abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. (While IMetaMember itself references many types, the analyzed class does not.)"
