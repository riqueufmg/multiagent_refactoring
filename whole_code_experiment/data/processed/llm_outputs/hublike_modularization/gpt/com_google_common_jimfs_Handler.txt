    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Handler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only a small, focused set of dependencies: it extends java.net.URLStreamHandler and uses java.net.URL, java.net.URLConnection, java.net.InetAddress, java.io.IOException, java.lang.System (system properties), com.google.common.base.Preconditions (checkArgument), and an internal PathURLConnection. It provides a narrow responsibility (URL handler registration and minimal URL behavior) and interacts with a handful of classes rather than a large number of unrelated abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
