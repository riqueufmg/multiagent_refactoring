    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The TypeWriter abstraction (and its nested classes such as WithActiveRecord) acts as a central hub: it both depends on and is used by a large number of other abstractions across the code base. Evidence of many outgoing dependencies: the code references/uses org.objectweb.asm visitors (ClassVisitor, MethodVisitor, FieldVisitor, RecordComponentVisitor, ModuleVisitor), ASM helpers (ClassReader, ClassWriter, Remapper/SimpleRemapper), bytecode/implementation primitives (ByteCodeAppender, StackManipulation, MethodInvocation, MethodReturn, MethodVariableAccess, FieldAccess), implementation framework types (Implementation, Implementation.Context, Implementation.Context.ExtractableView, MethodRebaseResolver, RebaseImplementationTarget, SubclassImplementationTarget), type descriptions and pools (TypeDescription, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, RecordComponentDescription, TypePool), attribute & annotation helpers (AnnotationValueFilter.Factory, AnnotationRetention, TypeAttributeAppender, FieldAttributeAppender, MethodAttributeAppender, RecordComponentAttributeAppender), auxiliary type support (AuxiliaryType, AuxiliaryType.NamingStrategy), class file/version utilities (ClassFileVersion, TypeInitializer, LoadedTypeInitializer), and utility classes (AsmClassReader.Factory, AsmClassWriter.Factory, ClassFileLocator). Evidence of many incoming dependencies / many other components relying on TypeWriter and its nested records: Implementation.Context.Default defines DelegationRecord types that extend TypeWriter.MethodPool.Record.ForDefinedMethod and calls record.apply(...); Implementation.Context.drain and TypeWriter.Default.UnresolvedType.toDynamicType return/consume TypeWriter-related data; MethodRegistry, MethodPool, FieldPool and RecordComponentPool are integrated throughout Default/ForCreation/ForInlining/WithFullProcessing where TypeWriter records (FieldPool.Record, MethodPool.Record, RecordComponentPool.Record) are created, applied and wrapped (e.g., AccessBridgeWrapper wraps MethodPool.Record). The sheer volume of distinct collaborators (ASM, implementation, description, attribute, auxiliary and utility subsystems) indicates the analyzed abstraction functions as a hub with many incoming and outgoing dependencies, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
