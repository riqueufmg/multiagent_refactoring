    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableDoublePredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The interface has only a small number of dependencies: java.util.Objects (used for null checks) and a javadoc reference to java.util.function.DoublePredicate. Its methods operate on the same abstraction (FailableDoublePredicate) and primitive double; composition methods (and, or, negate) reference only the interface itself. There are no signs of many incoming/outgoing dependencies to a large set of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
