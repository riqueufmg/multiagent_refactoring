    "justification": "AsmClassReader acts as a central hub: it directly depends on many different abstractions (outgoing deps) — e.g. org.objectweb.asm.Attribute, org.objectweb.asm.ClassReader, org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, net.bytebuddy.utility.privilege.GetSystemPropertyAction, java.security.PrivilegedAction and standard collections/arrays — and provides multiple factory/implementation variants that branch to other components (Factory.Default enum referencing OpenedClassReader, AsmClassWriter.Factory.Default choices, ASM_ONLY/CLASS_FILE_API_ONLY, and use of ForClassFileApi.DISPATCHER interacting with codes.rafael.asmjdkbridge.JdkClassReader). It also has many incoming uses in the analyzed code: OpenedClassReader implements AsmClassReader.Factory and returns ForAsm instances; other classes (e.g. AccessControllerPlugin and ClassFileVersion) reference OpenedClassReader.ASM_API or use AsmClassReader.Factory behavior. The interface plus its inner implementations and factory selection logic create numerous incoming and outgoing links, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
