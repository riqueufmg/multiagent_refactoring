    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableRunnable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FailableRunnable is a small functional interface (single method void run() throws E) that is referenced by several utilities (incoming dependencies) such as org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable (methods asRunnable, run, tryWithResources), org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch (runT), and org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationUtils (of). However, it has minimal outgoing dependencies: only the Throwable type via its throws E signature. Because it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions itself (only Throwable) even though it is used by multiple classes, it does not meet the definition of Hub-like Modularization (which requires many incoming and many outgoing dependencies)."
