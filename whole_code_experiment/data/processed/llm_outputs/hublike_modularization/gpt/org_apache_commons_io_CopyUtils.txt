    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.CopyUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CopyUtils is a small, deprecated utility facade that delegates to IOUtils and to standard JDK stream/reader/writer classes. Its outgoing dependencies are limited and expected for a copy helper (InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer, String, byte[], Charset, ByteArrayInputStream, StringReader, InputStreamReader, OutputStreamWriter, and a couple of IOUtils helpers such as IOUtils.byteArray() and IOUtils.ScratchChars). The class implementations are thin (e.g. output.write(input), creating InputStreamReader/OutputStreamWriter and calling copy(...), or delegating to IOUtils buffers), not coordinating many unrelated modules. The provided dependency listing shows IOUtils as a large utility with many responsibilities (the actual hub), but there is no evidence in the inputs of CopyUtils having a large number of incoming dependencies or acting as a central hub. Therefore CopyUtils does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
