    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.CollectionTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Adapter<E> inner class has a focused, small set of dependencies: TypeAdapter<E> (elementTypeAdapter), ObjectConstructor<? extends Collection<E>> (constructor), JsonReader, JsonWriter, JsonToken, java.util.Collection, and IOException. Its responsibilities are narrowly scoped to reading/writing collection elements and constructing collection instances. There is no evidence it has incoming/outgoing dependencies with a large number of unrelated abstractions or acts as a central hub; coupling is limited and cohesive, so this is not a Hub-like Modularization smell."
