    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NamingStrategy.AbstractBase has a small, focused set of relationships: outgoing dependencies are limited to TypeDescription / TypeDescription.Generic (used in subclass(...) and the abstract name(TypeDescription) contract), and incoming dependencies are its concrete subclasses within the same file (Suffixing, SuffixingRandom, PrefixingRandom). There are no many disparate incoming/outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions, so it is not a hub-like module."
