    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Code128Reader has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (uses BarcodeFormat, ChecksumException, DecodeHintType, FormatException, NotFoundException, Result, ResultMetadataType, ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, OneDReader and standard collections/types) as expected for a decoder, but it does not act as a central hub: incoming dependencies are minimal in the provided codebase (notably Code128Writer references Code128Reader.CODE_PATTERNS). There is no evidence of a large number of other abstractions both depending on and being depended upon by Code128Reader, so it does not meet the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
