    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ExceptionContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ExceptionContext has only a small set of dependencies (java.util.List, java.util.Set, org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple.Pair, String, Object) and a few known implementers/clients in the provided code (ContextedException, ContextedRuntimeException and DefaultExceptionContext instantiated in their constructors). The two exception classes merely delegate to an ExceptionContext field (exceptionContext) and instantiate DefaultExceptionContext when null; there is no evidence of incoming/outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions that would indicate a hub-like module."
