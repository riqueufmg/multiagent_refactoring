    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AutoFocusManager has only a small set of outgoing dependencies (android.content.Context, SharedPreferences/PreferenceManager, android.hardware.Camera and Camera.Parameters, android.os.AsyncTask, android.util.Log, java.util collections and concurrency classes, and PreferencesActivity for the KEY_AUTO_FOCUS). Incoming usage is limited (CameraManager constructs and calls start()/stop() and setTorch temporarily replaces it). There is not a large number of distinct abstractions both depending on AutoFocusManager and depended upon by it — interactions are focused on the camera subsystem and a single manager class — so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
