    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddy_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has many outgoing dependencies (imports and direct uses) on JMH and utility abstractions: InfraControl, ThreadParams, BenchmarkParams, IterationParams, Blackhole, Control, RawResults, SampleBuffer, BenchmarkTaskResult and multiple Result subclasses (ThroughputResult, AverageTimeResult, SampleTimeResult, SingleShotResult), plus java.util and reflection types. However, there is no evidence in the provided code of a large number of incoming dependencies (few or no other abstractions reference this class in the snippet). Because the Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies, this class does not meet the full criterion based on the available code."
