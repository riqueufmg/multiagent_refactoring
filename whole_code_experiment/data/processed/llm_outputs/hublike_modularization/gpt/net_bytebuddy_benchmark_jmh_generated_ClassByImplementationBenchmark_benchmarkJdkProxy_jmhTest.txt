    "detection": true,
    "justification": "This generated JMH test class depends on a large number of distinct abstractions from the JMH framework and Java standard library, and acts as the connector between the benchmark implementation and the JMH infrastructure. Outgoing dependencies include: InfraControl, ThreadParams, BenchmarkParams, IterationParams, Blackhole, Control, RawResults, BenchmarkTaskResult, ThroughputResult, AverageTimeResult, SampleTimeResult, SingleShotResult, SampleBuffer, ResultRole, FailureAssistException, and standard types such as TimeUnit, List/Collection/ArrayList. It also invokes the benchmark type ClassByImplementationBenchmark_jmhType. As a generated harness (jmh_generated) it is intended to be invoked by the JMH runner (incoming dependency) while orchestrating many framework/result/control classes (outgoing dependencies). The number and diversity of these incoming/outgoing interactions indicate a hub-like modularization smell."
