    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The UnusedImportScanner (and its enclosing RemoveUnusedImports class) has outgoing and incoming dependencies on a large number of distinct abstractions: compiler/internal AST types (JavacTrees, JCCompilationUnit, JCTree, JCImport, JCFieldAccess, DCTree/DCReference, DocCommentTree, ReferenceTree, IdentifierTree, CaseTree, ImportTree, Tree, TreeScanner, TreePathScanner, DocTreePathScanner, DocTreePath), reflection/compat helpers (Method, GET_QUALIFIED_IDENTIFIER_METHOD, IS_MODULE_METHOD, reflective invocation of getQualifiedIdentifier and isModule), utility/context classes (Context, Diagnostic, JavaFileObject), collection and range utilities from Guava (Multimap, HashMultimap, Range, RangeMap, RangeSet, TreeRangeMap, TreeRangeSet), and other utilities (CharMatcher, Newlines, Trees, FormatterException). The scanner's logic traverses many AST node types, scans javadoc references, and uses reflection to adapt to multiple API versions, showing coupling to many modules. This breadth of both incoming (used by various AST structures and tooling) and outgoing (depending on many external types and utility libraries) relationships indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
