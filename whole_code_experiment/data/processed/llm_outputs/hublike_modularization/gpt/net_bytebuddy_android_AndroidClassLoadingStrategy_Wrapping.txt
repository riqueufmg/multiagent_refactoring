    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Wrapping class is small and focused: it declares two constructors and a single protected doLoad(...) implementation. Its outgoing dependencies are limited and explicit (DexClassLoader, File, TypeDescription, Class.forName, Map/HashMap and standard I/O/exception types). It does not declare many collaborators or a large API surface nor does it aggregate or delegate to a large number of other abstractions. While its enclosing AndroidClassLoadingStrategy contains many nested types and dependencies, Wrapping itself is lightweight and not acting as a central hub connecting a large number of other abstractions."
