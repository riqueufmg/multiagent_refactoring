    "justification": "DecodeServlet acts as a central hub connecting many unrelated abstractions: it directly depends on numerous classes from the barcode library (MultiFormatReader, GenericMultipleBarcodeReader, Reader, MultipleBarcodeReader, BinaryBitmap, Binarizers GlobalHistogramBinarizer/HybridBinarizer, LuminanceSource/BufferedImageLuminanceSource, Result, DecodeHintType, NotFoundException, ReaderException, Result metadata classes), on image/IO helpers (com.google.zxing.client.j2se.ImageReader, ImageIO), on web and servlet APIs (HttpServlet, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, ServletConfig, ServletContext, RequestDispatcher, Part), on networking/HTTP (HttpURLConnection, URL, URI), on utility libraries (com.google.common.io.Resources, HttpHeaders, MediaType), and its own DoSTracker and timer logic. It performs orchestration for lifecycle/init (init/destroy), request handling (doGet/doPost), image fetching/validation, decoding flows, error handling (errorResponse using ResourceBundle and RequestDispatcher) and rate-tracking (DoSTracker). It therefore has many outgoing dependencies across multiple packages and acts as the single coordinator between web layer, network I/O, image reading, decoding algorithms and tracking — exhibiting hub-like modularization."
