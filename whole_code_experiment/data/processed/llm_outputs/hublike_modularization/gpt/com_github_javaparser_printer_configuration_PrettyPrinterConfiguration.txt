    "detection": true,
    "justification": "PrettyPrinterConfiguration acts as a central wrapper connecting many configuration abstractions and is referenced by multiple printer classes. Outgoing dependencies: it directly depends on PrinterConfiguration (field wrappedConfiguration and implemented API), DefaultPrinterConfiguration (instantiated in the default ctor), DefaultConfigurationOption / DefaultPrinterConfiguration.ConfigOption (used throughout to access/set options), Indentation and Indentation.IndentType (getIndentation()/setIndentation() and related deprecated API), and ConfigurationOption (method signatures). Incoming dependencies: it is used by several classes in the printer package — PrettyPrintVisitor (has a protected PrettyPrinterConfiguration configuration and constructs SourcePrinter from it), PrettyPrinter (constructors, get/set configuration and visitorFactory), and SourcePrinter (constructor SourcePrinter(final PrettyPrinterConfiguration configuration)) — meaning many clients rely on it. Additionally it forwards many operations to the wrapped configuration (addOption, removeOption, isActivated, get, get()), increasing coupling. This mix of multiple incoming references from different modules (printer.* classes) and multiple outgoing references to many configuration abstractions matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
