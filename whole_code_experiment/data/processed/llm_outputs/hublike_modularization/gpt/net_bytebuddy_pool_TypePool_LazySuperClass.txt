    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazySuperClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class is a small, tightly scoped inner class with very few responsibilities and limited coupling. It defines a single field (internalName) and three simple methods: resolve() (delegates to delegate().getSuperClass()), getDeclaredAnnotations() (delegates to resolved generic), and asErasure() (creates a LazyTypeDescription for the internal name). Its outgoing dependencies are limited to the enclosing delegate (delegate()), LazyTypeDescription, Generic/AnnotationList related types and simple string manipulation. There are no signs of many incoming/outgoing dependencies across many abstractions (no large collections of collaborators, registries, or numerous external API usages). Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
