    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The code acts as a central hub connecting many disparate listener interfaces and event sources to arbitrary target methods. Evidence: (1) bindEventsToMethod uses a generic listenerType (<L>) and Proxy.newProxyInstance(new Class[] { listenerType }, new EventBindingInvocationHandler(...)) to create listeners for any listener interface, allowing connections to many different listener abstractions. (2) addEventListener invokes MethodUtils.invokeMethod(eventSource, \"add\" + listenerType.getSimpleName(), listener) via reflection, meaning EventUtils can attach listeners to many different event source classes (incoming dependencies on many event sources). (3) EventBindingInvocationHandler invokes target methods via MethodUtils.getAccessibleMethod and MethodUtils.invokeMethod, creating outgoing dependencies to arbitrary target classes/methods. (4) The handler references general reflection types (InvocationHandler, Method, Proxy) and uses dynamic sets of eventTypes, showing it mediates a wide range of interactions rather than a narrow, single-responsibility role. Together these points indicate hub-like modularization: the abstraction has incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
