    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ForLegacyAndroid acts as a central dispatcher that connects many different abstractions: it directly depends on Project, Variant, Configuration, FileCollection, TaskProvider, LegacyByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask, MultipleArtifact (MultipleArtifact.ALL_CLASSES_DIRS), and Kotlin Function1/Gradle provider types. It also defines inner function enums (GetLocalClassesFunction, GetOutputDirFunction) that expose ListProperty<Directory> and DirectoryProperty from the task, further coupling it to task APIs. Additionally, it is selected as the TRANSFORMATION_DISPATCHER fallback and is invoked from VariantAction.execute, making it a widely-used hub with many incoming and outgoing dependencies across the Gradle/Android plugin APIs and the plugin's task types."
