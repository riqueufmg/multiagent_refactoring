    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableObjLongConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The interface has only a few dependencies: an import/reference to java.util.function.ObjLongConsumer (in javadoc), the Throwable type via the generic E, and standard annotations (@FunctionalInterface, @SuppressWarnings). It declares a single method accept, a nop() factory and a NOP singleton. There is no evidence of incoming/outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; the coupling is minimal and single-purpose, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
