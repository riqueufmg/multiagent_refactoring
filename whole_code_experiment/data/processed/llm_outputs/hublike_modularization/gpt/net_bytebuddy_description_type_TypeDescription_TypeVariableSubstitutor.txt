    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.TypeVariableSubstitutor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed type is a small, focused inner class used by Generic.Visitor.Substitutor.ForTypeVariableBinding. Its implementation holds a single field of type Generic and defines two methods: onType(TypeDescription) and onMethod(MethodDescription.InDefinedShape). It interacts only with a very small set of abstractions (Generic, TypeDescription and MethodDescription) and is tightly scoped to substituting type variables. While the enclosing TypeDescription class has a very large dependency surface, this specific inner class does not have large numbers of incoming/outgoing dependencies and therefore does not qualify as a hub-like modularization."
