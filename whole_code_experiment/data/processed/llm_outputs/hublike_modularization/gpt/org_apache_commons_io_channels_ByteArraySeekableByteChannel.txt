    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ByteArraySeekableByteChannel has only a small, focused set of dependencies (java.io.ByteArrayInputStream/ByteArrayOutputStream, java.io.IOException, java.nio.ByteBuffer, java.nio.channels.SeekableByteChannel/ClosedChannelException, java.util.Arrays, java.util.Objects, java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock and a few constants/methods from org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). It implements a single responsibility (a seekable byte channel backed by a byte array) and contains no evidence in the provided data of many incoming or outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
