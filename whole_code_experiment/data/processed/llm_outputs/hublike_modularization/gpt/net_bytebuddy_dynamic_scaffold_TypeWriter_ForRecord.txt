    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The TypeWriter abstraction is a clear hub: it directly depends on a very large number of other abstractions and subsystems and composes them into a single central coordinator. Examples of outgoing dependencies in this class include many byte-buddy description and implementation types (MethodDescription, FieldDescription, RecordComponentDescription, TypeDescription, MethodList, FieldList, RecordComponentList, Implementation.Context, LoadedTypeInitializer, TypeAttributeAppender, MethodAttributeAppender, FieldAttributeAppender, RecordComponentAttributeAppender, AnnotationValueFilter.Factory, AnnotationRetention, AuxiliaryType.NamingStrategy, TypePool, MethodRegistry), large portions of the ASM API (ClassReader, ClassWriter, ClassVisitor, MethodVisitor, FieldVisitor, ModuleVisitor, RecordComponentVisitor, AnnotationVisitor, Opcodes, TypePath, ConstantDynamic, Handle), and utility classes (AsmClassReader.Factory, AsmClassWriter.Factory, AsmVisitorWrapper, ClassFileLocator, DynamicType, TypeResolutionStrategy). It also defines numerous nested interfaces and classes (FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool and their Record types; Default, ForInlining, WithFullProcessing, ForCreation, ForRedefinition, ForRebasing, WithDecorationOnly, many visitor and handler inner classes), each of which further interacts with many other types (MethodRebaseResolver, Implementation.Target.Factory, TypeInitializer, FrameWriter, ContextRegistry, InitializationHandler, etc.). The class orchestrates and connects these many concerns (ASM visitors, method/field/record component pools, attribute appenders, type validation, class dumping), indicating high incoming/outgoing coupling. This centralization of many dependencies (across net.bytebuddy.* subsystems and org.objectweb.asm.*) makes TypeWriter act as a hub-like module, satisfying the Hub-like Modularization smell."
