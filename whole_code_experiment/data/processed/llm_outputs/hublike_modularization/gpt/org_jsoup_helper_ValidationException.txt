    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.ValidationException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ValidationException has only a small number of dependencies: it extends java.lang.IllegalArgumentException, references org.jsoup.helper.Validate via the static Validator field, and uses core JDK types (java.util.List, java.util.ArrayList, java.lang.StackTraceElement) and their methods (getStackTrace, setStackTrace). There are no signs of this abstraction having incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions (no broad coupling to many modules/classes), so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
