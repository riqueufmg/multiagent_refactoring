    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Composable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Implementation.Composable sits at the center of a large, highly connected API: it is a nested specialization of Implementation (which itself references many types across packages such as ClassFileVersion, CachedReturnPlugin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, numerous description.* types, DynamicType, InstrumentedType, MethodGraph, TypeInitializer, TypeWriter, auxiliary/bytecode/member classes and utility classes). Implementation.Composable is used directly by multiple internal abstractions (e.g. Compound and Compound.Composable rely on and produce Implementation.Composable instances; Compound/Compound.Composable flatten and combine composable implementations). Through its parent interface Implementation it exposes and connects to many other abstractions (ByteCodeAppender, Target, Context, StackManipulation, FieldAccess, MethodInvocation, MethodReturn, MethodVariableAccess, AuxiliaryType, TypeInitializer, etc.), creating both many incoming uses (parts of the framework implement or check for Composable) and many outgoing ties (it inherits the broad surface of Implementation). This concentration of relationships across packages and many distinct types indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
