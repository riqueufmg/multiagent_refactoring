    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableObjIntConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The interface has very few dependencies: a single import/reference to java.util.function.ObjIntConsumer (in Javadoc), the java.lang.Throwable type bound, and standard annotations/suppression. Its API is minimal (one method accept and a nop singleton). There are no incoming/outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not act as a hub."
