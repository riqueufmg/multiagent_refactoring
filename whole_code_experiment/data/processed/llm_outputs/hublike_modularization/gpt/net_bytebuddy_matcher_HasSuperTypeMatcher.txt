    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.HasSuperTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "HasSuperTypeMatcher has a small, focused API and only a few direct dependencies: the ElementMatcher field (matcher), iteration over TypeDefinition/TypeDescription, and use of QueueFactory/Queue and HashSet/Set in doMatch. Its outgoing references are limited to the type system (TypeDefinition, TypeDescription, ElementMatcher) and standard collection/utility classes. There is no evidence in the provided code of many other abstractions depending on HasSuperTypeMatcher (few incoming links), so it is not acting as a dependency hub."
