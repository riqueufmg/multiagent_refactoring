    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SignatureKey is a small value object with two String fields (internalName, descriptor) and simple equals/hashCode implementations. It has many incoming uses across the TypeWriter.Default implementation (examples: declarableFields.put(new SignatureKey(...)), declarableMethods.put(new SignatureKey(...)), fieldKeys, methodsKeys, visitedFields, visitedMethods and DeduplicatingClassVisitor's containment checks), showing it is referenced by many other abstractions. However, its outgoing dependencies are minimal (only java.lang.String, java.lang.Object methods and a nullability annotation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Because SignatureKey has many incoming but very few outgoing dependencies, it does not qualify as a hub-like module."
