    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed abstraction is a small, inner ArgumentProvider implementation with very limited coupling. It holds a single TypeDescription field and its resolve/prepare methods only use NullConstant.INSTANCE and return the provided InstrumentedType unchanged. Although the method signature references MethodDescription, Assigner and Assigner.Typing (from the interface), the implementation does not interact with many distinct abstractions. There is no evidence of high incoming/outgoing dependency degree (no references to many other classes or modules), so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
