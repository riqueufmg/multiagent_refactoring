    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DirectoryProperty has a small, focused set of dependencies: it extends Provider<Directory> and its API references Provider, Directory, File, and FileTree (methods: getAsFile() -> Provider<File>, getAsFileTree() -> FileTree, dir(String) -> Provider<Directory>, set(Provider<Directory>)). Only one analyzed client (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTaskConfiguration) is shown as using DirectoryProperty. The number of incoming and outgoing relationships is small and focused, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
