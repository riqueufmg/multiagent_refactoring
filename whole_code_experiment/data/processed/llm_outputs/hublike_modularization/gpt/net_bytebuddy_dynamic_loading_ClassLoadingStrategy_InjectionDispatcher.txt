    "detection": false,
    "justification": "InjectionDispatcher has a small, focused set of dependencies and collaborators: ProtectionDomain (field), PackageDefinitionStrategy (field), ClassInjector.UsingReflection (instantiated in load), ClassLoader and Map<TypeDescription, byte[]> (method parameters/return). It is created/used by ClassLoadingStrategy.Default (INJECTION) and implements a few Configurable methods (with(ProtectionDomain), with(PackageDefinitionStrategy), with(ClassLoaderDecorator.Factory) which throws UnsupportedOperationException, allowExistingTypes, opened). There is no evidence that this abstraction has incoming and outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions; its interactions are limited and cohesive, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
