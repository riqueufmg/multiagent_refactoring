    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ClassFileLocator.Filtering has only a small number of incoming/outgoing dependencies: it holds an ElementMatcher<? super String> matcher and a ClassFileLocator delegate (fields), calls matcher.matches(name) and delegate.locate(name) in locate(...) and delegate.close() in close(). It does not reference or depend on a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
