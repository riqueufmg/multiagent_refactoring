    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JsonParser is a small, focused facade around parsing responsibilities and only depends on a limited, cohesive set of types: com.google.gson.internal.Streams (delegation), com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader and com.google.gson.stream.JsonToken (parsing), java.io.Reader/java.io.StringReader (I/O), com.google.gson.Strictness (configuration), and a few exception types (JsonSyntaxException, JsonIOException, MalformedJsonException). Incoming references in the provided snapshot are minimal (e.g., javadoc in JsonElement and usage in RawCollectionsExample). The class neither has an unusually large number of incoming dependencies nor interacts with a broad, disparate set of modules, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
