    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PathURLConnection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although PathURLConnection has many outgoing dependencies (uses types from com.google.common: MoreObjects, Ascii, ImmutableListMultimap, ImmutableMap, Iterables; java.io: InputStream, ByteArrayInputStream, IOException; java.net: URL, URI, URISyntaxException, URLConnection; java.nio.file: Files, Paths, Path, DirectoryStream, FileTime; java.text: DateFormat, SimpleDateFormat; java.util: Date, Locale, TimeZone), there is no evidence in the provided code of a large number of incoming dependencies on this abstraction. The class is a final, concrete URLConnection implementation with no visible references or API surface in this snippet that shows many other abstractions depending on it, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization criterion (requires both many incoming and outgoing connections)."
