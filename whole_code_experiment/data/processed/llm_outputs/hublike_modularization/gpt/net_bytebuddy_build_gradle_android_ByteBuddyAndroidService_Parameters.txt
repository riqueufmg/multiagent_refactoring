    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ByteBuddyAndroidService acts as a central coordinator that depends on and interacts with many distinct abstractions. Evidence: (1) Fields and State: the State object aggregates many collaborators (List<Plugin>, Plugin.Engine.TypeStrategy, ByteBuddy, TypePool, ClassFileLocator, ClassLoader, AndroidDescriptor), indicating large outgoing dependencies. (2) initialize(...) constructs and wires together numerous subsystems: ClassFileLocator(s), TypePool, multiple URLClassLoader instances, Plugin.Factory objects, BuildLogger, EntryPoint and ByteBuddy — showing many incoming/outgoing interactions. (3) Core methods delegate heavily to external abstractions: matches(...) consults TypePool and iterates plugins calling onPreprocess and matches; apply(...) uses the type strategy and applies plugin.apply to a DynamicType.Builder and wraps/unwrapped ClassVisitor; close() closes plugins, clears the TypePool, closes ClassFileLocator and class loaders. (4) The class imports and uses a wide range of modules (Gradle APIs, Byte Buddy APIs, ASM ClassVisitor, IO, classloading), demonstrating high coupling to many components. These points show the class has high fan-in and fan-out and functions as a hub, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
