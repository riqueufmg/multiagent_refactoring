    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOrigin.InputStreamOrigin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "InputStreamOrigin has a narrow set of dependencies and responsibilities: it wraps an InputStream and implements a few conversions/delegations (uses IOUtils.toByteArray in getByteArray, Channels.newChannel in getChannel, InputStreamReader in getReader, and checks FileInputStream in size). It does not depend on a large number of different abstractions nor does it act as a central connector between many modules. The broader AbstractOrigin type (the outer class) handles many origin types and conversions, but this specific nested InputStreamOrigin is small and not hub-like."
