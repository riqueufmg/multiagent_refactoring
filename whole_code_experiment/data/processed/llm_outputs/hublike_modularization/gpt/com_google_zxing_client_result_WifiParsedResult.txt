    "detection": false,
    "justification": "WifiParsedResult is a simple data-holder parsed-result used by a few collaborators (incoming deps: WifiResultParser constructs it; WifiResultHandler and WifiConfigManager consume it). Its outgoing dependencies are minimal: it extends ParsedResult and references ParsedResultType.WIFI. The number of distinct incoming and outgoing abstraction dependencies is small (3 consumers + 1 parent/enum), so it does not act as a hub connecting a large number of other abstractions and therefore does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
