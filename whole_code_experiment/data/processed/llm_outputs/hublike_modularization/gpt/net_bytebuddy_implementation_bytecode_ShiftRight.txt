    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ShiftRight",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ShiftRight has only a small number of direct dependencies: it implements StackManipulation, references StackSize (field stackSize and StackSize methods), uses org.objectweb.asm.MethodVisitor and net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Context in apply(...), and uses ASM Opcodes constants. It also declares a nested Unsigned enum (which similarly depends on StackManipulation, StackSize, MethodVisitor and Opcodes). There is no evidence in the analyzed code of incoming and outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions; its relationships are limited and focused, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
