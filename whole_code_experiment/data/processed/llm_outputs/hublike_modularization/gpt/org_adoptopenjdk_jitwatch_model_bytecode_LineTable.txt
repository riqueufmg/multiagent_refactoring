    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LineTable acts as a central hub: many different components across the model and UI depend on it (incoming dependencies) while it itself depends on several abstractions (outgoing dependencies). Examples of incoming dependencies: MemberBytecode constructs and uses a LineTable (MemberBytecode.<init>, addLineTableEntry, getLineTable), SourceMapper queries LineTable (SourceMapper.getMemberBytecodeForSourceLine -> lineTable.sourceLineInRange), TriView uses LineTable and LineTableEntry to map and highlight source/bytecode (TriView.highlightFromSource -> getEntryForSourceLine/getLineTable), ViewerBytecode uses LineTable for source ranges and offset lookups (ViewerBytecode.setContent -> memberBytecode.getLineTable().getSourceRange(...), and MemberBytecode/SourceMapper call LineTable.findSourceLineForBytecodeOffset). Examples of outgoing dependencies from LineTable: it stores and manipulates LineTableEntry objects, holds a MemberBytecode reference, and uses logging and JITWatchConstants utilities. The class is referenced across multiple packages (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview, and mapping classes), showing it has many incoming links and several outgoing ties — characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
