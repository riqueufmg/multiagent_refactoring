    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ResolvedDeclaration acts as a central/root abstraction that both refers to many specific declaration types and is relied upon by them. Outgoing dependencies: its default conversion methods reference multiple concrete declaration interfaces (asField() -> ResolvedFieldDeclaration, asParameter() -> ResolvedParameterDeclaration, asType() -> ResolvedTypeDeclaration, asMethod() -> ResolvedMethodDeclaration, asEnumConstant() -> ResolvedEnumConstantDeclaration, asTypePattern() -> ResolvedTypePatternDeclaration) and it exposes many type-query methods (isField, isParameter, isType, isEnumConstant, isTypePattern, isMethod, etc.). Incoming dependencies: other interfaces in the same package extend or implement the declaration hierarchy and interact with ResolvedDeclaration (for example ResolvedTypeDeclaration extends ResolvedDeclaration and overrides asType(); ResolvedFieldDeclaration, ResolvedParameterDeclaration and ResolvedEnumConstantDeclaration are returned/used by ResolvedDeclaration's API and provide corresponding overrides). Because it has numerous incoming and outgoing ties to many different declaration abstractions, it functions as a hub and thus exhibits Hub-like Modularization."
