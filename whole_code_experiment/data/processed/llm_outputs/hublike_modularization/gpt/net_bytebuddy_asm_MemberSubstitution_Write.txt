    "detection": true,
    "justification": "MemberSubstitution (and its nested Write variant) acts as a hub: it directly depends on a very large number of distinct abstractions and exposes many nested types that themselves depend on many abstractions. Examples of outgoing dependencies from this class include: MethodGraph.Compiler, TypePoolResolver/TypePool, TypeDescription/TypeDefinition/TypeList, MethodDescription/MethodList/ParameterDescription, FieldDescription/FieldList, Replacement/Replacement.Factory, Substitution and many Substitution implementations (Stubbing, ForValue, ForFieldAccess, ForMethodInvocation, Chain and its Step variants), Assigner, StackManipulation and StackSize, Implementation.Context, FieldLocator, Dispatcher, OffsetMapping, BootstrapArgumentResolver and many ElementMatcher/ElementMatchers utilities. It also imports and coordinates across multiple packages (net.bytebuddy.description.*, net.bytebuddy.implementation.*, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.*, net.bytebuddy.utility.*, org.objectweb.asm.*, java.lang.reflect.*, etc.). Furthermore the class defines numerous nested factories, enums and interfaces (Replacement.Binding, Substitution.Factory, Substitution.Chain.Factory, Chain.Step.Factory, OffsetMapping.Factory, Dispatcher.Factory, BootstrapArgumentResolver.Factory, many For* inner classes) that create additional incoming references from other components at runtime. The combination of (a) many direct type references in methods and fields, (b) a large number of nested types exposing factory/resolve methods, and (c) coordination between many subsystems (type description, bytecode manipulation, matching, factories, dispatchers) demonstrates that this abstraction has both many incoming collaborators and many outgoing dependencies, satisfying the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
