    "justification": "The CompoundIterator is a small, focused nested iterator implementation with very few dependencies: it implements Iterator<Element> and uses a QueueFactory to hold Iterable<? extends Element> instances, calls iterator(), and throws NoSuchElementException/UnsupportedOperationException. It does not reference a large number of other abstractions or modules (no many incoming/outgoing dependencies), so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
