    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LanguageManager acts as a central hub with many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Outgoing dependencies: its getCompiler(...) and getRuntime(...) methods directly instantiate and depend on many concrete compiler and runtime classes (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerGroovy, CompilerJava, CompilerJavaScript, CompilerJRuby, CompilerKotlin, CompilerScala and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeGroovy, RuntimeJava, RuntimeJavaScript, RuntimeJRuby, RuntimeKotlin, RuntimeScala) and rely on JITWatchConfig and ILogListener. Its static helpers (getLanguageFromFile, getFileExtension, getKnownFilenameExtensions, isCompilable, isLanguageEnabled) encode mappings for many languages and extensions. Incoming dependencies: many other abstractions use LanguageManager (examples in the codebase provided) — ResourceLoader calls LanguageManager.getKnownFilenameExtensions() and getLanguageFromFile(), Sandbox constructs a LanguageManager and calls getCompiler/getRuntime, SandboxStage and VMLanguageList call LanguageManager static methods (isCompilable, getLanguageFromFile, isLanguageEnabled). Because it both depends on many language-specific classes and is depended on by many unrelated modules (resource loading, sandbox orchestration, UI stages), it exhibits Hub-like Modularization: high fan-in and high fan-out centered on this single abstraction."
