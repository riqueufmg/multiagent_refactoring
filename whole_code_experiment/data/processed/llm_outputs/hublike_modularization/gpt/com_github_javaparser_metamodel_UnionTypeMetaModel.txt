    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.UnionTypeMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "UnionTypeMetaModel has very few dependencies: it extends TypeMetaModel, is constructed with an Optional<BaseNodeMetaModel> and UnionType.class, and declares a single PropertyMetaModel field (elementsPropertyMetaModel) referencing referenceTypeMetaModel. Its uses in JavaParserMetaModel are limited (added to the nodeMetaModels list and its single elementsPropertyMetaModel is initialized). There is no large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
