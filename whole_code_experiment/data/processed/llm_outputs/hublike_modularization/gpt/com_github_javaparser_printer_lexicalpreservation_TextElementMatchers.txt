    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElementMatchers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TextElementMatchers only provides two small static factory methods (byTokenType and byNode). Its outgoing dependencies are limited: it returns TextElementMatcher and references TextElement (via textElement.isToken(...) / textElement.isNode(...)) and Node (in byNode). It has no state, no fields, and no large number of collaborators. Incoming usage in the provided code is minimal (e.g., NodeText.findChild / tryToFindChild call TextElementMatchers.byNode). There is no evidence in the shown code of many incoming and outgoing dependencies that would make this class a hub."
