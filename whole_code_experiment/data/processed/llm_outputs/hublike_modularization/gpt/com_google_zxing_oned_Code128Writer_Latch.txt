    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small, focused set of external dependencies (OneDimensionalCodeWriter, Code128Reader (CODE_PATTERNS), com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.EncodeHintType, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix and standard Java collection/Map classes). Most functionality is self-contained, including the nested MinimalEncoder. There is no evidence of this class having incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of distinct abstractions that would make it a hub; the primary coupling is to Code128Reader for pattern data and to a few ZXing and JDK types, which is expected for its responsibility."
