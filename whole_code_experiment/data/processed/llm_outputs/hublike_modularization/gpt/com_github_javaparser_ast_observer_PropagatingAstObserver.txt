    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PropagatingAstObserver has a small, focused set of dependencies and responsibilities: it implements/works with AstObserver and references ObservableProperty, AstObserver.ListChangeType, Node, NodeList and Observable to propagate registration/unregistration across node subtrees. The main incoming dependency is Node (Node.register uses PropagatingAstObserver.transformInPropagatingObserver for SELF_PROPAGATING mode). These relationships are cohesive for the observer-propagation concern and do not represent dependencies with a large number of disparate abstractions, so it does not qualify as a hub-like modularization smell."
