    "justification": "BndGenerator has a small, focused set of dependencies: it extends Generator and uses SourceRoot (constructor + getRoot()), com.github.javaparser.utils.Log, and a handful of java.nio/java.io classes (Files, Path, Stream, Writer, StandardCharsets, File). There is no evidence in the provided code of incoming dependencies from many other abstractions, nor of outgoing dependencies to a large number of different modules. The coupling surface is limited and specific to file/package traversal and templated output, so it does not qualify as a hub-like module."
