    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.BlockParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BlockParsedResult has a single outgoing dependency: the DecodedInformation type (field 'decodedInformation', constructor BlockParsedResult(DecodedInformation, boolean), and method getDecodedInformation()). Its incoming usage is limited (primarily instantiated and consumed by GeneralAppIdDecoder in methods parseNumericBlock(), parseIsoIec646Block(), parseAlphaBlock() and parseBlocks()). It does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions and acts as a small DTO/result holder rather than a hub, so the Hub-like Modularization smell is not present."
