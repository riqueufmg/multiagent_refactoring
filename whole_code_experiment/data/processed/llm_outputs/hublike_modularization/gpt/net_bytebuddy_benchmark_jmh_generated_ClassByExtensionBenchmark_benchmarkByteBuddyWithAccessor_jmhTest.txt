    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although this generated JMH test class has many outgoing dependencies (numerous imports and usages of JMH/infra types such as InfraControl, ThreadParams, BenchmarkTaskResult, RawResults, SampleBuffer, BenchmarkParams, IterationParams, Blackhole, Control, ThroughputResult/AverageTimeResult/SampleTimeResult/SingleShotResult, etc.), there is no evidence in the provided code of many incoming dependencies (few or no other abstractions depending on this class). The hub smell requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here only outgoing connections are present, so Hub-like Modularization is not detected."
