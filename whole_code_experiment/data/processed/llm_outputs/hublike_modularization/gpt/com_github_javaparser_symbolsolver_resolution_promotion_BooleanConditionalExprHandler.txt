    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.promotion.BooleanConditionalExprHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only a small number of dependencies: it implements com.github.javaparser.resolution.promotion.ConditionalExprHandler and uses com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType (fields thenExpr and elseExpr). Its resolveType() method calls a few ResolvedType operations (isReferenceType(), asReferenceType(), isPrimitive()) and no other types or modules are referenced. There is no evidence in the provided data of many incoming dependents or a large number of outgoing dependencies to other abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
