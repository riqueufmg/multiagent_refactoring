    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.viewer.AbstractTextViewerStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AbstractTextViewerStage has only a small number of dependencies: it extends javafx.stage.Stage and uses Viewer (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.Viewer), JITWatchUI (as constructor parameter type), and UserInterfaceUtil (to create the Scene). Its methods (constructor and setContent) primarily delegate to Viewer (new Viewer(...), viewer.setContent(...)) and to UserInterfaceUtil.getScene(...). The class does not show many incoming or outgoing dependencies to a large set of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
