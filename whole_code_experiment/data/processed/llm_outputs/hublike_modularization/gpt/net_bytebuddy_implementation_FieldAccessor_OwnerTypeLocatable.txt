    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.OwnerTypeLocatable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "OwnerTypeLocatable is a small fluent interface with only three methods (in(Class<?>), in(TypeDescription), in(FieldLocator.Factory)) and it extends AssignerConfigurable. Its API references only a few other abstractions (Class, TypeDescription, FieldLocator.Factory/Assigner via the superinterface). While the enclosing FieldAccessor class interacts with many types, the OwnerTypeLocatable abstraction itself has low coupling and does not show incoming/outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions, so it is not a hub."
