    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.CountingPathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CountingPathVisitor has several outgoing dependencies (SimplePathVisitor, Counters.PathCounters, PathFilter, IOFileFilter, SymbolicLinkFileFilter, TrueFileFilter, IOBiFunction, Files, Path, BasicFileAttributes, FileVisitResult, UnaryOperator, Objects, IOException, BigInteger) that are directly related to its responsibility of visiting, filtering and counting filesystem paths. The dependencies are cohesive and domain-specific (file visiting, filtering, counting) rather than an excessive, cross-cutting set of unrelated abstractions. The provided relationship information does not show a large number of incoming dependencies from many other, disparate modules (only the expected builder/visitor relationships), so there is no strong evidence that this class acts as a hub connecting many unrelated abstractions. Therefore Hub-like Modularization is not detected."
