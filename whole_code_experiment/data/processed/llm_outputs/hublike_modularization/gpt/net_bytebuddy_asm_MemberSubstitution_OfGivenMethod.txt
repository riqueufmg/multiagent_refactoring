    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The analyzed abstraction is part of MemberSubstitution which acts as a central hub: it depends on and composes a large number of other abstractions across many packages (e.g. net.bytebuddy.description.*: MethodDescription, FieldDescription, TypeDescription; net.bytebuddy.dynamic.*: TypePool, ClassFileLocator; net.bytebuddy.implementation.*: Implementation, Assigner; net.bytebuddy.matcher.*: ElementMatcher; net.bytebuddy.utility.*; org.objectweb.asm.MethodVisitor/Opcodes; java.lang.reflect.*; java.util.*). It also declares many public inner interfaces and classes (Replacement, Replacement.Factory, Replacement.Binding, Substitution and its Factory implementations, Substitution.Chain and many Step/OffsetMapping/Dispatcher variants, Target, Source) that mediate interactions between these types. MemberSubstitution (and its nested OfGivenMethod) both uses many external abstractions (wide outgoing dependencies shown by imports and usage) and exposes many types and factories intended to be used by others (incoming dependencies). The high number of distinct collaborators and the central coordination role (resolving bindings, creating substitutions, bridging ASM, type descriptors, method/field resolution and factories) indicate a hub-like modularization smell."
