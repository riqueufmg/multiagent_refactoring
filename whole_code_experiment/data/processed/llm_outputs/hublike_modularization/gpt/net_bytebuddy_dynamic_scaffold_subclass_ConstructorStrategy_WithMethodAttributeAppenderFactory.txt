    "detection": false,
    "justification": "WithMethodAttributeAppenderFactory is a small wrapper that holds only two fields (delegate: ConstructorStrategy.Default and methodAttributeAppenderFactory: MethodAttributeAppender.Factory) and implements two methods that simply delegate to the underlying default strategy (extractConstructors delegates to delegate.extractConstructors; inject delegates to delegate.doInject(..., methodAttributeAppenderFactory)). It does not maintain incoming/outgoing dependencies to a large number of distinct abstractions (primary direct dependencies are Default, MethodAttributeAppender.Factory and MethodRegistry). Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
