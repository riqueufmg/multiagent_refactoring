    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassFilePostProcessor.ForClassFileTransformer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ForClassFileTransformer has a small, focused set of dependencies: ClassFileTransformer (delegation target), ProtectionDomain, ClassLoader, IllegalClassFormatException, the nested AllPermissionsCollection (extends PermissionCollection, uses AllPermission, Collections, Enumeration) and nullability annotations (AlwaysNull, MaybeNull). It also carries a reference to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin.Enhance as an annotation. These are a limited, cohesive group (JDK security types, transformer API, small utility classes and one build-time annotation). There is no evidence of wide incoming and outgoing coupling to a large number of other abstractions in the provided relationships, so this does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
