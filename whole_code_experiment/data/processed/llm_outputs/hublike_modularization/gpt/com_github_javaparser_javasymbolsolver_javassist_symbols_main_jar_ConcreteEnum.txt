    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The type defines only two enum constants (ENUM_VAL_ONE, ENUM_VAL_TWO) and two static String constants (STATIC_STRING, SECOND_STRING). It contains no fields or methods referencing other types, no imports, and no visible incoming/outgoing dependencies to many other abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
