    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. In this code, the only observed dependency is a single incoming usage from InnerStaticClassFieldDotExpressions (accessing InnerStaticClassFieldContainer.InnerClass.InnerInnerClass.MY_INT). There are no multiple incoming callers and no outgoing dependencies to many other abstractions, so the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
