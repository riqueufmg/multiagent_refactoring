    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableIntUnaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The interface has a very small set of dependencies: java.util.Objects (used for null checks), a reference to java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator only in documentation, and self-references to FailableIntUnaryOperator (compose/andThen/identity/nop). There are no many incoming or outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions (no extensive imports or references to many other modules/types), so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
