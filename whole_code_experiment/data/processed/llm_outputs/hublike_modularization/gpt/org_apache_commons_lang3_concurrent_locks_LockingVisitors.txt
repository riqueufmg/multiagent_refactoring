    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks.LockingVisitors",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LockingVisitors has a small, cohesive set of external dependencies (java.util.concurrent.locks: Lock, ReadWriteLock, ReentrantLock, ReentrantReadWriteLock, StampedLock; java.util.function.Supplier; java.util.Objects; and internal helpers org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.AbstractSupplier, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.{Failable,FailableConsumer,FailableFunction,Suppliers}). All nested visitor classes (ReadWriteLockVisitor, ReentrantLockVisitor, StampedLockVisitor, LockVisitor and its LVBuilder) are part of the same abstraction rather than many unrelated abstractions. The number of distinct incoming/outgoing dependencies is limited and focused on providing lock/visitor utilities, and there is no evidence in the provided code of a large number of other unrelated abstractions depending on or being depended upon by this class. Therefore it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
