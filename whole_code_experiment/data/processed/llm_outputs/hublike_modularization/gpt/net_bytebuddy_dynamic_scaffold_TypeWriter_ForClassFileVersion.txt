    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The analyzed abstraction acts as a central hub: it directly depends on (outgoing) a very large number of different abstractions (see the extensive import list: many net.bytebuddy.* packages, org.objectweb.asm.*, collections and utility types). Within Default and its nested types it holds fields typed to many collaborators: ClassFileVersion, TypeDescription, FieldPool, RecordComponentPool, List<? extends DynamicType>, FieldList<FieldDescription.InDefinedShape>, MethodList, MethodRegistry (used in factory methods), LoadedTypeInitializer, TypeInitializer, TypeAttributeAppender, AsmVisitorWrapper, AnnotationValueFilter.Factory, AnnotationRetention, AuxiliaryType.NamingStrategy, Implementation.Context.Factory, AsmClassReader.Factory, AsmClassWriter.Factory, TypePool, ClassFileLocator, MethodRebaseResolver, SubclassImplementationTarget.Factory and others. It exposes many factory methods (forCreation, forRedefinition, forRebasing, forDecoration) that accept and return numerous different subsystem types (MethodRegistry.Compiled/Prepared, ClassFileLocator, MethodRebaseResolver, Implementation.Target.Factory, etc.), indicating many incoming relationships. The large number of nested interfaces and records (FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool and their many Record implementations and wrappers) further increases coupling with many abstractions (ASM visitors, Method/Field/Record descriptors, attribute appenders, byte-code appenders, frame writers, etc.). Together these facts show this abstraction has both extensive outgoing dependencies and acts as a central integration point for many other components, i.e. a hub-like modularization smell."
