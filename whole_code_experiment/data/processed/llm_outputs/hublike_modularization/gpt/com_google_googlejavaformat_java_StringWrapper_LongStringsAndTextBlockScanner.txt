    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The nested scanner is a small, focused utility with limited coupling: it is a private inner class of Reflower and is instantiated/used only in Reflower.getReflowReplacements() (new LongStringsAndTextBlockScanner(...).scan(new TreePath(unit), null)). Its outgoing dependencies are a short, expected set of AST and utility types (extends TreePathScanner<Void,Void>, references LiteralTree, MemberSelectTree, Tree, Tree.Kind, TreePath, Newlines, and helper methods getStartPosition/getEndPosition). There is no evidence in this class of many incoming dependents — it is private and only used by its enclosing Reflower — nor an unusually large number of outgoing dependencies across many unrelated abstractions. Responsibilities are narrow (identifying long string literals and text blocks), so this is not a hub-like modularization."
