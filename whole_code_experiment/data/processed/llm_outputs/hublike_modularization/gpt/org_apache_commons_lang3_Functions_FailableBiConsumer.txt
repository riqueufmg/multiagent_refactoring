    "justification": "Functions acts as a hub: it depends on and connects a large number of distinct abstractions (java.util.function types: BiConsumer, BiFunction, BiPredicate, Consumer, Function, Predicate, Supplier, Callable, Runnable; java.util.stream.Stream and Streams.FailableStream; utility classes ExceptionUtils, Arrays, Collection; exception types IOException, UncheckedIOException, UndeclaredThrowableException; and org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable and FailableBooleanSupplier). It defines many failable variants (FailableConsumer, FailableFunction, FailablePredicate, FailableSupplier, FailableCallable, FailableRunnable, FailableBiConsumer, FailableBiFunction, FailableBiPredicate) and provides conversion methods (asConsumer, asFunction, asPredicate, asSupplier, asCallable, asRunnable, asBiConsumer, asBiFunction, asBiPredicate) plus bridging utilities (accept, apply, get, run, call, rethrow, tryWithResources, stream). Because it has incoming/outgoing relationships with many different abstractions and centrally mediates their interaction (wrapping/rethrowing exceptions and converting between failable and standard functional interfaces), it exhibits Hub-like Modularization."
