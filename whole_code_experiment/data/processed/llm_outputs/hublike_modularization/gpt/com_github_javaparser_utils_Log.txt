    "justification": "Log is not a hub in the provided dependency set. Incoming usages are limited (e.g. com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot calls Log.info/trace/error; com.github.javaparser.generator.core.CoreGenerator calls Log.setAdapter and instantiates Log.StandardOutStandardErrorAdapter). Its outgoing dependencies are standard library types and small utilities (java.io.StringWriter, java.io.PrintWriter, java.io.IOException, java.util.function.Supplier, and CodeGenerationUtils.f) and its own Adapter interface/implementations. There is no evidence here of Log having incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
