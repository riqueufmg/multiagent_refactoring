    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser.CompilationChooser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CompilationChooser has a small, focused set of dependencies (IMemberSelectedListener in its constructor, IMetaMember and Compilation in compilationChanged, and JavaFX UI types). It is referenced directly by TriView and CompileChainStage (two incoming usages shown), not a large number of other abstractions. The class acts as a simple UI helper that forwards selection events and populates a combo from a member's compilations, rather than a central hub with many incoming and outgoing links. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
