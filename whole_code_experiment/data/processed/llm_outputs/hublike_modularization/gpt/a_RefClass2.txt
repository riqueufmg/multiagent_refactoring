    "class": "a.RefClass2",

    "justification": "RefClass2 declares two fields of type Runnable (one static, one instance). Its only outgoing dependency is a single abstraction (java.lang.Runnable) and there are no indications of numerous incoming or outgoing dependencies with many different abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
