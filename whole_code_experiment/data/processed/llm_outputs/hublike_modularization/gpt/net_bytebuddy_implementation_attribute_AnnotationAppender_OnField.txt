    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender.OnField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "OnField is a small wrapper target with very limited dependencies: it holds a single org.objectweb.asm.FieldVisitor (constructor: public OnField(FieldVisitor fieldVisitor)) and its two methods delegate to fieldVisitor.visitAnnotation(...) and fieldVisitor.visitTypeAnnotation(..., TypePath.fromString(typePath), ...), returning an org.objectweb.asm.AnnotationVisitor. It uses MaybeNull for annotations but does not interact with many different abstractions. There are no indications of a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies (only FieldVisitor, TypePath and AnnotationVisitor are directly involved), so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
