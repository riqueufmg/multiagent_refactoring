    "class": "(default package).Issue300.B",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Issue300.B has a single outgoing dependency: it instantiates Issue300.A and accesses its field (new A().i = 0). There are no incoming dependencies to B from other abstractions in the analyzed code. The number of incoming and outgoing dependencies is minimal (outgoing=1, incoming=0), so it does not meet the 'hub-like' criterion of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
