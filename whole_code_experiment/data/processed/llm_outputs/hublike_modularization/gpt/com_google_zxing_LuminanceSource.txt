    "class": "com.google.zxing.LuminanceSource",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LuminanceSource is a clear hub: it has many incoming dependencies from multiple packages and components (uses across the codebase). Clients and dependents include BinaryBitmap, Binarizer and its concrete subclasses (GlobalHistogramBinarizer, HybridBinarizer), BinaryBitmap users (DecodeWorker, GUIRunner, DecodeServlet), and multiple concrete LuminanceSource implementations (PlanarYUVLuminanceSource, GrayscaleLuminanceSource, InvertedLuminanceSource). These classes span different modules (com.google.zxing, com.google.zxing.common, com.google.zxing.client.j2se, com.google.zxing.web), showing high fan-in. LuminanceSource also has outgoing dependencies: it constructs/returns InvertedLuminanceSource in invert(), defines factory-style operations (crop/rotate) that create/return other LuminanceSource instances, and its API (getRow/getMatrix/isCropSupported/isRotateSupported) tightly couples implementations and binarizers. The combination of many incoming clients across modules and the class acting as a central abstraction/creator (outgoing relations to InvertedLuminanceSource and via its factory-like methods) matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
