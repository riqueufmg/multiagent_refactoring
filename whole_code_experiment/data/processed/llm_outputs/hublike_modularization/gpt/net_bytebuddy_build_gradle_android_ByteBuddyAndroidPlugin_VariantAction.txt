    "detection": false,
    "justification": "VariantAction has many outgoing dependencies (it references Project, Configuration, Variant, ConfigurationConfigurationAction, VariantConfigurationConfigurationAction, RuntimeClassPathResolver.INSTANCE, TRANSFORMATION_DISPATCHER, ByteBuddyAndroidService provider, ByteBuddyTransformationConfiguration, ByteBuddyAsmClassVisitorFactory, etc.), but very few incoming dependencies: it is instantiated and registered only in ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.apply (extension.onVariants(..., new VariantAction(...))). Because it is not referenced by a large number of other abstractions (no widespread incoming coupling) it does not meet the definition of a hub-like modularization despite its high outgoing coupling."
