    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ConditionalExprResolver has a small, focused set of dependencies: it inspects ResolvedType and ResolvedPrimitiveType and constructs one of three handler implementations (BooleanConditionalExprHandler, NumericConditionalExprHandler, ReferenceConditionalExprHandler). Usage shown is limited (TypeExtractor.invoke: ConditionalExprResolver.getConditionExprHandler(...) calls it). There is no evidence in the provided code of a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies (only ResolvedType/ResolvedPrimitiveType, ConditionalExprHandler and the three handler classes, and a caller in TypeExtractor), so it does not qualify as a hub-like module."
