    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AtomicInitializer.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only a small number of dependencies: it extends AbstractBuilder (nested Builder), constructs/returns AtomicInitializer, and the enclosing AtomicInitializer uses AtomicReference and references FailableSupplier, FailableConsumer, AbstractConcurrentInitializer, and ConcurrentException. There is no evidence in the provided code of dependencies (incoming or outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions or modules. The coupling is limited and focused on initializer/closer suppliers and the atomic reference; therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
