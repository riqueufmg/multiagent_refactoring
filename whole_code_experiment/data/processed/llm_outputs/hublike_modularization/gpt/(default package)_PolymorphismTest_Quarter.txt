    "class": "(default package).PolymorphismTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not act as a hub connecting a large number of distinct abstractions. It defines one interface (Coin) and three small inner implementations (Nickel, Dime, Quarter) and uses them locally. Dependencies are limited: the Coin interface is implemented by three classes and referenced in the constructor (local variables nickel, dime, quarter, coin). There are no many incoming/outgoing dependencies to a large set of other abstractions or modules, so the Hub-like Modularization smell is not present."
