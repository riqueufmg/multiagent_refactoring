    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ThreadUtils.ThreadPredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ThreadPredicate is a small functional interface with a single method boolean test(Thread). Its outgoing dependency is essentially only java.lang.Thread (the test parameter). Incoming usages/implementations in the provided code are limited to three nested classes: AlwaysTruePredicate, NamePredicate, and ThreadIdPredicate, plus a few deprecated overloads that accept ThreadPredicate (findThreads(ThreadPredicate), findThreads(ThreadGroup, boolean, ThreadPredicate), etc.). The API also provides and prefers java.util.function.Predicate<Thread> for new code. There is no evidence of dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
