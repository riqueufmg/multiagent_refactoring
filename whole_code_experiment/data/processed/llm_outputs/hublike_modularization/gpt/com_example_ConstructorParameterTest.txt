    "justification": "ConstructorParameterTest has only a small number of dependencies: the standard java.lang.String type and two annotation types (com.github.javaparser.quality.NotNull and com.github.javaparser.quality.Nullable). There is no evidence in the provided relationships of many incoming dependencies (no other classes reference this class) nor of many outgoing dependencies (only the two annotation types are imported). Therefore it does not act as a hub connecting a large number of other abstractions."
