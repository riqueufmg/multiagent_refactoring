    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks.LockingVisitors.LockVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although LockVisitor is a central abstraction used by several inner visitors and builders (ReadWriteLockVisitor, ReentrantLockVisitor, StampedLockVisitor, LVBuilder) and interacts with multiple lock-related types (java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock, ReadWriteLock, ReentrantLock, ReentrantReadWriteLock, StampedLock) and functional/helper types (java.util.function.Supplier, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable, FailableConsumer, FailableFunction, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.AbstractSupplier, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Suppliers, java.util.Objects), these dependencies are limited in scope and are directly related to the class's cohesive responsibility (providing lock-wrapped access patterns). The coupling is intentional (supporting different lock implementations and builder patterns) and primarily local to the locking/visitor concern rather than a broad, application-wide web of incoming/outgoing dependencies. Therefore it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
