    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.CollectionErasureMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CollectionErasureMatcher has a small, focused set of dependencies: it extends ElementMatcher.Junction.ForNonNullValues, holds a field of type ElementMatcher<? super Iterable<? extends TypeDescription>> (matcher), and uses TypeDefinition, TypeDescription, List/ArrayList and standard control flow (for-loop, toString). Its outgoing couplings are limited to ElementMatcher (and its nested junction base), TypeDefinition/TypeDescription, and java.util.List/ArrayList. In the provided analyzed set there are no incoming dependencies referencing CollectionErasureMatcher (neither HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin nor ElementMatcher refer to it). Because it does not interact with a large number of other abstractions in both directions, it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
