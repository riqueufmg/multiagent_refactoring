    "class": "org.jsoup.UnsupportedMimeTypeException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a simple exception extending java.io.IOException (one outgoing dependency) and uses only java.lang.String fields (mimeType, url). It defines a constructor, two getters, and toString() that calls super.toString() and concatenates its fields. There are no references to or interactions with a large number of other abstractions, no registries, managers, or broad coupling evident in the code, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
