    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.GoogleJavaFormatTool",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only a small, limited set of dependencies (implements javax.tools.Tool; uses java.io.InputStream/OutputStream/PrintStream, java.util.Arrays, java.util.Set, javax.lang.model.SourceVersion, com.google.auto.service.AutoService, and delegates to Main.main). There is no evidence in this file of extensive incoming or outgoing coupling to a large number of other abstractions (it acts as a thin adapter/delegator), so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
