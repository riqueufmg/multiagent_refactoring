    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AstObserverAdapter has very few direct dependencies: its imports/reference types are Node, NodeList, ObservableProperty and the ListChangeType/ AstObserver API (method parameter types in propertyChange/parentChange/listChange/listReplacement). It implements a small adapter with empty method bodies (no complex logic). While Node and NodeList maintain lists of AstObserver (showing they depend on the AstObserver abstraction), the adapter itself does not depend on a large number of other abstractions nor does the provided code show many incoming dependencies from many different modules. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
