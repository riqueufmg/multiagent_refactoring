    "detection": false,
    "justification": "J9Line has a small, focused set of dependencies rather than acting as a hub. Outgoing dependencies include J9Util (convertJ9SigToLogCompilationSignature / parsing helpers), MemberSignatureParts (getMemberSignatureParts), Tag and Task (toTagQueued, toTagNMethod, toTagTask), StringUtil (attributeMapToString), and uses LogParseException and JITWatchConstants. Incoming usages are limited: J9Util.parseLine constructs J9Line and J9LogParser uses J9Line instances in parseLogFile. The number of incoming and outgoing collaborators is small and directly related to its parsing/representation responsibilities, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
