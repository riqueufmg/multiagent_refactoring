    "detection": true,
    "justification": "This class is a clear hub: it depends on a very large number of other abstractions (and is the central point that coordinates them). Evidence: (1) Extensive imports across many modules: com.google.googlejavaformat.* (Doc, Indent, OpsBuilder, Input, Newlines, Op, OpenOp, CloseOp, Output.BreakTag, FormattingError, etc.), com.google.common.collect.*, com.google.auto.value.*, plus many java.* and javax.* utilities. (2) Heavy coupling to the Java compiler AST API: dozens of com.sun.source.tree.* types are referenced and handled (AnnotationTree, ArrayAccessTree, ClassTree, CompilationUnitTree, MethodTree, VariableTree, LambdaExpressionTree, SwitchTree, TryTree, many more). (3) Numerous visitX methods implementing logic for almost every AST node kind, making the class have both incoming and outgoing dependencies to many AST node classes and formatting helpers. (4) Uses multiple helper classes (DimensionHelpers, Trees, TypeNameClassifier) and low-level token/input APIs (builder, Input.Token maps). Together these make JavaInputAstVisitor a central hub with very high fan-in/fan-out, indicating Hub-like Modularization."
