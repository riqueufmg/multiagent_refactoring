    "justification": "LongConstant is a small, focused enum with few outgoing dependencies (StackSize, StackManipulation, Implementation, org.objectweb.asm.MethodVisitor, org.objectweb.asm.Opcodes and its own ConstantPool inner class which is annotated with HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin.Enhance). In the provided corpus it has minimal incoming usage (DefaultValue references LongConstant.ZERO). There is no evidence of a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies that would mark it as a hub."
