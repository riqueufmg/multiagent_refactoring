    "detection": true,
    "justification": "SubtypeOfBound is a central connector in the type-inference/bounds subsystem: it is created and relied upon by multiple other modules (incoming dependencies) and itself depends on many abstractions (outgoing dependencies). Examples of incoming usages: TypeInference.boundSetup(...) constructs new SubtypeOfBound instances for inference variables; BoundSet incorporates and inspects SubtypeOfBound instances (multiple instanceof checks and pair-processing such as forEachPairSubtypeAndSubtype and deriveImpliedBounds rely on SubtypeOfBound). Examples of outgoing dependencies from SubtypeOfBound: it uses com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType (fields s,t), calls TypeHelper.isProperType and TypeHelper.usedInferenceVariables, returns/uses InferenceVariable and ProperUpperBound/ProperLowerBound, and references InferenceVariableSubstitution in isSatisfied. Because SubtypeOfBound has many incoming dependents (TypeInference, BoundSet, and bound-processing logic) and many outgoing links to core type and inference abstractions (ResolvedType, TypeHelper, InferenceVariable, ProperUpperBound/LowerBound, InferenceVariableSubstitution), it functions as a hub-like module."
