    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Evaluator abstraction acts as a central hub: it defines numerous concrete inner evaluator types (e.g., Tag, TagStartsWith, TagEndsWith, Id, Class, Attribute, AttributeStarting, AttributeWithValue*, AllElements, IndexLessThan/GreaterThan/Equals, CssNthEvaluator and many Is*/Matches*/Contains* variants) indicating many outgoing responsibilities. The file also imports and directly depends on a large set of other abstractions (org.jsoup.nodes.Element, Node, LeafNode, TextNode, Comment, Document, DocumentType, XmlDeclaration, PseudoTextElement; parsing/utility types like ParseSettings, org.jsoup.helper.Regex, java.util.regex.Pattern, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, and normalizer/string utilities). The class is referenced by external APIs (the header javadoc cites Selector#evaluatorOf and the asPredicate/asNodePredicate methods expose Predicate interfaces), implying many incoming collaborators. Together, the high number of inner evaluator variants plus dependencies on many node and utility classes (both incoming and outgoing relations) matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
