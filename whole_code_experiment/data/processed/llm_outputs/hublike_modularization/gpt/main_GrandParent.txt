    "justification": "GrandParent contains only an inner enum MyEnum with two constants (A, B) that use string literals \"a\" and \"b\" and a static import of its own inner enum. There are no incoming or outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions (no references to many other classes or modules), so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
