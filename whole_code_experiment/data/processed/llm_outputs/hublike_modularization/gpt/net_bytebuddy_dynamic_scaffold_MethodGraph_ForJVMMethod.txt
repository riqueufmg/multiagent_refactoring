    "justification": "ForJVMMethod is a small harmonizer enum with a single INSTANCE and a nested Token class. Its outgoing dependencies are limited to MethodDescription.TypeToken (used by harmonize and Token) and standard Object methods (hashCode, equals, toString). It does not reference or aggregate a large number of other abstractions (no extensive maps, graphs, or many other types), nor does it act as a central hub delegating to many different modules. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
