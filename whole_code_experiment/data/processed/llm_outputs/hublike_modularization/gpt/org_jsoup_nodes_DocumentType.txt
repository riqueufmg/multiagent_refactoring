    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.DocumentType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DocumentType has a modest number of incoming references (Document.documentType() checks for instanceof DocumentType; HtmlTreeBuilderState and XmlTreeBuilder create/insert DocumentType nodes; TokeniserState references its PUBLIC/SYSTEM constants; W3CDom.fromJsoup reads its publicId/systemId/name). Its outgoing dependencies are small and focused: extends LeafNode and uses org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable (outerHtmlHead), org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil (has/isBlank usage), org.jsoup.helper.Validate (constructor checks), and Document.OutputSettings.Syntax for output decisions. The interactions are cohesive around doctype creation/serialization and involve a limited set of related classes rather than a large, wide-ranging set of abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
