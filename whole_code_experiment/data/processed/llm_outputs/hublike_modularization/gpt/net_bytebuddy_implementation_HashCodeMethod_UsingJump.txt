    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.UsingJump",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The UsingJump guard is a small, narrowly scoped inner class: it depends on a handful of abstractions (MethodDescription.InDefinedShape for instrumentedMethod, org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.MethodVisitor/Opcodes, Implementation.Context and StackManipulation.AbstractBase). Its usage is localized (constructed by HashCodeMethod.Appender as new NullValueGuard.UsingJump(instrumentedMethod) and applied only within the hash code generation flow). It does not have incoming and outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions across the codebase, so it does not act as a hub connecting many modules."
