    "justification": "ComparableUtils has a very small set of dependencies and interactions: it references java.lang.Comparable (generic bound), java.util.function.Predicate (factory return type) and a single utility class org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils. Its only internal collaborator is the nested ComparableCheckBuilder. Methods are simple predicates/delegates (is(...), between(...), gt/le/lt/ge, min/max) and do not create incoming/outgoing links to a large number of other abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
