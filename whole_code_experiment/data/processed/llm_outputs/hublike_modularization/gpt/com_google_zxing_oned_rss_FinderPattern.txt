    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.FinderPattern",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FinderPattern has many incoming references (used/constructed or queried by RSS14Reader, RSSExpandedReader, Pair, ExpandedPair, and other readers/decoder code—e.g. calls to getFinderPattern(), getResultPoints(), getStartEnd()). However its outgoing dependencies are minimal: it only depends on com.google.zxing.ResultPoint and primitive/array types (int, int[], ResultPoint[]). Because it primarily acts as a small data holder referenced by several modules rather than depending on many other abstractions itself, it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization (high both incoming and outgoing coupling)."
