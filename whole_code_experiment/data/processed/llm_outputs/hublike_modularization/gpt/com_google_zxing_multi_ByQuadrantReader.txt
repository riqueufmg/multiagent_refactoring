    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ByQuadrantReader depends on a small, focused set of abstractions: com.google.zxing.Reader (delegate), com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap, com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.DecodeHintType, the decoding exceptions (NotFoundException, ChecksumException, FormatException) and java.util.Map. Its behavior is primarily delegating decode calls to the contained Reader and adjusting ResultPoint coordinates (makeAbsolute). There is no evidence of a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies or it acting as a central coupling hub across many unrelated modules, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
