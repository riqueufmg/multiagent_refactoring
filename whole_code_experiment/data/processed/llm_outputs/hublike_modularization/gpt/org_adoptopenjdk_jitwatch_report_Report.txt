    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although Report is widely used (many incoming dependencies) — referenced by numerous classes such as AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker, SuggestionWalker, InliningWalker, ViewerBytecode, MemberComparator, ScoreComparator, EliminatedAllocationRowBean, OptimisedLockRowBean, SuggestionRowBean, InliningRowBean, LinkedBCICell, MemberTableCell and AbstractReportRowBean — it has only a small set of outgoing dependencies. Its fields and API depend primarily on IMetaMember (caller), ReportType (type), Object (metaData), String and primitive types. Because the class does not hold dependencies to a large number of other abstractions (few outgoing relationships) it does not match the Hub-like Modularization smell (which requires many incoming AND many outgoing dependency relationships)."
