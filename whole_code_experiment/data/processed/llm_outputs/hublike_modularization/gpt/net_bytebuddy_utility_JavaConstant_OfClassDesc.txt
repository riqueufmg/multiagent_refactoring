    "justification": "The JavaConstant abstraction (including its nested types Simple, MethodType, MethodHandle and Dynamic) depends on and exposes interactions with a large number of other abstractions across the code base, making it a hub. Examples of outgoing dependencies include: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation and its constant implementations (ClassConstant, IntegerConstant, LongConstant, FloatConstant, DoubleConstant, TextConstant, JavaConstantValue), net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher (and many nested dispatcher interfaces), org.objectweb.asm types (Type, Handle, ConstantDynamic, Opcodes), and core reflection/security APIs (java.lang.reflect.Method, Field, Constructor; java.security.PrivilegedAction). Incoming usage is implied by other core components (e.g. JavaDispatcher and many bytecode/description classes) relying on JavaConstant representations. The number and variety of these bi-directional links (bytecode/ASM, type/description, dispatcher/proxy, reflection, and security plumbing) indicate a hub-like modularization smell: a single abstraction with many incoming and outgoing dependencies."
