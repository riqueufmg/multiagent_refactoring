    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TerminationHandler has a narrow interaction surface: it is an inner enum used only by Appender (field Appender.terminationHandler and Appender.apply calling terminationHandler.of(...)); it defines two enum constants (RETURNING, DROPPING) and a single abstract method of(MethodDescription) that delegates to small set of external types (MethodReturn.of(...), Removal.of(...), and returns StackManipulation). There are few outgoing dependencies (MethodDescription, MethodReturn, Removal, StackManipulation) and essentially one incoming dependency (Appender), so it does not act as a hub with many incoming and outgoing relationships."
