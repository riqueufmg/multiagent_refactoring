    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed VariableDeclaratorContext has only a small number of direct dependencies: VariableDeclarator (wrappedNode), TypeSolver (constructor param), Node (method param/compare), and standard collection types (Collections, List). Its single non-trivial method localVariablesExposedToChild performs a simple check on wrappedNode.getInitializer(). No evidence in the provided code of many incoming dependencies (i.e., many other abstractions depending on this context) or of this class having outgoing dependencies to a large set of different abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization based on the supplied artifacts."
