    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ModifierOrderer depends on a number of utility types (JavaInput, Input.Token/Tok, Tokens.TokenKind, javax.lang.model.element.Modifier, Guava types such as ImmutableList, Ordering, Range, RangeSet, TreeRangeMap, and FormatterException) but these dependencies are cohesive and limited to the single responsibility of locating, representing (ModifierTokens), sorting, and applying replacements for modifiers. The relationships are internal to the formatting task (methods: reorderModifiers, getModifierTokens, asModifier, applyReplacements) and use a small, necessary set of collaborator abstractions. There is no evidence in the class of an unusually large number of incoming/outgoing dependencies or cross-cutting roles that would make it a hub; the inner ModifierTokens is tightly coupled only to ModifierOrderer and token/Modifier types. Therefore this is not a Hub-like Modularization smell."
