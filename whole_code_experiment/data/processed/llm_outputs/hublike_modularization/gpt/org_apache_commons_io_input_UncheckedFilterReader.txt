    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedFilterReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "UncheckedFilterReader has only a small, focused set of dependencies (java.io.FilterReader, java.io.Reader, java.io.IOException, java.io.UncheckedIOException, java.nio.CharBuffer, org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractStreamBuilder, and org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck). Its methods mainly delegate to super implementations and to Uncheck helpers (wrapping IOExceptions), and the nested Builder uses AbstractStreamBuilder and Uncheck. There is no evidence of incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions that would indicate a hub-like modularization smell."
