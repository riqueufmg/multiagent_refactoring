    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The MethodTokenList is a small, narrowly-focused inner class: it extends MethodList.AbstractBase and implements two simple operations (get(int) and size()). Its outgoing dependencies are limited to LazyTypeDescription (enclosing instance) and LazyTypeDescription.MethodToken -> toMethodDescription(...) which returns a MethodDescription.InDefinedShape. There are no signs of it depending on or being referenced by a large number of other abstractions. Key cited elements: MethodTokenList.get(int) -> methodTokens.get(index).toMethodDescription(LazyTypeDescription.this), extends MethodList.AbstractBase, and uses MethodDescription.InDefinedShape. Because its interactions are minimal and localized, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
