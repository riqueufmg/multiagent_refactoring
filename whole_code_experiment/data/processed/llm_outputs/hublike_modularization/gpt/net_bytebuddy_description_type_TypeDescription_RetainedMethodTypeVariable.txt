    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The RetainedMethodTypeVariable implementation is small and narrowly focused. It delegates to a single Generic instance (field 'typeVariable') and invokes a few methods: getUpperBounds().accept(...), getTypeVariableSource(), getSymbol(), and getDeclaredAnnotations(). Its outgoing dependencies are limited to TypeDescription.Generic, TypeList.Generic, TypeVariableSource, AnnotationList and its superclass OfTypeVariable. There is no evidence of numerous incoming/outgoing links to many other abstractions that would qualify it as a hub; it merely wraps/delegates an existing type variable representation."
