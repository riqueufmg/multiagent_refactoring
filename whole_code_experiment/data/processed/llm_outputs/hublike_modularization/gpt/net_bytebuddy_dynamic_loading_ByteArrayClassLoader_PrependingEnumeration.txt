    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.ChildFirst.PrependingEnumeration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PrependingEnumeration has very few dependencies: it references java.net.URL (field nextElement), java.util.Enumeration<URL> (field enumeration) and java.util.NoSuchElementException (throws). Its API surface is minimal (hasMoreElements, nextElement) and it is only instantiated/used by ChildFirst.getResources. There is no evidence of numerous incoming or outgoing dependencies to many other abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
