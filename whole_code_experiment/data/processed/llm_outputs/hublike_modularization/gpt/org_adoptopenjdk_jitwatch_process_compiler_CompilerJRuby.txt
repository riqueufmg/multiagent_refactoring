    "justification": "CompilerJRuby has only a small number of dependencies: it extends AbstractProcess and implements ICompiler (expected inheritance/contract), accepts an ILogListener in its compile method, and uses standard JDK types (File, Path, List, Map, etc.). Incoming usage in the provided relationships is limited (instantiated by LanguageManager). There is no evidence of many incoming and outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions in the provided code, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
