    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The abstraction is acting as a hub: it has many incoming and outgoing dependencies across many concepts and modules. Evidence in this code: the Dispatcher.OfMethodTypeDesc proxy interface is one of several JavaDispatcher.Proxied dispatchers (CLASS_DESC, METHOD_TYPE_DESC, METHOD_HANDLE_DESC, DIRECT_METHOD_HANDLE_DESC, DYNAMIC_CONSTANT_DESC) referenced from JavaConstant.Simple and used by multiple nested types (Simple, MethodType, MethodHandle, Dynamic). The surrounding JavaConstant implementation repeatedly calls JavaDispatcher.of(Dispatcher.OfMethodTypeDesc.class) and METHOD_TYPE_DESC.parameterArray / METHOD_TYPE_DESC.returnType in many places (e.g., MethodType.ofDescription, Simple.ofDescription, Dynamic.ofDescription), showing outgoing dependencies to java.lang.constant method-type descriptors and related types. The abstraction also interacts with many other abstractions: TypePool/TypeDescription/Type (org.objectweb.asm.Type), MethodHandle, ConstantDynamic, ClassFileLocator, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, JavaDispatcher, JavaType and various net.bytebuddy.* classes. This concentrated, bidirectional coupling to many different components (type descriptors, dispatchers, ASM types, type pools, method/field descriptions, and other utility dispatchers) indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
