    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.UncheckedExecutionException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very few dependencies: it extends a single superclass org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.UncheckedException, uses java.lang.Throwable as the constructor parameter type, and mentions java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException only in Javadoc. There are no many incoming or outgoing dependencies, no calls to multiple other abstractions, and the class contains a single simple constructor. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
