    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.BytecodeLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "BytecodeLoader depends on a large number of other abstractions (incoming and outgoing): it imports/uses BCParamConstant, BCParamNumeric, BCParamString, BCParamSwitch, BytecodeInstruction, ClassBC, ExceptionTableEntry, IBytecodeParam, InnerClassRelationship, LineTableEntry, MemberBytecode, Opcode, SourceMapper, JavapProcess, ReflectionJavap, StringUtil, Logger/LoggerFactory and many JITWatchConstants. It constructs and manipulates many domain objects (ClassBC, MemberBytecode, BytecodeInstruction, ExceptionTableEntry, LineTableEntry, InnerClassRelationship, BCParam*), contains numerous responsibilities (fetching bytecode via reflection or process, parsing multiple bytecode sections, building generics mapping, storing line/exception tables, parameter processing) and central control logic (section switching, parse pipeline). The class is large, heavily connected and flagged by an in-code TODO to refactor, indicating it is acting as a hub for bytecode-loading functionality rather than a single cohesive abstraction."
