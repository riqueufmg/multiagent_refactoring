    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.AbstractFormatCache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AbstractFormatCache has a small, well-scoped set of dependencies (mostly JDK types and a few helper classes) rather than a large number of incoming/outgoing relationships. Outgoing dependencies visible in the code include java.text.DateFormat/SimpleDateFormat/Format, java.util.Locale/TimeZone, java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap, java.util.Arrays/Objects and the helper classes LocaleUtils (used in getPatternForStyle and getDateTimeInstance) and TimeZones (used in getInstance). Incoming usage in the provided corpus is limited (FastDateFormat builds a single CACHE anonymous subclass and calls CACHE methods). The class is a focused cache/factory abstraction (methods: getPatternForStyle, getInstance, getDateTimeInstance, createInstance) and acts as a cohesive utility rather than a hub with many independent modules depending on it. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
