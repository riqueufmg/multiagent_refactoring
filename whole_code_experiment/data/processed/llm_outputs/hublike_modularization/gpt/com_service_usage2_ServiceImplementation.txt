    "class": "com.service.usage2.ServiceImplementation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ServiceImplementation only implements a single interface (ServiceDefinition) and contains no other incoming or outgoing dependencies. The class has a single trivial method getValue() and does not reference or be referenced by a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
