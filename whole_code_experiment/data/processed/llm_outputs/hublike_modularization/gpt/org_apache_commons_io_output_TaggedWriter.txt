    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.TaggedWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TaggedWriter has only a small number of dependencies: it extends ProxyWriter, uses java.io.Writer/IOException/Serializable/UUID, and interacts with a single project class org.apache.commons.io.TaggedIOException (calls TaggedIOException.isTaggedWith and TaggedIOException.throwCauseIfTaggedWith, and constructs TaggedIOException in handleIOException). There is no evidence in the provided code of many incoming or outgoing dependencies (no large dependency graph, only a couple of external types and one internal helper class), so it does not qualify as a hub-like module."
