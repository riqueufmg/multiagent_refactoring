    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SimplePathVisitor has a small, focused set of dependencies (java.nio.file.Path, SimpleFileVisitor, FileVisitResult, IOException, java.util.Objects, org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractSupplier, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiFunction, and PathVisitor) and only a few direct incoming relationships in the provided code (its nested AbstractBuilder and a subclass CountingPathVisitor/its builders). The class acts as a focused visitor abstraction with builder support rather than a central hub connected to a large number of otherwise unrelated abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
