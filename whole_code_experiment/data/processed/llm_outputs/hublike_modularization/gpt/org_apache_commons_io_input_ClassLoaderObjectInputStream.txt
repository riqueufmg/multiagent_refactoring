    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ClassLoaderObjectInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small, focused set of outgoing dependencies on core Java types (ObjectInputStream, ClassLoader, InputStream, ObjectStreamClass, Proxy, Class, StreamCorruptedException, IllegalArgumentException) to implement a specific responsibility (loading classes via a given ClassLoader). There is no evidence in the analyzed code of a large number of incoming dependencies or of the class acting as a central coordinator for many other abstractions. Its behavior is narrow (overriding resolveClass and resolveProxyClass and delegating to super or the provided ClassLoader), so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
