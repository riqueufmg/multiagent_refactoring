    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.DeferredFileOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DeferredFileOutputStream has several outgoing dependencies (e.g. java.nio.file.Files, java.nio.file.Path, java.io.File, java.io.OutputStream, java.io.InputStream, java.io.IOException, java.util.Objects, java.util.function.Supplier, org.apache.commons.io.output.AbstractByteArrayOutputStream / ByteArrayOutputStream, org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractStreamBuilder, org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils, and its superclass ThresholdingOutputStream). However, the number of distinct dependencies is moderate and expected for a stream that manages in-memory and on-disk storage. There is no evidence in the provided analysis of a large number of incoming dependencies (few or no other abstractions depend on this class), and the class responsibilities are cohesive (memory vs disk buffering, temporary file handling). Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
