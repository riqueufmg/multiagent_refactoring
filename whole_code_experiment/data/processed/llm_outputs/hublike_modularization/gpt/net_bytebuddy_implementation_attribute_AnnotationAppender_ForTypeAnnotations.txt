    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The ForTypeAnnotations nested class acts as a central coordinator between many different abstractions: it holds references to and invokes methods on AnnotationAppender and AnnotationValueFilter (fields: annotationAppender, annotationValueFilter, and multiple calls to annotationAppender.append/apply). It extensively depends on the type system abstractions (TypeDescription.Generic and its Visitor interface, TypeList, TypeReference, TypePath), descriptor/value abstractions (AnnotationDescription, MethodDescription.InDefinedShape, EnumerationDescription), and multiple ASM visitor types (org.objectweb.asm.AnnotationVisitor, ClassVisitor, FieldVisitor, MethodVisitor, RecordComponentVisitor). It exposes many static factory methods (ofSuperClass, ofInterfaceType, ofFieldType, ofMethodReturnType, ofMethodParameterType, ofExceptionType, ofReceiverType, ofTypeVariable, etc.) that tie it to diverse type usages and to TypeReference construction utilities (TypeReference.newTypeParameterReference, newFormalParameterReference, newExceptionReference, newTypeReference). Its behavior traverses and delegates across many different abstractions (accepting/visiting many Generic sorts: onGenericArray, onWildcard, onParameterizedType, onTypeVariable, onNonGenericType and calling apply to write annotations). Because it has both numerous outgoing dependencies (invoking many external APIs) and serves as a focal incoming integration point for different parts of the type/annotation writing subsystem, it exhibits the hub-like modularization smell."
