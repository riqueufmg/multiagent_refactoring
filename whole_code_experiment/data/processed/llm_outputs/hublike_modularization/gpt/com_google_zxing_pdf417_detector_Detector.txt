    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Detector has a focused responsibility (locating PDF417 barcodes) and depends on a small, reasonable set of abstractions: BinaryBitmap (input), BitMatrix (manipulated), PDF417DetectorResult (return type), ResultPoint (coordinates), NotFoundException/DecodeHintType (error/hints), and standard collections/arrays. Its internal methods (applyRotation, findVertices, findRowsWithPattern, findGuardPattern, patternMatchVariance) are private and operate on these types. Incoming usage is limited (shown use from com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Reader). There is no large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicative of a hub; dependencies are few and cohesive, so this is not a Hub-like Modularization smell."
