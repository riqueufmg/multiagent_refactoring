    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RenamingPlugin.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The NoOp enum only implements the nested Renaming interface and defines a single INSTANCE plus a trivial apply(String name) method that returns the input. (See: 'enum NoOp implements Renaming', 'INSTANCE', and 'public String apply(String name) { return name; }'.) It references only java.lang.String and its enclosing Renaming type and has no fields, no additional methods, and no uses of many other abstractions. Therefore there is no evidence of incoming/outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions required for a hub-like modularization smell."
