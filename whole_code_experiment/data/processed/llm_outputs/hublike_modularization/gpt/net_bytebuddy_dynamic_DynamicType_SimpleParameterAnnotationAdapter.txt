    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SimpleParameterAnnotationAdapter is a small, private inner adapter that only interacts with a handful of types (ParameterDescription.Token, AnnotationDescription, MethodDescription.Token, MethodDefinitionAdapter). Its methods (annotateParameter, materialize) only create new tokens/adapters and return local builder/adapters. It is not referenced as a central connector across many modules nor does it hold incoming/outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
