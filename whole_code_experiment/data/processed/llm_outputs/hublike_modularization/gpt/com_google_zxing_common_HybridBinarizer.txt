    "justification": "HybridBinarizer depends on a small, focused set of abstractions: GlobalHistogramBinarizer (superclass), com.google.zxing.LuminanceSource, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.Binarizer (factory method), and NotFoundException. All interactions are directly related to image luminance retrieval and BitMatrix thresholding (methods getBlackMatrix, calculateBlackPoints, thresholdBlock, calculateThresholdForBlock). It is final and encapsulates its responsibilities with several private static helpers and a single cached BitMatrix field. There is no evidence of incoming/outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions that would indicate a hub-like modularization smell."
