    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ReedSolomonEncoder has only a small number of domain dependencies: it uses GenericGF and GenericGFPoly (outgoing) and standard library types (List/ArrayList, arrays). Within the provided codebase it is referenced by Encoder (com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.Encoder) to generate check words (incoming). There is no evidence of incoming or outgoing dependencies with a large number of different abstractions — the in-degree and out-degree are low (1 known incoming, ~2 domain outgoing), so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
