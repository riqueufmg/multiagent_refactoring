    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MethodComparator has a small, focused set of dependencies: it uses java.lang.reflect.Method and java.util.Comparator and creates instances of ParameterComparator and ClassComparator (new ParameterComparator(), new ClassComparator()) to compare parameter types and return types. Incoming uses in the provided code are limited (e.g. ReflectionClassDeclaration and ReflectionRecordDeclaration call .sorted(new MethodComparator())). There is no evidence of dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (neither many outgoing collaborators nor many incoming clients) so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
