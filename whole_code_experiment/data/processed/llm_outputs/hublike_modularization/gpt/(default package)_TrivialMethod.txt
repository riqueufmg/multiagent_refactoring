    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TrivialMethod does not act as a hub: its interactions are limited to internal methods/field (getCount, incCount, count) and a small number of JDK classes used locally (java.lang.StringBuilder, java.lang.System). There are no incoming/outgoing dependencies with a large number of distinct abstractions, so Hub-like Modularization is not present."
