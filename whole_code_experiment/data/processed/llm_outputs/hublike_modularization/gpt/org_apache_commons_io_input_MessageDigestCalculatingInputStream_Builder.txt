    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.MessageDigestCalculatingInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small, focused set of dependencies rather than acting as a hub. Outgoing dependencies: extends ObservableInputStream, uses java.security.MessageDigest (and MessageDigest.getInstance / Provider), java.io.InputStream, inner Builder and inner MessageDigestMaintainingObserver (which extends Observer), java.util.Arrays, java.util.Objects, and standard exceptions (IOException, NoSuchAlgorithmException). There is no evidence in the analyzed code of a large number of incoming/outgoing links to many other abstractions — dependencies are limited and cohesive to the message-digest responsibility. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
