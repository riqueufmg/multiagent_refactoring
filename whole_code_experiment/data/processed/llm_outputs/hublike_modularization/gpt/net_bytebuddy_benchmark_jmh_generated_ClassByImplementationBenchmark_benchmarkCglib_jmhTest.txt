    "detection": true,
    "justification": "This class depends on a large number of disparate abstractions (many org.openjdk.jmh.* types and java.util types) and coordinates among them, acting as a hub. Evidence: extensive imports and usages of InfraControl, BenchmarkParams, IterationParams, ThreadParams, Control, Blackhole, RawResults, SampleBuffer, BenchmarkTaskResult, ThroughputResult, AverageTimeResult, SampleTimeResult, SingleShotResult, ResultRole, ScalarResult, AggregationPolicy and other JMH types; fields referencing multiple framework types (benchmarkParams, iterationParams, threadParams, notifyControl, blackhole, startRndMask, f_classbyimplementationbenchmark0_0); and many methods that orchestrate flows between these types (benchmarkCglib_Throughput, benchmarkCglib_AverageTime, benchmarkCglib_SampleTime, benchmarkCglib_SingleShotTime and their stubs). These many incoming/outgoing interactions indicate a hub-like modularization smell."
