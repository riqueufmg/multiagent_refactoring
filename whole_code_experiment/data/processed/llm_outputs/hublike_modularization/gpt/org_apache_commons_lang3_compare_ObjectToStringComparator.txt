    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.compare.ObjectToStringComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only a small number of dependencies: it implements Comparator<Object> and Serializable and uses java.lang.Object and java.lang.String (toString and compareTo). It is stateless, final, and self-contained (single INSTANCE), with no incoming/outgoing relationships to a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
