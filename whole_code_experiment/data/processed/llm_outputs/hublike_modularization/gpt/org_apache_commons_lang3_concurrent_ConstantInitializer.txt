    "detection": false,
    "justification": "False. ConstantInitializer has only a small number of dependencies: it implements ConcurrentInitializer<T>, imports java.util.Objects, declares that get() throws ConcurrentException, and uses standard-library facilities (String.format, System.identityHashCode, Integer.valueOf). There is no evidence in the provided code of incoming and outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions (no many distinct classes/packages referenced or depending on it), so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
