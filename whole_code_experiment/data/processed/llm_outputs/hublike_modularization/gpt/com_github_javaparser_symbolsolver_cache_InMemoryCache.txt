    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.cache.InMemoryCache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "InMemoryCache does not exhibit hub-like modularization. Outgoing dependencies are limited to a small set of interfaces and JDK types (implements com.github.javaparser.resolution.cache.Cache<K,V>, references CacheStats/DefaultCacheStats, java.util.Map, Optional, WeakHashMap, Collections). Incoming dependencies in the provided code are minimal — the only shown consumer is com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.CombinedTypeSolver (which uses InMemoryCache.create()). There is no evidence of the class having dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, so the hub smell is not present."
