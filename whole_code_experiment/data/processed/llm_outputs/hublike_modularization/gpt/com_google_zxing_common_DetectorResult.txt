    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.DetectorResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DetectorResult is a simple data holder with only two outgoing dependencies (BitMatrix and ResultPoint). It provides only a constructor and two getters and does not itself depend on many abstractions. While it has several incoming usages (MultiDetector, QRCodeMultiReader, QRCodeReader, DataMatrixReader) these are expected consumers of a small DTO returned by detection logic. The class neither aggregates many outgoing collaborators nor implements extensive logic that creates bidirectional coupling with many modules, so it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
