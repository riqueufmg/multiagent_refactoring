    "detection": true,
    "justification": "CameraManager acts as a central hub with many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Outgoing dependencies (it directly uses) include: CameraConfigurationManager (field + calls to initFromCameraParameters, setDesiredCameraParameters), OpenCamera / OpenCameraInterface (opening and wrapping android.hardware.Camera), AutoFocusManager (field, start/stop/use in setTorch/startPreview/stopPreview), PreviewCallback (field, requestPreviewFrame interaction), and PlanarYUVLuminanceSource (buildLuminanceSource factory). It also manipulates android.hardware.Camera and Camera.Parameters extensively (openDriver, setDesiredCameraParameters). Incoming dependencies (classes that use CameraManager) include CaptureActivity and CaptureActivityHandler (create and call startPreview, requestPreviewFrame, openDriver/closeDriver), ViewfinderView (calls getFramingRect()/getFramingRectInPreview), AmbientLightManager (calls setTorch), and other components (DecodeThread/Decode handler flow via PreviewCallback). Methods like openDriver, startPreview, stopPreview, setTorch, requestPreviewFrame, getFramingRect/getFramingRectInPreview and buildLuminanceSource demonstrate that CameraManager coordinates camera lifecycle, UI framing, autofocus, preview callbacks, and decoding preparation, indicating high coupling to many abstractions and therefore a hub-like modularization smell."
