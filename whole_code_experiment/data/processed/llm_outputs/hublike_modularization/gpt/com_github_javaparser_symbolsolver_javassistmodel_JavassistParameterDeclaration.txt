    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JavassistParameterDeclaration has only a small, well-defined set of dependencies: it implements ResolvedParameterDeclaration and references ResolvedType (field and getType()), TypeSolver (field and constructor), JavassistFactory (constructor call to typeUsageFor) and javassist.CtClass (constructor parameter). There is no evidence in the analyzed code of incoming/outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the class acts as a simple wrapper for parameter information rather than a hub. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
