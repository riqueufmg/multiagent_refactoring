    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Nodes has a small set of outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.nodes.Node / Element, and standard Java collections and functional interfaces) as seen in its methods (e.g., Validate usage in set/wrap, StringUtil.join in outerHtml, Node operations in remove/before/after). Incoming dependencies are limited in the provided code: org.jsoup.nodes.Element exposes selectNodes/selectFirstNode that return Nodes, and org.jsoup.select.Collector.collectNodes produces Nodes. This number of incoming and outgoing relationships is small and focused; Nodes does not act as a hub with many dependencies to/from a large number of other abstractions, so Hub-like Modularization is not detected."
