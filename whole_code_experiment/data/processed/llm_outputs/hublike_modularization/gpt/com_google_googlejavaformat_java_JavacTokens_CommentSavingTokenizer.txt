    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavacTokens",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although JavacTokens depends on many external types (outgoing dependencies) — e.g. com.sun.tools.javac.parser.JavaTokenizer, Scanner, ScannerFactory, Tokens.Comment, Tokens.Token, Tokens.TokenKind, com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList (and its toImmutableList), com.google.common.base.Preconditions, com.sun.tools.javac.util.Context, and java.util collections (HashMap, Map, Set) — the provided code does not show a large number of incoming dependencies from many other abstractions. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing couplings. Here we only have clear evidence of multiple outgoing dependencies; there is no evidence in the input that JavacTokens is a central hub depended on by a large number of other modules. Therefore the hub-like smell is not detected."
