    "justification": "CharSequenceInputStream does not act as a hub: its outgoing dependencies are limited and cohesive (uses java.nio classes ByteBuffer/CharBuffer, java.nio.charset types Charset/CharsetEncoder/CoderResult/CodingErrorAction, and a small set of library helpers: org.apache.commons.io.Charsets, org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, org.apache.commons.io.charset.CharsetEncoders, org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractStreamBuilder via the nested Builder, and org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck). It delegates a single well-scoped responsibility (encode a CharSequence to bytes) and even reuses ReaderInputStream.checkMinBufferSize for buffer-size validation. There is no evidence in the provided code of a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies across many unrelated abstractions, so this class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
