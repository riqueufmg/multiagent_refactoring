    "class": "japa.bdd.samples.JavaConcepts",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has hub-like modularization: it depends on a large number of other abstractions and many inner/related types depend on it. Outgoing dependencies include: JavaParser, japa.parser.ParseException, com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, File, InputStream, ByteArrayInputStream, IOException, List, LinkedList, ArrayList, Map, Comparator, Integer, String, System, Class, primitives/arrays, annotations (Ignore, Deprecated), and many Java standard types (Serializable, Cloneable). It also extends Base and calls Base.check2. Incoming/internal dependents include multiple inner classes and enums that extend or reference the outer class (QWE extends JavaConcepts<List<int[]>,String>, inner classes Y/X reference JavaConcepts.this, many enums and nested types inside the class). The class exposes public/static fields and constructors (public static JavaConcepts t; public constructors, main) used across nested types. The combination of numerous distinct type references across imports, fields, method signatures, exceptions, generics, anonymous classes, and many nested/inner types that instantiate/extend/reference it indicates a hub-like module with many incoming and outgoing dependencies."
