    "class": "com.google.zxing.MultiFormatWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "MultiFormatWriter exhibits Hub-like Modularization because it has outgoing dependencies on a large number of concrete writer abstractions and acts as a central factory that clients depend on. Evidence of many outgoing dependencies: it imports and instantiates numerous specific writers (AztecWriter, DataMatrixWriter, CodaBarWriter, Code128Writer, Code39Writer, Code93Writer, EAN13Writer, EAN8Writer, ITFWriter, UPCAWriter, UPCEWriter, PDF417Writer, QRCodeWriter). The encode(...) method contains a switch over BarcodeFormat with many cases mapping to those distinct writer types (EAN_8, UPC_E, EAN_13, UPC_A, QR_CODE, CODE_39, CODE_93, CODE_128, ITF, PDF_417, CODABAR, DATA_MATRIX, AZTEC). It also implements the Writer interface (an incoming abstraction relationship) and is designed as a single factory entry point for encoding many formats, implying many clients will depend on this class. The combination of numerous outgoing links to concrete writers and its role as the central factory (incoming client dependencies via the Writer API) justifies flagging this class as a hub-like modularization smell."
