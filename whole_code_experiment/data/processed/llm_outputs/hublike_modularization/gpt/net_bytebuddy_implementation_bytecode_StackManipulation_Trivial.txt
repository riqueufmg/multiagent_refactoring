    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation.Trivial",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StackManipulation.Trivial is a tiny canonical no-op implementation that is referenced from many places (incoming dependencies) but has very few outgoing dependencies. Examples of incoming dependencies: StackManipulation.Compound constructor filters out Trivial instances; Implementation.Context.Default.FieldGetterDelegation uses StackManipulation.Trivial.INSTANCE for static field reads; Implementation.Context.Default.FieldSetterDelegation and AccessorMethodDelegation use Trivial via composed StackManipulation. Many Implementation.* classes construct Compound/Compound.Composable sequences that may encounter Trivial. Outgoing dependencies are minimal: Trivial.apply() calls StackSize.ZERO.toIncreasingSize() (dependency on StackSize and StackManipulation.Size) and it implements StackManipulation. Because Trivial has many incoming references but only a small number of outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the definition of Hub-like Modularization (which requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions)."
