    "class": "(default package).HotThrow",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "HotThrow has only a small number of dependencies (java.util.Random, StringBuilder, String, System and primitive/array types) and does not interact with many other abstractions. There is no evidence of large incoming or outgoing coupling to many different classes or modules (no multiple collaborators or usages across the codebase shown), so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
