    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The abstraction both depends on and is depended upon by many other abstractions. Outgoing dependencies: its core API and inner types reference numerous distinct abstractions such as org.objectweb.asm.MethodVisitor (apply(MethodVisitor,...)), net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, ParameterDescription, ParameterList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, AnnotationAppender, AnnotationValueFilter and matcher utilities (ElementMatchers). Incoming dependencies: other major components implement or use MethodAttributeAppender (e.g. net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin implements MethodAttributeAppender and MethodAttributeAppender.Factory and calls attribute(this) in apply(...)), and AnnotationAppender-related visitors are composed with MethodAttributeAppender implementations (ForInstrumentedMethod, Explicit, ForReceiverType, Compound). The interface also contains many nested implementations and factories (NoOp, Factory.Compound, ForInstrumentedMethod, Explicit.Target, ForReceiverType, Compound) that further couple it to many modules. This high number of both incoming and outgoing links indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
