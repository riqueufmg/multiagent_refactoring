    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.cache.DefaultCacheStats",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DefaultCacheStats has only a small number of dependencies: it implements com.github.javaparser.resolution.cache.CacheStats (one obvious incoming/outgoing relationship), uses two static methods from com.google.common.math.LongMath (saturatedAdd, saturatedSubtract), and java.util.Arrays for hashCode. There is no evidence in the analyzed code of many incoming or outgoing links to a large number of other abstractions. The class is cohesive (encapsulates cache statistics behavior) and its dependency surface is minimal, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
