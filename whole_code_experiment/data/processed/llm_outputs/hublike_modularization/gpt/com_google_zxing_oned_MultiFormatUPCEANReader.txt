    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.MultiFormatUPCEANReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are numerous: the class imports and directly uses UPCEANReader and concrete readers (EAN13Reader, UPCAReader, EAN8Reader, UPCEReader), core types (BarcodeFormat, DecodeHintType, Result, BitArray, Map, Collection), and exception/reader types (NotFoundException, ReaderException, Reader). These show it coordinates many other abstractions. However, there is no evidence in the provided code that MultiFormatUPCEANReader itself has a large number of incoming dependencies (no other classes in the given set reference or depend on it). Because the hub smell requires both many incoming and outgoing dependencies, this class does not meet the full criteria for Hub-like Modularization based on the provided artifacts."
