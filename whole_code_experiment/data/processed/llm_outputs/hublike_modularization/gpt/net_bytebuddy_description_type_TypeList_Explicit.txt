    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeList.Explicit has a very small and focused surface: it stores a List<? extends TypeDescription> and implements get(int), size(), and a single static factory of(List<? extends JavaConstant>) that converts JavaConstant -> TypeDescription. Its external dependencies are limited to TypeDescription, JavaConstant and standard collection utilities (List, ArrayList, Arrays). It does not reference or depend on a large number of different abstractions nor act as a central connector between many modules, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
