    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TextParsedResult has a very small set of dependencies: it extends ParsedResult and references the ParsedResultType enum (super(ParsedResultType.TEXT)) and uses standard java.lang.String for its fields (text, language). There is no evidence in the provided code of many incoming or outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
