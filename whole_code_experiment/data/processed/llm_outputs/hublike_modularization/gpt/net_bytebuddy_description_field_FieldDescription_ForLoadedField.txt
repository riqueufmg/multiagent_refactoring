    "detection": true,
    "justification": "FieldDescription (and its nested ForLoadedField implementation) exhibits hub-like modularization: the abstraction depends on — and is referenced by — many other abstractions across modules. Evidence of high coupling/outgoing dependencies: methods and fields in ForLoadedField reference java.lang.reflect.Field, TypeDescription.ForLoadedType and TypeDescription.Generic (TypeDescription.Generic.LazyProjection.ForLoadedFieldType), AnnotationList.ForLoadedAnnotations, AnnotationDescription, ElementMatcher, org.objectweb.asm.SignatureWriter/Opcodes and net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin (annotations). Evidence of many incoming links / central role: the FieldDescription interface defines many nested types (InGenericShape, InDefinedShape, AbstractBase, Latent, TypeSubstituting, Token, SignatureToken) used throughout net.bytebuddy.description.type (TypeDescription, TypeDescription.Generic), net.bytebuddy.description.annotation (AnnotationList, AnnotationDescription), net.bytebuddy.description.method/field lists, and build/plugin code. The volume and variety of dependencies (reflection, type/annotation descriptions, ASM signature machinery, build/plugin utilities) show this abstraction acts as a hub connecting many subsystems, indicating a Hub-like Modularization smell."
