    "justification": "The ByteBuddyTransformationConfiguration class interacts with a small, focused set of abstractions rather than acting as a central hub. Its fields and direct dependencies are: Project, Configuration, Provider<ByteBuddyAndroidService>, and FileCollection. Its single method (invoke) configures a ByteBuddyInstrumentationParameters instance by calling ByteBuddyViewConfiguration.toClassPath(project, configuration), project.getExtensions().getByType(BaseExtension.class).getBootClasspath(), and setting the provider and runtime classpath. These are a handful of well-scoped collaborators (ByteBuddyInstrumentationParameters, ByteBuddyViewConfiguration, BaseExtension) and not a large number of incoming/outgoing dependencies across the system, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
