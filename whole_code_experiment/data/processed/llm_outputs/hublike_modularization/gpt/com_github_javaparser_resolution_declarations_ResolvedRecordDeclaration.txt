    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ResolvedRecordDeclaration has a small, focused set of dependencies: it extends ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ResolvedTypeParametrizable and HasAccessSpecifier, and its API references a few types (Optional<ResolvedReferenceType>, List<ResolvedReferenceType>, List<ResolvedConstructorDeclaration>, plus standard types like Optional and List). Its default methods are simple (isRecord(), asRecord()). There is no evidence in the provided code of a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies implicating it as a central hub. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
