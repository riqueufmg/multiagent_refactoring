    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Evaluator abstraction acts as a central hub: it declares a large number of tightly coupled nested evaluator types (e.g. Tag, Id, Class, Attribute, AttributeWithValue*, IndexLessThan/IndexGreaterThan/IndexEquals, CssNthEvaluator and its IsNth*/IsNthLast* subclasses, ContainsText/ContainsOwnText/ContainsWholeOwnText, Matches/MatchesOwn/MatchesWholeOwnText, MatchText, etc.), and directly depends on many unrelated classes from other packages (org.jsoup.nodes.*: Element, Node, LeafNode, TextNode, PseudoTextElement, Document, DocumentType, XmlDeclaration; org.jsoup.parser.ParseSettings; org.jsoup.helper.Regex/Validate; org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer/StringUtil; java.util.function.Predicate, java.util.List, java.util.regex.Pattern). The class both aggregates many outgoing dependencies (uses many node and helper classes throughout its nested evaluators) and serves many incoming dependents (it is the central evaluator type used by selector machinery as noted in the class doc and by many selector implementations). The concentration of many different responsibilities and links to many other abstractions indicates a Hub-like Modularization smell."
