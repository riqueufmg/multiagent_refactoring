    "justification": "The interface exposes a single method (traverseScope()) and only references two other types: java.util.Optional and com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression. It is a small unifying abstraction (for NodeWithScope and NodeWithOptionalScope) with no evidence in this file of many incoming or outgoing dependencies. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
