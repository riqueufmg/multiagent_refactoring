    "justification": "The analyzed abstraction does not act as a hub: InnerClassDotExpressions only depends on a small, hierarchical set of nested classes (InnerClassContainer.InnerClass, InnerClassContainer.InnerClass.InnerInnerClass, InnerClassContainer.InnerClass.InnerInnerClass.InnerInnerInnerClass). There are no many incoming or outgoing dependencies with a large number of distinct abstractions; coupling is limited to this single nested containment chain."
