    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeReferenceAdjustment.TypeReferenceClassVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The TypeReferenceClassVisitor acts as a central hub: it depends on and coordinates many distinct abstractions across multiple packages. Evidence of broad outgoing dependencies includes heavy use of ASM types (org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor, AnnotationVisitor, FieldVisitor, MethodVisitor, RecordComponentVisitor, Type, TypePath, Handle, ConstantDynamic, Label, TypeReference), Byte Buddy core types (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool and TypePool.Resolution, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader), and many description/implementation classes (FieldDescription, MethodList, FieldList, Implementation.Context references in its factory method). It both consumes TypePool resolutions and invokes TypeDescription APIs (isNestedClass, getInternalName, isMemberType, getDeclaringType, getSimpleName, getModifiers, getEnclosingType) to emit inner-class attributes. It also exposes many inner visitor classes (TypeReferenceAnnotationVisitor, TypeReferenceFieldVisitor, TypeReferenceMethodVisitor) that themselves interact with many ASM and Byte Buddy types (Type, Handle, ConstantDynamic, AnnotationValue resolution). The class collects and mediates information between bytecode-level ASM abstractions and high-level TypePool/TypeDescription abstractions, creating numerous incoming and outgoing relationships. This concentration of cross-cutting responsibilities and many dependencies indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
