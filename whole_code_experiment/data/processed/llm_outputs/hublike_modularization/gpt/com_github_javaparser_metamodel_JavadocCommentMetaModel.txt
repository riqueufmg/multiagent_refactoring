    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JavadocCommentMetaModel has only a small set of direct dependencies: it extends CommentMetaModel and its constructors reference Optional<BaseNodeMetaModel>, Node (via Class<? extends Node>), and JavadocComment.class. It is instantiated as JavaParserMetaModel.javadocCommentMetaModel and is referenced by a few closely related meta-models (e.g. TraditionalJavadocCommentMetaModel and MarkdownCommentMetaModel via Optional.of(javadocCommentMetaModel), and a constructor-parameter registration javadocCommentMetaModel.getConstructorParameters().add(commentMetaModel.contentPropertyMetaModel)). These are a few, tightly related links rather than incoming/outgoing dependencies with a large number of disparate abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
