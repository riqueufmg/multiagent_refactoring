    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.SMSTOMMSTOResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SMSTOMMSTOResultParser has only a small number of dependencies: it extends ResultParser (inherited behavior), accepts a com.google.zxing.Result as input (parse signature / getMassagedText uses), and constructs/returns com.google.zxing.client.result.SMSParsedResult. The parse method performs local string processing and does not reference or coordinate with a large set of other abstractions. There are no many incoming/outgoing dependency links to numerous classes, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
