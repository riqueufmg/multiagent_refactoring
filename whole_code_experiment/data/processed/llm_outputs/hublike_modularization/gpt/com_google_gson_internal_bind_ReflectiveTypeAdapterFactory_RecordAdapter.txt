    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory.RecordAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "RecordAdapter has many incoming and outgoing dependencies indicating a hub-like role. Outgoing dependencies: ReflectionHelper (getCanonicalRecordConstructor, makeAccessible, getRecordComponentNames, constructorToString), java.lang.reflect.Constructor (newInstance, getParameterTypes), java.util.Map / java.util.HashMap (componentIndices, primitive defaults), java.util.Arrays (toString, array operations), BoundField (readIntoArray, fieldName), FieldsData (passed from factory), JsonReader (reading values), primitive wrapper types and defaults, and many exception types (IllegalAccessException, InstantiationException, InvocationTargetException). Incoming dependencies: created and returned by ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory.create(...) when handling record classes and used via the Adapter<T,A> abstraction (the factory and outer class rely on this adapter). The class coordinates construction, reflection access checks, mapping of record component names to constructor indices, and exception handling across many other abstractions in the library, which qualifies it as a hub-like module."
