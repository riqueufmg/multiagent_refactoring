    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The TypeWriter abstraction (and its Default/ForInlining/ForCreation specializations) acts as a central hub: it declares many nested collaborator interfaces (FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool) and a deep nested hierarchy of Record/Record.ForDefinedMethod/WithBody/WithoutBody/AccessBridgeWrapper, etc. It depends on a large number of external abstractions across packages (e.g. net.bytebuddy.description.* types, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.* types, net.bytebuddy.implementation.*, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor/MethodVisitor/ClassWriter/ClassReader, AsmClassReader/AsmClassWriter, TypePool, ClassFileLocator, AnnotationValueFilter.Factory, Implementation.Context.Factory, AuxiliaryType.NamingStrategy and many more). Methods and responsibilities (make, wrap, create, extensive inner classes like RedefinitionClassVisitor, DecorationClassVisitor, ImplementationContextClassVisitor, ClassDumpAction.Dispatcher) show both many incoming and outgoing connections: it composes/uses MethodPool/FieldPool records, coordinates ASM visitors and class readers/writers, registers and drains Implementation.Context, and writes auxiliary types. This concentration of numerous distinct dependencies and responsibilities indicates a hub-like modularization smell where this abstraction is a central coupling point for many modules."
