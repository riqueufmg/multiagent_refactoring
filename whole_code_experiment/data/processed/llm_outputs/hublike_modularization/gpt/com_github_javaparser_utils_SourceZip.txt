    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SourceZip has several outgoing dependencies (uses JavaParser, ParserConfiguration, ParseResult<CompilationUnit>, Providers.provider, ParseStart.COMPILATION_UNIT, Utils.assertNotNull, Log, Pair, Paths/Path, ZipFile/ZipEntry, Collections/ArrayList/List), but there is no evidence in the provided code that many other abstractions depend on SourceZip (no large number of incoming dependencies). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires both many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here only outgoing dependencies are numerous while incoming dependencies are not present in the analyzed set, so the smell is not detected."
