    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MemberInterface is an empty member interface declared inside TypeWithMemberType. The source contains no methods, fields, extends/implements clauses, or references to other types; there are no incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
