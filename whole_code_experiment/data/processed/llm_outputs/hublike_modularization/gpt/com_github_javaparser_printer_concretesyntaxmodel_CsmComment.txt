    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CsmComment has a very small and focused set of dependencies: it references Comment, Node, SourcePrinter and implements CsmElement. Its outgoing interactions are limited to calling SourcePrinter methods (normalizeEolInTextBlock, print, println) and reading Comment content/header/footer via process(...) and prettyPrint(...). The only shown incoming usage in the provided code is CsmOrphanCommentsEnding calling CsmComment.process(...). There is no evidence of dependencies to or from a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
