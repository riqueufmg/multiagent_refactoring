    "detection": true,
    "justification": "MultipleParentClassLoader acts as a central hub that connects to an unbounded number of other ClassLoader abstractions. Evidence: (1) Field 'private final List<? extends ClassLoader> parents' holds many parent ClassLoader instances. (2) Methods iterate over that list to delegate behavior to each parent: loadClass(String, boolean) loops parents and calls parent.loadClass(...); getResource(String) loops parents and calls parent.getResource(...); getResources(String) collects parent.getResources(...) results into a list. (3) getResources returns a CompoundEnumeration that itself aggregates a List<Enumeration<URL>> and iterates them, further centralizing multiple sources. (4) The nested Builder class provides many append/appendMostSpecific/filter methods to collect arbitrary numbers of ClassLoader instances and ultimately constructs a MultipleParentClassLoader (doBuild), demonstrating many incoming links from callers collecting diverse class loaders. These elements show the class has both many outgoing dependencies (delegations to many parents/enumerations) and many incoming connections (builders and callers supplying many class loaders), matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
