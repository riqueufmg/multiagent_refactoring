    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.DefaultValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DefaultValue has a small, well-scoped set of outgoing dependencies: it references IntegerConstant, LongConstant, FloatConstant, DoubleConstant, NullConstant and StackManipulation.Trivial (via its enum constants) and uses TypeDefinition in its of(...) factory and standard ASM/Implementation types in its apply signature. Incoming usages in the provided excerpt are limited (e.g. StubMethod.apply calls DefaultValue.of(...); VoidAwareAssigner.assign calls DefaultValue.of(...)). The number of both incoming and outgoing relationships shown is small and purposeful (mapping types to their JVM default constants), so it does not act as a hub-like abstraction with many unrelated dependencies."
