    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.NumberTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NumberTypeAdapter has a small, focused set of incoming/outgoing dependencies rather than many. Outgoing dependencies observed in the class: ToNumberStrategy (field and usage), ToNumberPolicy (factory constant), TypeAdapter (superclass), TypeAdapterFactory (anonymous factory returned by newFactory), TypeToken (checked in factory), JsonReader/JsonToken (read logic), JsonWriter (write logic), JsonSyntaxException/IOException. Incoming usage is limited (registered once in Gson via factories.add(NumberTypeAdapter.getFactory(...))). The class implements a single responsibility (reading/writing Number via a provided strategy) and only interacts with these few related abstractions, so it does not act as a dependency hub connected to a large number of other modules."
