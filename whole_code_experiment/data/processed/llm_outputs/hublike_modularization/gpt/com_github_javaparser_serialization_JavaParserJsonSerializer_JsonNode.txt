    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The JsonNode enum has very few dependencies: it holds four enum constants and a propertyKey field, and only one non-trivial reference to JavaParserMetaModel.commentMetaModel via decapitalize(JavaParserMetaModel.commentMetaModel.getTypeName()). Its uses are internal to JavaParserJsonSerializer (e.g., generator.write(JsonNode.CLASS.propertyKey, ...)), so incoming/outgoing coupling is limited and localized. There is not a large number of incoming/outgoing dependencies to other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
