    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MinimalEncoder, while large and highly cohesive (many internal nested types: Edge, Result, Input) and complex, does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization because it has only a small number of external dependencies. The class references a few other abstractions (HighLevelEncoder, com.google.zxing.common.MinimalECIInput, SymbolShapeHint, java.nio.charset.Charset/StandardCharsets and standard collection types) and most relationships are internal (nested classes Edge/Result/Input). There is no evidence here of this class having incoming/outgoing dependencies with a large number of distinct external abstractions, so it is not acting as a dependency hub."
