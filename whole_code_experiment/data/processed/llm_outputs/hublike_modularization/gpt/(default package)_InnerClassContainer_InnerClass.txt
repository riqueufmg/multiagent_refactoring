    "class": "(default package).InnerClassContainer.InnerClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "InnerClassContainer.InnerClass does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It only contains nested inner types (InnerInnerClass and InnerInnerInnerClass) within the same top-level container and defines a small number of self-contained static methods (methodCall, innerMethodCall, innerInnerMethodCall). There are no many incoming or outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions — the relationships are purely hierarchical and limited in scope — so the hub-like smell is not present."
