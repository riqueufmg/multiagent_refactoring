    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.UncheckedFutureImpl",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "UncheckedFutureImpl has only a small number of dependencies: it extends AbstractFutureProxy, implements UncheckedFuture, and references a few standard types (Future, TimeUnit, ExecutionException, InterruptedException, TimeoutException) and a few unchecked wrapper exceptions (UncheckedInterruptedException, UncheckedExecutionException, UncheckedTimeoutException). There is no evidence in the provided code of many incoming or outgoing dependencies that would make it a hub; its role is narrowly focused on converting checked exceptions to unchecked ones."
