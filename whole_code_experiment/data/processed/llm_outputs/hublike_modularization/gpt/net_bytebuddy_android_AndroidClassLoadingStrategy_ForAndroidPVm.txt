    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.Injecting.Dispatcher.ForAndroidPVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The ForAndroidPVm class has a small, focused API surface (one constructor, two methods: loadDex and loadClass) and depends on a limited set of abstractions (java.lang.reflect.Method 'addDexPath', dalvik.system.DexFile, android BaseDexClassLoader, java.io.File, RandomString, IOException). It is instantiated/resolved only in the Injecting.Dispatcher static initializer and used by the Injecting class's doLoad flow. There is no evidence in this class of incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions or it acting as a central mediator for many modules, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
