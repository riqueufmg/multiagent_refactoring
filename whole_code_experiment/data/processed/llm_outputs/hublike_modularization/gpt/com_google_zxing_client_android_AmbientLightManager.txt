    "justification": "AmbientLightManager has a small, cohesive set of dependencies focused on ambient-light functionality: it depends on Context/PreferenceManager/SharedPreferences and FrontLightMode to read prefs, on Android SensorManager/Sensor APIs to receive light events, and on CameraManager to toggle the torch (cameraManager.setTorch). It is instantiated and used by CaptureActivity (single incoming reference in the provided code). Because it has only a handful of related outgoing dependencies and only one clear incoming dependency (CaptureActivity), it does not act as a hub with a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies and therefore does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
