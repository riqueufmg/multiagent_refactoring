    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodAccessorFactory.Illegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a tiny singleton enum (INSTANCE) implementing MethodAccessorFactory whose three methods simply throw IllegalStateException. It only touches a small set of closely related types (MethodAccessorFactory, Implementation.SpecialMethodInvocation, MethodDescription.InDefinedShape, FieldDescription, AccessType) and contains no aggregating collections or routing logic to many other abstractions. It therefore does not exhibit the many incoming/outgoing dependency relationships characteristic of a hub-like module."
