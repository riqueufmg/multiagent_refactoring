    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Injecting class acts as a central orchestrator and is tightly coupled to many distinct abstractions, indicating a hub-like modularization. Evidence of high outgoing coupling: it directly uses dalvik.system.DexFile, java.io.File, java.io.IOException, java.util.Map/HashMap/Set, java.util.RandomString (via RandomString), java.lang.ClassLoader, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and inherits/relies on DexProcessor and privateDirectory from AndroidClassLoadingStrategy. It also delegates to a complex Dispatcher abstraction with multiple implementations (Dispatcher.ForLegacyVm, Dispatcher.ForAndroidPVm) and resolves reflection targets (BaseDexClassLoader.addDexPath). Key code sites showing coordination with many modules: static DISPATCHER initialization (reflective binding to BaseDexClassLoader), doLoad(...) calling DISPATCHER.loadDex(...) and DISPATCHER.loadClass(...), synchronized usage of the target ClassLoader, construction via super(privateDirectory, dexProcessor), and exception handling (IOException, IllegalArgumentException). This wide set of incoming/outgoing relationships to platform classes, I/O, reflection-based dispatchers and several nested module implementations demonstrates that Injecting is a hub connecting many otherwise independent abstractions."
