    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ConstructorResolutionLogic exhibits hub-like modularization: it has outgoing dependencies on many abstractions across packages and is used by multiple other modules. Outgoing dependencies (types/methods it uses): ResolvedConstructorDeclaration, ResolvedType, ResolvedArrayType, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, TypeSolver, SymbolReference, MethodAmbiguityException (imports at top and parameter/return types and thrown exceptions); it directly calls several static methods on MethodResolutionLogic (replaceTypeParam, isAssignableMatchTypeParameters, isExactMatch, isMoreSpecific) and manipulates many Resolved* types. Incoming dependencies (callers): JavaParserFacade (uses ConstructorResolutionLogic.findMostApplicable in solve(ObjectCreationExpr) and solve(ExplicitConstructorInvocationStmt)), JavaParserTypeDeclarationAdapter (solveConstructor delegates to ConstructorResolutionLogic.findMostApplicable). The class therefore sits at the center of constructor resolution logic, bridging type-system abstractions, solver infrastructure, and higher-level facades — i.e., many incoming and outgoing edges, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
