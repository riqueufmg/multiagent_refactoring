    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation.Illegal",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The StackManipulation abstraction (of which Illegal is a canonical instance) is acting as a central hub: many other high-level components import and depend on it. For example, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation and its nested types reference StackManipulation (Usage appears throughout Implementation, Implementation.Context/Default, Compound, Simple/ForDispatcher/Appender, DelegationRecord, AccessorMethodDelegation, FieldGetterDelegation, FieldSetterDelegation, FieldCacheEntry, etc.). The Illegal enum itself implements StackManipulation and depends on MethodVisitor and Implementation.Context (apply method) and the broader StackManipulation API (Size, Trivial, Compound, Simple) provides types used widely by bytecode-producing classes such as ByteCodeAppender, FieldAccess, MethodInvocation, MethodReturn and MethodVariableAccess. This results in a single abstraction with a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies (many Implementation.* classes depend on it and it depends on ASM's MethodVisitor and Implementation.Context types), which matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
