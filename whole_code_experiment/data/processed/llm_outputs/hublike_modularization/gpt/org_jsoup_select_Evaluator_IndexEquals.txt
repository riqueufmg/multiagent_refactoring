    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.IndexEquals",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IndexEquals is a small, focused nested evaluator: it extends the inner abstract IndexEvaluator (and transitively Evaluator) and uses a single external abstraction org.jsoup.nodes.Element (calls element.elementSiblingIndex()). It has no references to many other classes or subsystems (no use of Regex, Pattern, Node types beyond Element, no collections or factory interactions). Although the file contains many other Evaluator inner classes, IndexEquals itself has only a few dependencies (IndexEvaluator, Evaluator, Element, primitive int), so it does not act as a hub with large numbers of incoming/outgoing abstraction links."
