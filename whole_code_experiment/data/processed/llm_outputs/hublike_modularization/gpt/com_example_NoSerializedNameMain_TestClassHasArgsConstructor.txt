    "class": "com.example.NoSerializedNameMain",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NoSerializedNameMain has a small, focused set of dependencies: outgoing references to com.google.gson.Gson and com.google.gson.GsonBuilder, a static import/use of com.example.TestExecutor.same, and its three nested test classes (TestClassNoArgsConstructor, TestClassNotAbstract, TestClassHasArgsConstructor). There are no many incoming/outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; the dependencies are limited and cohesive for JSON deserialization tests, so this is not a hub-like modularization."
