    "class": "org.jsoup.examples.ListLinks",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ListLinks has several outgoing dependencies (it calls org.jsoup.helper.Validate.isTrue, org.jsoup.Jsoup.connect(...).get(), and uses org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.select.Elements, org.jsoup.nodes.Element) but it is a small example/entrypoint class with no incoming dependencies from the analyzed codebase. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here ListLinks has only a few outgoing references and no other classes reference it in the provided dependency set, so it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
