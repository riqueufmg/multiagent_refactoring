    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask acts as a hub: it depends on many external abstractions (outgoing deps) and is referenced/used by other components (incoming deps). Outgoing dependencies include ByteBuddy, ClassFileVersion, EntryPoint, Plugin (Plugin.Engine.Source/Target/Factory), ClassFileLocator and many Gradle/Android types (ConfigurableFileCollection, Directory, RegularFileProperty, Logger, etc.), plus reflective resolution of Discovery and invocation of AbstractByteBuddyTask.apply. It also contains substantial nested collaborators (DefaultAndroidDescriptor using ClassFileLocator and filesystem traversal; TargetForAndroidAppJarFile writing JARs) that further couple it to ClassFileLocator, JarOutputStream, Manifest and I/O abstractions. Incoming dependencies: ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin/TransformationDispatcher register and instantiate this task (ConfigurationAction) and wire it into the Gradle/Android pipeline. The class therefore has many incoming and outgoing links across distinct modules (Byte Buddy core, build plugin, Gradle API, Android API, I/O), matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
