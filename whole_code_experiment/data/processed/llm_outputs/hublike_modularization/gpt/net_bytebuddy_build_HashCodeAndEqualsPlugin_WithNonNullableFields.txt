    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin.WithNonNullableFields",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "WithNonNullableFields is a small nested subclass of HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin with limited interactions: it declares two trivial constructors that call super and overrides a single protected method nonNullable(ElementMatcher<FieldDescription>) returning not(matcher). Its direct dependencies are minimal (extends HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin; references ElementMatcher<FieldDescription>, FieldDescription, and ElementMatchers.not). There are no signs of it having a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies to many other abstractions in the provided code, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
