    "justification": "This abstraction acts as a central hub: the TypePool interface (and its nested implementations) both depends on and is depended on by a large number of other abstractions. Evidence of many outgoing dependencies: references to TypeDescription, AnnotationDescription, FieldDescription, MethodDescription, RecordComponentDescription, Generic/TypeList/TypeVariableSource, ClassFileLocator, AsmClassReader.Factory, ClassReader/SignatureVisitor, ASM visitors (ClassVisitor/MethodVisitor/FieldVisitor/ModuleVisitor), ModuleDescription, PackageDescription, DynamicType, ClassLoadingStrategy and numerous java.util and java.util.concurrent types. Evidence of many incoming dependencies: multiple nested classes and helpers call back into the type pool (e.g. LazyTypeDescription, TokenizedGenericType, LazyAnnotationDescription, ComponentTypeLocator.ForAnnotationProperty, TokenizedGenericType.toErasure) using typePool.describe(...).resolve(), and CacheProvider wrappers (WithIllegalResolutionReattempt, Discriminating) coordinate caching around it. The sheer number of distinct responsibilities (parsing, lazy resolution, generic/signature extraction, annotation handling, module/package handling, caching and class loading) and the many classes that both call into and are orchestrated by this abstraction indicate hub-like modularization."
