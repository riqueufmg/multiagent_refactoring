    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableLongUnaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The interface has very few dependencies: it imports java.util.Objects and java.util.function.LongUnaryOperator, and refers to itself (FailableLongUnaryOperator) in methods and constants (NOP, identity, nop, compose, andThen, applyAsLong). There are no incoming/outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (only a Javadoc mention of FailableDoubleUnaryOperator). Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
