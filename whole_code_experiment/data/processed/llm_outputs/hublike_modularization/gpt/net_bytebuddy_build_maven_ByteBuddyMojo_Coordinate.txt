    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Coordinate is used widely within ByteBuddyMojo (e.g. Map<Coordinate,String> coordinates in execute(), transform(), apply() and in ForExplicitLocations.resolveClassPathElements(), places where new Coordinate(...) is created to index dependency versions), showing many incoming references. However, the Coordinate class itself has minimal outgoing dependencies: it only stores two Strings (groupId, artifactId) and implements hashCode() and equals(). It does not depend on many other abstractions or reference many external types. Because hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies, Coordinate is not a hub: many incoming usages but very few outgoing dependencies."
