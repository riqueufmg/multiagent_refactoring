    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SingleMemberAnnotationExprMetaModel has only a small, explicit set of dependencies: it extends AnnotationExprMetaModel, its constructor accepts Optional<BaseNodeMetaModel>, it refers to the runtime node type SingleMemberAnnotationExpr.class, and it declares a single PropertyMetaModel field (memberValuePropertyMetaModel). There are no many outgoing references to a large number of different abstractions from within this class. Although JavaParserMetaModel registers many node meta-model instances (including this one), that registration alone does not make SingleMemberAnnotationExprMetaModel a hub: it is one meta-model among many and does not itself depend on or aggregate a very large set of other abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
