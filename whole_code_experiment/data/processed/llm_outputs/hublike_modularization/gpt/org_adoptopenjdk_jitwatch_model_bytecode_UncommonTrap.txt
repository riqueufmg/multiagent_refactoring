    "justification": "UncommonTrap has only a small number of dependencies: outgoing dependencies are limited to Tag (parse(Tag)), a few JITWatchConstants attributes (static imports), and standard Java types (Map, String, Integer). Incoming usage in the provided code is limited (BytecodeAnnotationBuilder.visitTagUncommonTrap calls UncommonTrap.parse and uses the instance for a LineAnnotation). There is no evidence in the analyzed files of a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships that would make this a hub; therefore it is not exhibiting Hub-like Modularization."
