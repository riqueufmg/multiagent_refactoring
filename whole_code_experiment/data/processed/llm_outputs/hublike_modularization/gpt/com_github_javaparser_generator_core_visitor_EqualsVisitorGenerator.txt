    "detection": false,
    "justification": "EqualsVisitorGenerator has a focused set of dependencies rather than being a hub. Its imports and usages are limited to a small, coherent group: VisitorGenerator (superclass), SourceRoot (constructor parameter), com.github.javaparser.ast types used for generation (CompilationUnit, MethodDeclaration, BlockStmt), and metamodel types (BaseNodeMetaModel, PropertyMetaModel). The generateVisitMethodBody method mainly iterates over node.getAllPropertyMetaModels() and emits statements based on PropertyMetaModel, which is expected for a generator and does not indicate widespread incoming/outgoing dependencies across the system. There is no evidence in the provided code of a large number of different abstractions depending on this class or this class depending on many unrelated modules, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
