    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableDoubleToLongFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The interface has very few dependencies: it imports java.util.function.DoubleToLongFunction (only for javadoc reference) and uses Throwable in its generic bound. It declares a single functional method applyAsLong, one static NOP field and a nop() factory method. There are no references to a large number of other abstractions (no many incoming/outgoing dependencies), so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
