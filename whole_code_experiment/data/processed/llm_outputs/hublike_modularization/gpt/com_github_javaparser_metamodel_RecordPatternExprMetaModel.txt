    "detection": false,
    "justification": "RecordPatternExprMetaModel has only a few direct dependencies: it extends PatternExprMetaModel, references RecordPatternExpr.class in its constructor, and declares two PropertyMetaModel fields (modifiersPropertyMetaModel, patternListPropertyMetaModel). It imports only a small set of types (Generated, RecordPatternExpr, Optional) and contains no large collection of incoming/outgoing links itself. The wider metamodel (JavaParserMetaModel) references this meta-model instance, but that is a normal registration; the class itself is not coupled to a large number of different abstractions and therefore does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
