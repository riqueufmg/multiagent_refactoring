    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ErrorCorrection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ErrorCorrection has a small, focused set of dependencies: it constructs and uses ModulusGF and ModulusPoly heavily (outgoing) and throws/returns ChecksumException. Its only evident client in the provided code is PDF417ScanningDecoder (incoming). The number of distinct incoming and outgoing abstraction relationships is small and the class's responsibilities are cohesive (Reed–Solomon/PDF417 error correction), so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
