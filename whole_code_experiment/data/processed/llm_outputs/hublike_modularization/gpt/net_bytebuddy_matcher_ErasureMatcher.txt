    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ErasureMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ErasureMatcher has only a few direct dependencies: ElementMatcher (field and superclass types), TypeDefinition/TypeDescription (generic bound and asErasure usage) and the HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin.Enhance annotation. Its implementation is small and focused (constructor, doMatch delegating to matcher.matches(target.asErasure()), and toString). There is no evidence of incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
