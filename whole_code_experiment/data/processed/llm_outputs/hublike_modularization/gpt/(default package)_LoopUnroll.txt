    "class": "(default package).LoopUnroll",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LoopUnroll is not a hub: it has very few external dependencies (uses java.util.Random to populate data and System.out.println for output, plus core java.lang types such as String) and most interactions are internal private helper methods operating on the internal long[] data. There are many private methods, but those are internal to the same abstraction rather than dependencies to many other abstractions, and there are no numerous incoming references from other classes. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
