    "justification": "ITFWriter does not act as a hub: it has a small, limited set of dependencies (extends OneDimensionalCodeWriter; uses com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat; imports com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix; uses java.util.Collection and java.util.Collections; uses java.lang.Character). Its logic is self-contained (internal PATTERNS, START_PATTERN, END_PATTERN) and there is no evidence in the provided data of a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships with many other abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
