    "detection": true,
    "justification": "HttpConnection acts as a central hub with many incoming and outgoing dependencies across modules. Examples of outgoing dependencies from this class (and its inner types) include: DataUtil (charset detection, readToByteBuffer, mimeBoundary, crossStreams, parseInputStream), ControllableInputStream (wrap, timeout, onProgress, readToByteBuffer), RequestExecutor/RequestDispatch (RequestExecutor.execute(), responseBody(), RequestDispatch.get(...) used in Response.execute), CookieUtil.storeCookies(...) (in Response.prepareResponse), UrlBuilder (Request.url(URL) and serialiseRequestUrl), Parser/StreamParser/Document (parse(), streamParser(), switching parser for XML), AuthenticationHandler/RequestAuthenticator (auth handling and AuthenticationHandler.handler.remove()), CookieManager/CookieStore, SSLSocketFactory and SSLContext, and many JDK I/O and networking types (InputStream, OutputStream, GZIPInputStream, InflaterInputStream, Proxy, URL, URLEncoder, InetSocketAddress). Incoming dependencies are also evident: RequestExecutor statically imports HttpConnection.Request and HttpConnection.Response and other helper classes (AuthenticationHandler, ControllableInputStream, DataUtil, etc.) interact with HttpConnection internals. The class contains large nested types (Request, Response, KeyVal) that aggregate behavior and directly reference many modules (networking, parsing, auth, cookie management, progress reporting, buffer utilities). This concentration of responsibilities and many cross-module references (both uses of numerous external helpers and being referenced by executor/dispatch code) indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
