    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation.OfGenericMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "OfGenericMethod has only a small number of direct dependencies and primarily delegates to an inner invocation instance. Its fields reference TypeDescription (targetType) and WithImplicitInvocationTargetType (invocation). Its methods wrap/delegate calls to invocation (virtual, special, dynamic, onHandle, isValid, apply) and combine results with TypeCasting.to(...) and StackManipulation. It also touches JavaConstant, MethodVisitor and Implementation.Context in apply/dynamic paths. There is no evidence in the analyzed code of incoming/outgoing dependencies to a large set of other abstractions that would make it a hub; the class acts as a thin adapter/decorator rather than a central hub."
