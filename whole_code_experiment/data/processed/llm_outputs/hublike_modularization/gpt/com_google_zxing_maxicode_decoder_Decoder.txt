    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Decoder class has a limited, focused set of collaborators and acts as a coordinator for the MaxiCode decoding pipeline rather than a broad hub. Outgoing dependencies include BitMatrixParser, DecodedBitStreamParser, ReedSolomonDecoder (and GenericGF), BitMatrix, DecoderResult, and exceptions/utility types (ChecksumException, FormatException, ReedSolomonException, DecodeHintType, Map). Incoming usage in the provided code is minimal (MaxiCodeReader instantiates/uses Decoder). While Decoder interacts with several classes necessary for decoding (parsing, error correction, bitstream interpretation), it does not exhibit a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies spanning many unrelated modules. Its responsibilities (reading codewords, correcting errors, delegating to DecodedBitStreamParser) are cohesive, so this is not a Hub-like Modularization smell."
