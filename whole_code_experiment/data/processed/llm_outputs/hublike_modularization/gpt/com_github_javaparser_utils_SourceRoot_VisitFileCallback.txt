    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the abstraction is a tiny, local callback interface with a single method and only a few type dependencies (java.nio.file.Path, java.nio.file.attribute.BasicFileAttributes, java.nio.file.FileVisitResult). Its incoming references are limited to the enclosing ParallelParse class (constructor, compute() -> Files.walkFileTree visitFile) and the few lambda call-sites in SourceRoot.tryToParseParallelized / parseParallelized. It does not have many incoming or outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
