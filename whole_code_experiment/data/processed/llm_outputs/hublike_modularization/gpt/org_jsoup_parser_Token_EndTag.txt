    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Token class acts as a central hub: it directly depends on (outgoing) and is relied on by (incoming) many other abstractions. Evidence of many outgoing dependencies: uses org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes, org.jsoup.nodes.Range and its nested types (Range.Position, Range.AttributeRange), org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable, ParseSettings, TokeniserState, Tokeniser, CharacterReader, TokenData, and TreeBuilder (the Tag inner class stores a TreeBuilder reference and uses its reader and settings). Evidence of hub behavior in responsibilities: Token contains multiple nested token types (Doctype, Tag, StartTag, EndTag, Comment, Character, CData, XmlDecl, EOF) implementing different parsing behaviors, plus logic for attribute collection/tracking (attributes, attrName/attrValue, MaxAttributes, trackAttributeRange) that ties to Attributes and Range. It also bridges tokenisation and tree building (the TokenType field is used in switches in TreeBuilder and Tag.normalName() is used in tree building). The combination of many external class references, cross-cutting responsibilities (token representation, attribute management, source-range tracking) and its central role in parser/treebuilder/tokeniser interactions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
