    "justification": "ParserConfiguration acts as a central hub with many incoming and outgoing dependencies: it defines an extensive LanguageLevel enum that directly instantiates many Validator and PostProcessors implementations (Java1_0Validator..Java25Validator, Java10PostProcessor, Java11PostProcessor, etc.), it holds and constructs Processor implementations (UnicodeEscapeProcessor, LineEndingProcessor and multiple anonymous Processors) that reference UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider, LineEndingProcessingProvider, ParseResult, CommentsInserter, LexicalPreservingPrinter/DefaultLexicalPreservingPrinter and Node data keys; it exposes and is consumed by core parser classes (JavaParser, JavaParserAdapter, StaticJavaParser), project/collection utilities (SourceRoot, SourceZip, ProjectRoot, ParserCollectionStrategy, SymbolSolverCollectionStrategy), and type solving components (JavaParserTypeSolver, JavaSymbolSolver via SymbolResolver). It also provides widely-used configuration getters/setters (getCharacterEncoding, getLanguageLevel, getProcessors, getSymbolResolver) used across the codebase. The large number and variety of direct references both from this class to many validator/postprocessor/provider classes and from many other modules to ParserConfiguration indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
