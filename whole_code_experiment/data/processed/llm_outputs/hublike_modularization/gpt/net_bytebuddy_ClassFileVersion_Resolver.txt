    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ClassFileVersion has many outgoing dependencies across multiple subsystems and acts as a central utility API: imports and usages include net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator (and ClassFileLocator.ForClassLoader), net.bytebuddy.utility.nullability.MaybeNull, org.objectweb.asm.Opcodes, java.lang.reflect.Method, java.security.PrivilegedAction, java.lang.Runtime and System properties, java.io.IOException and Serializable. It exposes a large public surface (numerous public static constants JAVA_V1..JAVA_V26, of(), ofClassFile(), ofThisVm(), latest(), etc.) and contains an embedded VersionLocator that itself interacts with Runtime, reflection and System properties. The class both depends on many distinct abstractions and is clearly intended to be widely used by other components (central constants and factory methods), matching the characteristics of a hub with many incoming and outgoing relationships."
