    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CompilationUnitMetaModel has only a small, well-defined set of outgoing dependencies: it extends NodeMetaModel and references CompilationUnit.class in its constructor, and declares four PropertyMetaModel fields (importsPropertyMetaModel, modulePropertyMetaModel, packageDeclarationPropertyMetaModel, typesPropertyMetaModel). There are no indications in this class of incoming/outgoing links to a large number of other abstractions. While JavaParserMetaModel acts as a central registry of many meta-models, CompilationUnitMetaModel itself is small and limited in scope and does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
