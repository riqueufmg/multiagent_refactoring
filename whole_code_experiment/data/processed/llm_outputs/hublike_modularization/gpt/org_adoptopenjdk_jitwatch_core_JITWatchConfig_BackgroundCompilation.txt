    "detection": true,
    "justification": "JITWatchConfig acts as a central hub: it directly depends on many other abstractions (Properties, File/FileReader/FileWriter, ParsedClasspath, StringUtil, JITWatchConstants, com.chrisnewland.freelogj.Logger/LoggerFactory) and exposes a large API (many getters/setters, marshal/unmarshal, save/load, profile management, VM language mapping). Examples of outgoing dependencies: loadPropertiesFromFile() and savePropertiesToFile() use File I/O and Properties; getAllClassLocations() calls parsedClasspath.getClassLocations(); addOrUpdateVMLanguage(), getVMLanguagePath(), and getVMLanguageList() manipulate loadedProps keys for VM languages. Examples implying many incoming dependencies: numerous public getters (getTieredCompilationMode, getBackgroundCompilationMode, getSourceLocations, getConfiguredClassLocations, getParsedClasspath, many boolean/int/string accessors) and setters that other modules will call. The class mixes responsibilities (file I/O, property parsing, profile logic, sandbox/VM settings, and providing configuration to callers), and therefore has both many outgoing collaborations and is likely depended-on by many clients — characteristics of a hub-like modularization smell."
