    "justification": "GmtTimeZone shows only a small number of dependencies: it extends java.util.TimeZone (superclass), references TimeZones.GMT_ID in its constructor, and uses standard library types (java.util.Date, java.util.Objects). There are no many incoming or outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions in the provided relationship data. The interaction surface is limited to the superclass and a single project helper (TimeZones), so it does not act as a hub."
