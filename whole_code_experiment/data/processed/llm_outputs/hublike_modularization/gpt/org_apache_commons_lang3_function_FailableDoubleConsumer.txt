    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableDoubleConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FailableDoubleConsumer has only a small number of outgoing dependencies (java.util.Objects, java.util.function.DoubleConsumer, and the Throwable type parameter). Its implementation is minimal (one abstract accept method, a NOP constant, and a simple andThen default method using Objects.requireNonNull). Incoming usage is limited (for example Failable.accept(FailableDoubleConsumer, double) references it). There is no evidence this abstraction has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
