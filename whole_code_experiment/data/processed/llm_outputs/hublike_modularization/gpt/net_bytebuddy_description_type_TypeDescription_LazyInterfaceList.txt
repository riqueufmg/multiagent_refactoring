    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected hub-like modularization: the LazyInterfaceList (nested under TypeDescription.Generic.LazyProjection.WithLazyNavigation) is tightly coupled to many other abstractions and acts as a central connector. Outgoing dependencies include: TypeDescription.Generic (element type returned), TypeDescription.Generic.LazyProjection (delegate), TypeList.Generic (rawInterfaces), TypeDescription (asErasure()/asGenericType()), AnnotationReader (in lazy projections), and nested LazyInterfaceType which itself depends on LazyProjection and Generic. Incoming dependencies / callers: TypeDescription.Generic.WithLazyNavigation.getInterfaces() returns LazyInterfaceList.of(this), TypeDescription and TypeList implementations (e.g. ForLoadedTypes, ForDetachedTypes, ForLoadedInterfaceTypes) interact with these lazy interface lists. The class is referenced across many responsibilities in the type-model (fields, methods, annotations, generic projections) and appears in multiple lists and projections in the provided files. This concentration of both many incoming uses and many outgoing references to different abstractions (TypeList, Generic, LazyProjection, AnnotationReader, TypeDescription, nested projection types) indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
