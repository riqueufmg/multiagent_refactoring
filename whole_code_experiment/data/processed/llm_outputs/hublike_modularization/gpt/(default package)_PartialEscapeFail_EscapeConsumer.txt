    "class": "(default package).PartialEscapeFail.EscapeConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "EscapeConsumer has very few dependencies: it only accepts java.lang.Integer and performs primitive/local computations. It does not depend on or reference a large number of other abstractions, nor is it referenced by many unrelated classes (only used by its enclosing PartialEscapeFail). Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (no large incoming/outgoing dependency set)."
