    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Decoder class has many outgoing dependencies across multiple packages and is referenced by other top-level components, making it a hub. Evidence of outgoing dependencies: it constructs/uses ReedSolomonDecoder and GenericGF (rsDecoder = new ReedSolomonDecoder(GenericGF.QR_CODE_FIELD_256)), manipulates BitMatrix and BitMatrix.parse(boolean[][]), interacts with BitMatrixParser (decode(BitMatrix) -> new BitMatrixParser(bits) and decode(BitMatrixParser,...)), calls DataBlock.getDataBlocks(...), uses Version and ErrorCorrectionLevel, calls rsDecoder.decodeWithECCount(...) and handles ReedSolomonException, invokes DecodedBitStreamParser.decode(...), and creates QRCodeDecoderMetaData on mirrored success. It also depends on types from com.google.zxing (ChecksumException, FormatException, DecodeHintType, DecoderResult) and java.util.Map. Evidence of incoming dependency: QRCodeReader instantiates and delegates to Decoder (private final Decoder decoder = new Decoder(); decoder.decode(...)). Because Decoder both depends on a large number of other abstractions (BitMatrix, BitMatrixParser, DataBlock, Version, ErrorCorrectionLevel, ReedSolomonDecoder/GenericGF/GenericGFPoly related classes, DecodedBitStreamParser, QRCodeDecoderMetaData, exceptions and hint types) and is used by higher-level readers (e.g., QRCodeReader), it functions as a central hub and exhibits Hub-like Modularization."
