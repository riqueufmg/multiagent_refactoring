    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The ForJarOutputStream nested class has a narrow responsibility (writing entries to a JarOutputStream). Its outgoing dependencies are few and focused: JarOutputStream, JarEntry, Source.Element, InputStream/OutputStream and IOException handling (see methods store(...), retain(...), close()). It does not reference a large number of unrelated abstractions nor does the code show many different callers or incoming dependency points in the provided snippet. Therefore it does not act as a hub with many incoming and outgoing dependencies."
