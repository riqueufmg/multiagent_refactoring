    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Version",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Version class does not act as a hub coupling many different abstractions. Its only external dependency is com.google.zxing.FormatException; the other related types (ECBlocks, ECB) are static nested classes defined inside Version (internal to the abstraction). The large VERSIONS array contains many Version instances (data), but those are instances of the same class, not distinct external abstractions. Methods (e.g., getVersionForDimensions) iterate the internal VERSIONS array and do not introduce many incoming/outgoing dependencies to other classes or modules. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
