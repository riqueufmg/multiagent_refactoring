    "justification": "The UsingInstrumentation class is acting as a hub: it has many outgoing dependencies (Instrumentation - field and parameters; JavaDispatcher - private static final Dispatcher DISPATCHER = doPrivileged(JavaDispatcher.of(Dispatcher.class)); RandomString - field randomString and usage randomString.nextString(); IO and archive types - File, FileOutputStream, JarOutputStream, JarFile, ZipFile; Class resolution and loading - Class.forName(..., target.getClassLoader()); ClassFileLocator - classFileLocator.locate(name).resolve(); JavaModule and module-redefinition support via redefineModule(...) which converts and passes sets/maps to DISPATCHER.redefineModule). It also exposes services used by other components (incoming dependencies): UsingUnsafe.Factory.resolve directly calls ClassInjector.UsingInstrumentation.redefineModule(instrumentation, ...), showing other injector factories depend on it. Additionally, the Target enum uses the dispatcher (DISPATCHER.appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch / appendToSystemClassLoaderSearch) to perform core behavior. The combination of numerous distinct external APIs and being referenced/called by other injector factories indicates hub-like modularization (many incoming and outgoing dependency relationships)."
