    "justification": "Class A implements DuplicateTypeName and declares an inner class DuplicateTypeName that extends A, creating a circular dependency between A and DuplicateTypeName. However, Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here the coupling is only between two types (A and its single nested DuplicateTypeName), so it does not qualify as a hub."
