    "detection": true,
    "justification": "HeadlessInlineVisitor acts as a coordination hub with many incoming and outgoing dependencies across multiple packages. Evidence: (1) It depends on numerous model and compilation abstractions: IReadOnlyJITDataModel, IMetaMember, Compilation, IParseDictionary, Tag, ParseUtil and CompilationUtil (visit() calls metaMember.getCompilations() and CompilationUtil.visitParseTagsOfCompilation). (2) Its nested InlineJournalVisitor implements/uses AbstractCompilationVisitable and ICompilationVisitable and traverses parse/tag structures, calling ParseUtil.lookupMember and parseDictionary.getMethod to build InlineFailureInfo — showing outgoing dependencies to parsing utilities and model tag lookup. (3) It aggregates data in a central failures Map<String, Map<String, InlineFailureInfo>> used across visitors, making it the central collector of inline-failure information. (4) It is used by higher-level launching/visiting code (LaunchHeadless creates and drives it via TreeVisitor.walkTree), showing incoming dependencies from UI/launcher code. (5) It touches logging (Logger/LoggerFactory) and other utility classes. Together these many cross-cutting references (model, compilation, parse dictionary, utilities, visitor infrastructure and launcher) indicate a hub-like modularization: a single abstraction with many incoming and outgoing relationships."
