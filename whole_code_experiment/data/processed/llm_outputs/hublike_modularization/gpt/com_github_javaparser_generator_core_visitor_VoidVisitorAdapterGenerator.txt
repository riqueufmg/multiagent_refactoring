    "justification": "VoidVisitorAdapterGenerator has a small, focused set of dependencies related to its single responsibility (generating the VoidVisitorAdapter): it extends VisitorGenerator and uses SourceRoot, CodeGenerationUtils.f, BaseNodeMetaModel, PropertyMetaModel, CompilationUnit, MethodDeclaration and BlockStmt. These are cohesive (metamodel + AST + codegen utilities) and do not indicate large numbers of incoming/outgoing relationships across unrelated modules. There is no evidence in the provided code of it acting as a central hub with many disparate dependencies or many dependents, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
