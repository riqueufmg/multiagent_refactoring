    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.StringLiteral",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StringLiteral is a small private static inner class with a single field (String value), a constructor, and two methods: appendTo(Appendable, Calendar) which only calls buffer.append(value), and estimateLength() which returns value.length(). It implements the local Rule interface and only references java.lang.String, java.lang.Appendable and java.util.Calendar in its method signature. It is created locally as a literal holder (e.g. in parsePattern) and does not have incoming/outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
