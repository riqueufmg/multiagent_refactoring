    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The OfConstant class is a small nested binder that exposes only two fields (type, value) and two trivial methods (getHandledType and bind). Its direct dependencies are limited to a handful of types required by the ParameterBinder API (AnnotationDescription.Loadable, MethodDescription, ParameterDescription, Class, Object and the MaybeNull annotation) and it mainly returns a stored constant value. It does not maintain or coordinate relationships with a large number of other abstractions (no large maps/lists of collaborators, no many incoming/outgoing edges), so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
