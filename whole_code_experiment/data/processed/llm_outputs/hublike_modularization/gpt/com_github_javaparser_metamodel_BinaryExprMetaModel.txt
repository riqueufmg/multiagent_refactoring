    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BinaryExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BinaryExprMetaModel has only a small set of direct dependencies: it extends ExpressionMetaModel, its constructor references BinaryExpr.class and Optional<BaseNodeMetaModel>, and it declares three PropertyMetaModel fields (leftPropertyMetaModel, operatorPropertyMetaModel, rightPropertyMetaModel). The main incoming reference is the JavaParserMetaModel which instantiates binaryExprMetaModel and assigns those property meta models. There is no evidence in the analyzed code that BinaryExprMetaModel has incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
