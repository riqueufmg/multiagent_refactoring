    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: JavadocWriter has a small, focused set of collaborators rather than a large number of incoming/outgoing dependencies. Incoming usage is primarily from JavadocFormatter.render which constructs and drives the writer. Outgoing dependencies are limited and cohesive: Token and Token.Type (for token values and behavior), NestingCounter (for nesting bookkeeping), JavadocFormatter.MAX_LINE_LENGTH (for line-wrapping), and a small immutable START_OF_LINE_TOKENS set (Guava ImmutableSet). Most other behavior is internal (request/write methods, nested enums AutoIndent and RequestedWhitespace). The class acts as the natural single responsibility for producing formatted Javadoc rather than an overconnected hub."
