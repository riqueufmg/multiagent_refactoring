    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BookmarkPickerActivity has a small, focused set of dependencies: Android framework types (ListActivity, Intent, Cursor, Uri, Log, View, ListView), the content provider BOOKMARKS_URI and projection, a local BookmarkAdapter, and the Intents constants (Intents.FLAG_NEW_DOC). It neither depends on a large number of different project abstractions nor is there evidence it has many incoming dependencies from many modules. The interactions are limited and cohesive (querying bookmarks, populating a list, returning a selected bookmark), so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
