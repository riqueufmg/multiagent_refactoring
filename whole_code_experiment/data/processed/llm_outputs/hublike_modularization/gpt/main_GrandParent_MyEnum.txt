    "justification": "The enum MyEnum only declares two constants (A(\"a\"), B(\"b\")) and a string literal; there are no outgoing dependencies (no references, method calls, fields or types used from other abstractions) and no incoming dependencies present in the analyzed code. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
