    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.CompositeFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a focused responsibility: it aggregates Comparator<File> delegates and delegates compare calls to them. Its explicit dependencies are limited to a small set of standard types (java.io.File, java.io.Serializable, java.util.Comparator, stream/array utilities) and it extends a single AbstractFileComparator. Although it holds an array of delegate comparators, the code does not show a large number of distinct incoming/outgoing module dependencies (no evidence of many different abstractions depending on it or it depending on many distinct modules). Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
