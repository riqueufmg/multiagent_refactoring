    "justification": "The class only declares 'public class Java22PostProcessor extends Java21PostProcessor {}' and contains no fields, methods, or additional imports. It has a single outgoing dependency (its superclass Java21PostProcessor) and there is no evidence in this file of many incoming dependencies. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
