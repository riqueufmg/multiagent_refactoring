    "justification": "LegacyByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask acts as a central coordinator that depends on many different abstractions and is also referenced by other components. Outgoing dependencies (the task depends on many abstractions): execute() constructs and composes ClassFileLocator instances (ClassFileLocator, ClassFileLocator.Compound, ForJarFile/ForFolder/ForClassLoader/ForUrl), uses ByteBuddy and ClassFileVersion, creates URLClassLoader/ClassLoader, uses Plugin/Plugin.Engine/Plugin.Factory/Plugin.Engine.Default (scan, of, apply), EntryPoint (EntryPoint.Unvalidated / EntryPoint.Default.DECORATE), MethodNameTransformer (Suffixing.withRandomSuffix), BuildLogger (and reflective resolution of net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.GradleBuildLogger), AndroidDescriptor.Trivial.LOCAL, Gradle APIs (ConfigurableFileCollection, Property<JavaVersion>, ListProperty<Directory>, DirectoryProperty) and many java/net classes (URL, URLClassLoader, File, IOException). Incoming dependencies (many components reference or wire this class): ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin (TransformationDispatcher.ForLegacyAndroid) registers and wires LegacyByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask.ConfigurationAction and TaskProvider for variant transforms, and other Gradle wiring calls into its configuration action. The class therefore has both numerous outgoing links to diverse subsystems (byte-buddy core, dynamic class file locators, plugin engine, logging, class loading, Gradle model types) and incoming links from the Android plugin integration code, making it a hub-like module coordinating many abstractions and responsibilities."
