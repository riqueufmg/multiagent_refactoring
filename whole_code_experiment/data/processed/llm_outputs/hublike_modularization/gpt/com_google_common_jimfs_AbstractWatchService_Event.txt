    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.AbstractWatchService.Event",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Event class is a small, self-contained immutable data holder with only a few dependencies: it implements WatchEvent<T> and uses WatchEvent.Kind<T>, Guava Preconditions (checkNotNull, checkArgument), java.util.Objects, and MoreObjects for toString. Incoming coupling is minimal (Key.overflowEvent creates Event instances), and there are no links to a large number of other abstractions or modules. It does not act as a central hub—its responsibilities and dependencies are narrow and local—so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
