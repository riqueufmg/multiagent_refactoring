    "detection": true,
    "justification": "JavassistEnumDeclaration acts as a hub: it directly depends on many other abstractions (outgoing deps) and is constructed/consumed by other central factories/utilities (incoming deps). Outgoing dependencies visible in the class: TypeSolver (field and many method calls), JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter (field; many methods delegate to it: getAncestors, getDeclaredFields/getAllFields, getConstructors, getTypeParameters, containerType, internalTypes, getInternalType, isAssignableBy, isAssignableBy(ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration)), JavassistUtils (solveMethod, solveMethodAsUsage calls), JavassistFactory (accessSpecifier via modifiersToAccessLevel and factory-created elsewhere), SymbolSolver (solveSymbolForFQN usage), JavassistEnumConstantDeclaration (getEnumConstants mapping), JavassistFieldDeclaration (solveSymbol returns new JavassistFieldDeclaration), javassist.CtClass/CtField and AccessFlag. Incoming dependencies (examples): JavassistFactory creates new JavassistEnumDeclaration (typeUsageFor, toTypeDeclaration), utilities like JavassistUtils and other symbol-resolution components accept/operate on ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration (which this class implements) making it a central target for many resolution flows, and JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter is instantiated with this as the typeDeclaration. The class implements multiple resolution capability interfaces (MethodResolutionCapability, MethodUsageResolutionCapability, SymbolResolutionCapability) and extends AbstractTypeDeclaration, increasing the number of interactions. The combination of many distinct collaborators, bidirectional links with adapter/factory/util classes, and multiple roles in the resolution system indicate a hub-like modularization smell."
