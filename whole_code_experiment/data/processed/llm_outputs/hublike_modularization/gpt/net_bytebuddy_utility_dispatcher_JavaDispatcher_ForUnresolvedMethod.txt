    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.ForUnresolvedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The ForUnresolvedMethod nested class is small and self-contained: it holds a single String field (message), its invoke(Object[]) method only throws an IllegalStateException, and its apply(MethodVisitor, Method) method emits bytecode to construct and throw an IllegalStateException. Its references are limited (IllegalStateException, MethodVisitor, Method, ASM Opcodes/Type, MethodDescription.CONSTRUCTOR_INTERNAL_NAME). It does not maintain or coordinate dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
