    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.WithFixedSuffix",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class is a small factory wrapper that only holds a single field (private final String suffix), a constructor, and two make(...) methods that delegate to new Default(..., suffix). Its outgoing dependencies are limited to a few types required for delegation: TypeDescription, AuxiliaryType.NamingStrategy, TypeInitializer, ClassFileVersion, and Implementation.Context.FrameGeneration (and the enclosing Default implementation). It does not itself reference or coordinate a large number of other abstractions nor aggregate many distinct responsibilities. There is no evidence of many incoming/outgoing links (no large collections of collaborators or complex routing logic). Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
