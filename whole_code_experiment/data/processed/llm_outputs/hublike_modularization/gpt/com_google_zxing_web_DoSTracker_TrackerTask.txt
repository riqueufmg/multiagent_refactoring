    "justification": [
        "DoSTracker uses a modest set of external types (Timer/TimerTask, Map, AtomicInteger, Logger, ManagementFactory/OperatingSystemMXBean, and an LRUMap implementation), which are typical for its functionality and do not indicate an excessive number of outgoing dependencies.",
        "The class has a single, cohesive responsibility (tracking recent accesses and adjusting thresholds), and its internal interactions (including the inner TrackerTask) support that responsibility rather than creating broad coupling to many unrelated abstractions.",
        "There is no evidence in the provided code of many incoming dependencies (i.e., many other modules/classes depending on DoSTracker) or of DoSTracker acting as a central hub mediating numerous unrelated components.",
        "Most dependencies are standard JDK or clearly related helper types; the quantity and nature of dependencies do not meet the definition of a hub-like modularization smell."
