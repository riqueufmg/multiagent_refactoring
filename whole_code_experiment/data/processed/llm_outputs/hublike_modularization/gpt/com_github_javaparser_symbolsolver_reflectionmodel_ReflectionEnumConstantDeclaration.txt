    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ReflectionEnumConstantDeclaration has a small, well-scoped set of dependencies: it implements ResolvedEnumConstantDeclaration and uses java.lang.reflect.Field and TypeSolver as fields; its getType() method constructs a ReflectionEnumDeclaration and a ReferenceTypeImpl (ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ResolvedType). Outgoing dependencies are limited to Field, TypeSolver, ReflectionEnumDeclaration, ReferenceTypeImpl and related resolution interfaces. Incoming usage in the provided code is minimal (e.g., ReflectionEnumDeclaration.getEnumConstants() instantiates it). It does not exhibit many incoming and outgoing connections to a large number of other abstractions, so it is not a hub-like module."
