    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The Entry class has a focused, small set of dependencies: it implements ElementMatcher<FieldDescription.InDefinedShape> and FieldVisitorWrapper and holds an ElementMatcher<? super FieldDescription.InDefinedShape> and a List<? extends FieldVisitorWrapper>. Its interactions are limited to FieldDescription.InDefinedShape, FieldVisitor, TypeDescription (for wrapping), ElementMatcher, and the MaybeNull annotation. There is no evidence of incoming/outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions that would make it a hub; its responsibilities are narrowly scoped to matching and applying field visitor wrappers."
