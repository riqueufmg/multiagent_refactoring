    "justification": "The class has only a small number of dependencies: an internal call to its own add(int,int) method, a call to java.lang.System.out.println, and instantiation in main. There is no large fan-in or fan-out (no many incoming or outgoing dependencies to numerous other abstractions), so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
