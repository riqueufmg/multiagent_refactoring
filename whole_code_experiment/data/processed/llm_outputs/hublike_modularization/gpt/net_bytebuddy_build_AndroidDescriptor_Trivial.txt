    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Trivial is a small enum implementing AndroidDescriptor with only two constants (LOCAL, EXTERNAL), a single TypeScope field, a constructor, and a getTypeScope(TypeDescription) method. Its referenced types are limited to the nested TypeScope enum, the TypeDescription parameter, and the enclosing AndroidDescriptor interface. There are no many incoming or outgoing dependencies or connections to a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
