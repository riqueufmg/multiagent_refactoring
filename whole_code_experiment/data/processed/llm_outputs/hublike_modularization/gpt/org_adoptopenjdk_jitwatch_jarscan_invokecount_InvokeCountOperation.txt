    "detection": false,
    "justification": "InvokeCountOperation has a small, focused set of dependencies and is not acting as a central hub. Outgoing dependencies: IJarScanOperation (interface), InvokeMethodCountMap (internal helper), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode, BytecodeInstruction, MemberBytecode, ParseUtil and java.util.List. Incoming dependency: JarScan instantiates/uses InvokeCountOperation when selecting the invokecount operation. The number of distinct abstractions it depends on is small and its role is single-purpose (counting invoke instructions), so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
