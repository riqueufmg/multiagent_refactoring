    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Compaction is a small enum (AUTO, TEXT, BYTE, NUMERIC) referenced by a handful of classes: PDF417 (field compaction, setCompaction(), generateBarcodeLogic()), PDF417Writer (reads hint and calls Compaction.valueOf), PDF417HighLevelEncoder (method parameter and switch on compaction), and PDF417HighLevelEncoderTestAdapter (test passthrough). It has no outgoing dependencies (it does not depend on other abstractions) and the number of incoming references is small and expected for a shared enum. Therefore it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
