    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MethodStrictness has only a small number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Outgoing: it implements ModifierContributor.ForMethod and ModifierContributor.ForType (nested marker interfaces) and uses ModifierContributor.EMPTY_MASK and org.objectweb.asm.Opcodes.ACC_STRICT. Incoming: it is referenced by ModifierReviewable.ForMethodDescription (return type of getMethodStrictness()) and implemented/used in ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase.getMethodStrictness(). These constitute only a few direct relationships, so MethodStrictness does not act as a hub-like abstraction with many incoming and outgoing dependencies."
