    "detection": true,
    "justification": "CaptureActivity acts as a central hub with many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Outgoing dependencies (it directly uses/instantiates or calls into): CameraManager, ViewfinderView, HistoryManager, InactivityTimer, BeepManager, AmbientLightManager, ScanFromWebPageManager, DecodeFormatManager, DecodeHintManager, ClipboardInterface, SupplementalInfoRetriever, ResultHandlerFactory, CaptureActivityHandler, Intent/Intents, various Android UI classes and resources (e.g. ImageView/TextView), and many ZXing core types (Result, BarcodeFormat, ResultMetadataType, ResultPoint). Examples: onResume() creates CameraManager, HistoryManager, InactivityTimer/BeepManager/AmbientLightManager; handleDecode() calls ResultHandlerFactory.makeResultHandler and SupplementalInfoRetriever; maybeSetClipboard() calls ClipboardInterface; initCamera() creates CaptureActivityHandler. Incoming dependencies (many other components depend on CaptureActivity): DecodeThread/DecodeHandler and CaptureActivityHandler are constructed with a CaptureActivity reference and call back into it (activity.getCameraManager(), activity.getHandler(), activity.handleDecode(), activity.drawViewfinder()); various ResultHandler implementations receive the CaptureActivity (or Activity) and invoke CaptureActivity APIs (e.g. WifiResultHandler stores parent = activity and calls parent.restartPreviewAfterDelay). The class coordinates UI, camera, decoding, history, clipboard, light control, sound/vibration, intent handling and inter-component messaging, producing high coupling to numerous abstractions. This wide bidirectional coupling (numerous collaborators both using and being used by CaptureActivity) matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
