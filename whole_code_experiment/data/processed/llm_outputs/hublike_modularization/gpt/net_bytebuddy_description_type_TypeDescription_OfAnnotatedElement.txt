    "detection": true,
    "justification": "This abstraction functions as a central hub: the TypeDescription hierarchy (and its inner/nested types) depends on a very large number of other abstractions and APIs and exposes many subtypes used across the module. Evidence of high coupling/outgoing dependencies: imports and usages of net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList/AnnotationSource/AnnotationDescription, FieldDescription/FieldList, MethodDescription/MethodList/ParameterDescription, RecordComponentDescription/RecordComponentList, TypeList/TypeVariableSource, ModuleDescription, ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.utility classes (CompoundList, FieldComparator, JavaType), JavaDispatcher, ASM types (org.objectweb.asm.Type, SignatureVisitor, SignatureWriter), extensive java.lang.reflect types (Method, Field, Constructor, TypeVariable, ParameterizedType, GenericArrayType, WildcardType, AnnotatedType, AnnotatedParameterizedType, AnnotatedWildcardType), Proxy/InvocationHandler and security/privilege utilities. Evidence of high incoming coupling / hub role: the class defines numerous nested classes and factories (Generic and its many visitors and subtypes, LazyProxy, OfNonGenericType/ForLoadedType/ForErasure/Latent, OfGenericArray, OfWildcardType, OfParameterizedType, OfTypeVariable, LazyProjection and many projection/reader/delegator variants, ForLoadedType.Dispatcher, SuperTypeLoading and its ClassLoading projections, ArrayProjection, Latent, ForPackageDescription, etc.) that are referenced throughout the type system. The sheer number of distinct concerns (generics processing, annotation reading, reflection bridging, array projection, class loading, signature generation, builder patterns) concentrated in this abstraction indicates it has both many incoming and outgoing relationships, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
