    "detection": true,
    "justification": "FastDateParser exhibits hub-like modularization: it directly depends on a large number of distinct abstractions (high fan-out) and centralizes many interactions (high fan-in). Evidence: (1) Large number of imports and collaborators: java.text.DateFormatSymbols, ParseException, ParsePosition, SimpleDateFormat; java.util.Calendar, Date, Locale, TimeZone, Map/Set/List/TreeSet/TreeMap, Comparator; java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap/ConcurrentHashMap; java.util.regex.Pattern/Matcher; java.util.stream.Stream; and org.apache.commons.lang3 helpers (ArraySorter, CharUtils, LocaleUtils) plus package-specific classes (FastTimeZone, TimeZones). (2) Many nested Strategy classes (Strategy, PatternStrategy, NumberStrategy, TimeZoneStrategy, CaseInsensitiveTextStrategy, ISO8601TimeZoneStrategy, CopyQuotedStrategy, StrategyAndWidth, StrategyParser) which mediate parsing, locale handling, regex building, timezone mapping and calendar updates — making the class the central coordinator for these concerns. (3) Centralized caching and shared state: the CACHES array (ConcurrentMap per Calendar field) and computeIfAbsent usage make this class a hub for locale/field strategy resolution. (4) Wide responsibility surface: pattern parsing, regex construction (simpleQuote/appendDisplayNames), timezone name resolution, century/year adjustments, serialization reinitialization — the class both uses and exposes many pieces of functionality. These elements show the class has many incoming/outgoing dependencies and acts as a central connector, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
