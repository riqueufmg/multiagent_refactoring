    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.DataMatrixSymbolInfo144",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class only extends SymbolInfo and contains a simple constructor (calling super with constants) plus two small overridden methods that return constant values or a simple conditional. It has no fields, no imports of many other types, and no method calls to a large number of other abstractions. There is no evidence in the code of extensive incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
