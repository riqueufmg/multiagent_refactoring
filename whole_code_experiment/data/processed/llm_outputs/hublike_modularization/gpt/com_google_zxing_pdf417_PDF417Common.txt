    "detection": true,
    "justification": "PDF417Common acts as a central hub: it exposes large static tables and many constants (SYMBOL_TABLE, CODEWORD_TABLE, NUMBER_OF_CODEWORDS, MAX_CODEWORDS_IN_BARCODE, MODULES_IN_CODEWORD, MODULES_IN_STOP_PATTERN, BARS_IN_MODULE, MIN_ROWS_IN_BARCODE, MAX_ROWS_IN_BARCODE, etc.) and utility methods (getCodeword, toIntArray, getBitCountSum). Numerous other abstractions across packages depend on it (incoming dependencies), e.g. com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder, PDF417CodewordDecoder, DetectionResult, DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn, BarcodeValue, com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Reader, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ModulusGF, and others reference its constants, arrays and methods. It also has outgoing dependencies (calls to com.google.zxing.common.detector.MathUtils.sum, java.util.Arrays.binarySearch and uses java.util.Collection), so there are both incoming and outgoing links. Because it is referenced by many unrelated classes across packages and centrally provides widely used data and utilities, this constitutes a hub-like modularization smell."
