    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForRetainedElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a small, focused materializable implementation with very few dependencies: it holds a single Source.Element field and its materialize(...) method only invokes sink.retain(element). Its direct type dependencies are limited to Source.Element, Target.Sink and standard collection/exception types (List, Map, String, IOException). It is created in a small number of places (e.g. returned from the Preprocessor's Resolved/Ignored paths) rather than being referenced widely across many abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (it neither depends on nor is depended on by a large number of other abstractions)."
