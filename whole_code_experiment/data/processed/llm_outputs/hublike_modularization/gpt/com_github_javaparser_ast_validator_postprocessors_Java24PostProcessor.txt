    "justification": "The class is a trivial empty subclass (extends Java23PostProcessor) and contains no fields, methods, or additional imports. Outgoing dependencies are limited to a single superclass (Java23PostProcessor). There is no evidence in the analyzed code of a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
