    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy.ForBootstrapInjection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ForBootstrapInjection has only a few direct dependencies: java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation and java.io.File (constructor fields) and the ClassInjector abstraction (used to choose between ClassInjector.UsingInstrumentation.of(...) and new ClassInjector.UsingReflection(classLoader) and then call inject(types)). It is a small delegating implementation (selects an injector and delegates load/inject) and does not maintain incoming/outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
