    "justification": "The class MethodNameEqualityResolver is a simple enum implementing AmbiguityResolver with a single method 'resolve'. It has minimal dependencies, only depending on MethodDescription and MethodDelegationBinder.MethodBinding from the same package. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has a very limited and focused responsibility with few incoming and outgoing dependencies."
