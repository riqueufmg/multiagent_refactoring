    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class EscapeConsumer has only two methods (smallEnoughToInline and tooBigToInline) and no dependencies on other classes except for Integer, which is a standard library class. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of dependencies either incoming or outgoing."
