    "justification": "The Intents class is a central hub containing numerous constants and nested classes (Scan, History, Encode, SearchBookContents, WifiConnect, Share) that are used across various parts of the application. It serves as a dependency for BookmarkPickerActivity, which uses the FLAG_NEW_DOC constant. The class encapsulates API constants and intent-related utilities, making it a high-dependency abstraction that many components rely on for inter-activity communication and intent handling."
