    "justification": "The class PolymorphismTest does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of dependencies with other abstractions. It contains a simple interface Coin and three implementing classes (Nickel, Dime, Quarter) which are all internal to the class. The dependencies are limited to these internal components and do not extend to numerous external abstractions. The class itself only interacts with its own nested classes and standard Java classes (System, String[])."
