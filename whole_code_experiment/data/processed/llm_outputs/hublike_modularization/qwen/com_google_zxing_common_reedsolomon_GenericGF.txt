    "detection": true,
    "justification": "GenericGF has extensive dependencies with multiple other classes in the system. It is used by GenericGFPoly (same package) which depends on it for field operations. It's also used by ReedSolomonDecoder and ReedSolomonEncoder for error correction operations. Additionally, it's referenced by multiple decoder classes across different packages: Decoder in maxiode, qrcode, datamatrix, and aztec modules. The class defines several static final fields that reference specific Galois Field instances (AZTEC_DATA_12, AZTEC_DATA_10, etc.) which are consumed by various encoder/decoder implementations. This creates a hub-like pattern where GenericGF serves as a central dependency for multiple modules across the codebase."
