    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForNullValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ForNullValue is a nested class within InvokeDynamic and has a single responsibility: to provide an argument provider for null values of a specified type. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has a very specific and limited set of dependencies, primarily relying on TypeDescription and StackManipulation, and does not act as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions. Its dependencies are minimal and focused on its specific functionality."
