    "justification": "The LazyParameterDescription class does not exhibit hub-like modularization. It has a focused responsibility of describing method parameters lazily within the type pool system. Its dependencies are limited to core ByteBuddy interfaces and classes related to parameter descriptions, method descriptions, and type pooling. It does not act as a central hub connecting to a large number of unrelated abstractions."
