    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The DirectoryProperty interface has a limited number of dependencies. It extends Provider<Directory> and interacts with File, FileTree, and Provider types. While it is used by ByteBuddyTaskConfiguration, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it doesn't have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The interface itself is relatively focused in scope, serving as a specialized provider for directory-related functionality."
