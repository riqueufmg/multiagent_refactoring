    "justification": "The class AttributeNameHistoWalker has limited dependencies - it depends on IMetaMember and IReadOnlyJITDataModel interfaces for its core functionality, and extends AbstractHistoVisitable. It does not show excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class has a focused responsibility of walking histogram data based on attribute names, and its dependency pattern is typical for a specialized utility class rather than a hub-like component."
