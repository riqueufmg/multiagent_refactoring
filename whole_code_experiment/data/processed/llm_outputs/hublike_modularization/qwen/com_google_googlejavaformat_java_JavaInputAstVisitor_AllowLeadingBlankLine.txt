    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JavaInputAstVisitor has a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing. It imports numerous classes from different packages (e.g., com.google.common.collect, com.sun.source.tree, com.sun.tools.javac.tree, java.util, etc.), indicating a high number of outgoing dependencies. Additionally, it contains a vast amount of code (over 58,000 lines as per CONTEXT_SIZE) with many methods visiting different AST node types, suggesting it is a central component with high incoming dependencies from the rest of the system. This central role and extensive interaction with various other components indicate Hub-like Modularization."
