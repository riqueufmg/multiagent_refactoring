    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The ResolvedRecordDeclaration interface has a limited number of dependencies. It extends three interfaces: ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ResolvedTypeParametrizable, and HasAccessSpecifier. It also references a few types such as ResolvedReferenceType, List, Optional, and ResolvedConstructorDeclaration. These dependencies are not excessive and are typical for a specialized declaration interface. There are no significant incoming or outgoing dependency relationships that would classify it as hub-like modularization."
