    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ConstructorResolutionLogic has a limited set of dependencies. It primarily interacts with core type resolution classes such as ResolvedConstructorDeclaration, TypeSolver, SymbolReference, and ResolvedType. It does not exhibit a high number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize hub-like modularization. Its role is focused on constructor resolution logic, and it does not act as a central hub connecting numerous other abstractions."
