    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.TextParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TextParsedResult has a direct dependency only on its superclass ParsedResult and the enum ParsedResultType. It does not show a large number of dependencies either incoming or outgoing, which would be indicative of Hub-like Modularization. The class is simple, encapsulating only text and language properties, and does not act as a hub connecting multiple abstractions."
