    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.BlockParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BlockParsedResult has a simple design with only two fields and corresponding getters. It is used as a data holder class with minimal logic. It has incoming dependencies from GeneralAppIdDecoder but does not have outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions. It interacts directly with only DecodedInformation, which is a straightforward relationship and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
