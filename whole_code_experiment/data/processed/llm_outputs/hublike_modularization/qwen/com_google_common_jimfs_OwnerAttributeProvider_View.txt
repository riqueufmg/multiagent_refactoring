    "justification": "The class OwnerAttributeProvider.View has a limited number of dependencies. It implements the FileOwnerAttributeView interface and interacts primarily with FileLookup and the file attribute system through well-defined methods like getOwner and setOwner. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
