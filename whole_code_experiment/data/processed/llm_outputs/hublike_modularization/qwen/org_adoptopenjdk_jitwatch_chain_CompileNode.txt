    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CompileNode has a limited number of dependencies. It primarily interacts with a few core classes: Compilation, IMetaMember, IParseDictionary, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, and ParseUtil. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization. Its role is well-defined as a node in the compilation chain, encapsulating method call information and maintaining parent-child relationships in a tree structure."
