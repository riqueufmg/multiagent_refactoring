    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.SuperMethodCall.TerminationHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The TerminationHandler enum is a nested enum within SuperMethodCall and has very limited responsibilities. It only defines two enum constants (RETURNING and DROPPING) and one abstract method 'of' that returns a StackManipulation. It does not have a large number of dependencies either incoming or outgoing to other abstractions. The class is tightly focused on handling termination behavior for super method calls, and its usage is confined within the SuperMethodCall class hierarchy. Therefore, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
