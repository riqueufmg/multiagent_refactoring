    "justification": "The class MethodAccessorFactory.Illegal is a minimal implementation consisting only of a singleton enum instance and methods that throw exceptions. It does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, nor does it centralize functionality or act as a hub for interactions. It serves a very specific and limited role as an illegal implementation placeholder, without accumulating incoming or outgoing dependencies."
