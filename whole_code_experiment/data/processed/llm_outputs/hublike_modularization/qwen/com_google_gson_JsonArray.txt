    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The JsonArray class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It has a focused responsibility of representing a JSON array and provides methods for array manipulation. Its dependencies are limited to core JSON element types (JsonElement, JsonNull, JsonPrimitive) and standard Java collections (ArrayList, Iterator, List). It does not have excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class is well-encapsulated and follows single responsibility principle without acting as a central hub connecting numerous unrelated components."
