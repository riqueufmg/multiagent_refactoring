        "The class 'ParameterList' is an interface that defines a core abstraction for handling method and constructor parameters, with multiple nested classes implementing different aspects of parameter handling.",
        "It has numerous incoming dependencies as it is a central abstraction used throughout the codebase for representing parameter lists in various contexts (loaded executables, explicit descriptions, tokens, etc.).",
        "It has many outgoing dependencies to other core abstractions such as 'ParameterDescription', 'TypeList', 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'AnnotationList', 'ByteCodeElement', and various utility classes like 'JavaDispatcher', 'AccessControllerPlugin', etc.",
        "The class contains multiple nested classes ('AbstractBase', 'ForLoadedExecutable', 'Explicit', 'ForTokens', 'TypeSubstituting', 'Empty') which increases its complexity and dependency surface.",
        "Its role as a hub is evident from its extensive use of other major components in the library and its responsibility for coordinating different aspects of parameter representation and transformation."
