    "justification": "The ParserConfiguration class exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies and central role in the JavaParser architecture. It has numerous incoming dependencies from classes like JavaParser, StaticJavaParser, SourceRoot, and various generator classes which rely on its configuration capabilities. It also has substantial outgoing dependencies to many core components including LanguageLevel enum with its validators and post-processors, UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider, LineEndingProcessingProvider, SymbolResolver, CommentsInserter, and various AST node types. The class serves as a central configuration hub that coordinates parsing behavior, validation, and processing steps, making it a highly connected node in the system's dependency graph with both high fan-in (incoming dependencies) and high fan-out (outgoing dependencies)."
