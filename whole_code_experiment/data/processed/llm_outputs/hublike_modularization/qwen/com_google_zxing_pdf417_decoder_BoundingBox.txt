    "justification": "The BoundingBox class has a limited number of dependencies. It primarily interacts with core classes such as ResultPoint and BitMatrix for storing and manipulating bounding box coordinates and image data. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization. Its role is well-defined and encapsulated within the PDF417 decoder package, without acting as a central hub connecting numerous other abstractions."
