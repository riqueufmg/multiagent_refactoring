    "justification": "The class has limited dependencies, only interacting with a few other classes such as SourceRoot, MethodDeclaration, BlockStmt, BaseNodeMetaModel, PropertyMetaModel, and CompilationUnit. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
