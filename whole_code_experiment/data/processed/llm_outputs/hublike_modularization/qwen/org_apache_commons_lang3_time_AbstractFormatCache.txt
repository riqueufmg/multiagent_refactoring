    "justification": [
        "The class AbstractFormatCache is central to formatting operations and is tightly coupled with multiple other classes in the time package, such as FastDateFormat and TimeZones.",
        "It manages caching mechanisms through ConcurrentHashMaps for format instances, indicating a high level of responsibility and coordination.",
        "It interacts directly with LocaleUtils for locale handling and TimeZones for timezone conversions, showing dependencies on external utilities.",
        "Its abstract nature requires concrete implementations (like in FastDateFormat) to provide specific formatting logic, making it a hub for formatting-related functionalities.",
        "The class exposes multiple public and package-protected methods that are accessed by various parts of the library, increasing its incoming dependencies.",
        "It uses complex key structures (ArrayKey) for caching, suggesting a sophisticated internal mechanism that other classes rely upon."
