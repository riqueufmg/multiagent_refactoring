    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithoutBody",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.WithoutBody' has a large number of dependencies both in terms of imports and internal nested classes/interfaces. It interacts with numerous other abstractions such as FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool, and their respective Records and Entries. Additionally, it has complex relationships with other core classes like Implementation, AnnotationValueFilter, ByteCodeAppender, and various ASM types. The class also contains multiple nested classes that further increase its dependency footprint. This extensive web of incoming and outgoing dependencies classifies it as a hub-like modularization smell."
