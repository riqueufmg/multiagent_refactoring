        "The class 'Token' is an abstract class that serves as the base for multiple token types (e.g., Doctype, Tag, StartTag, EndTag, Comment, Character, XmlDecl, EOF), indicating high incoming dependencies.",
        "It directly or indirectly interacts with several other classes such as 'Attributes', 'Range', 'TreeBuilder', 'CharacterReader', 'ParseSettings', and 'Normalizer', showing significant outgoing dependencies.",
        "Its nested subclasses like 'Tag' and its derivatives have complex relationships with external components, especially through the 'TreeBuilder' reference and attribute handling mechanisms.",
        "The class encapsulates functionality that spans across parsing logic, data representation, and source range tracking, making it a central hub in the parsing module."
