    "justification": "NodeWithTypeParameters is an interface with minimal dependencies. It defines a contract for nodes that can have type parameters and only directly interacts with core types like NodeList and TypeParameter. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has limited incoming and outgoing dependencies."
