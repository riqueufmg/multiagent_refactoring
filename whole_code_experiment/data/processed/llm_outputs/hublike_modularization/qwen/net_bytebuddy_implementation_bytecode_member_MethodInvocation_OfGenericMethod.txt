        "It interacts with multiple classes from different packages such as net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.TypeCasting, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType, org.objectweb.asm.MethodVisitor, and org.objectweb.asm.Opcodes.",
        "It also contains several inner classes (IllegalInvocation, OfGenericMethod, Invocation, HandleInvocation) that further increase its dependencies and complexity.",
        "The class is an enum with multiple constants (VIRTUAL, INTERFACE, STATIC, SPECIAL, SPECIAL_CONSTRUCTOR, VIRTUAL_PRIVATE, INTERFACE_PRIVATE) each representing different types of method invocations, which increases its complexity and dependency footprint.",
        "It uses annotations like @HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin.Enhance indicating it's part of a complex framework structure."
