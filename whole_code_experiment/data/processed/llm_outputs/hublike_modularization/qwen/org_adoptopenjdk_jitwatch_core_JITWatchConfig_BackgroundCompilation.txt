    "justification": "The class JITWatchConfig does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It is a self-contained configuration management class with a single responsibility of handling application settings. Its dependencies are limited to standard Java utilities (java.io, java.util), logging (com.chrisnewland.freelogj), and internal utilities (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil) and model classes (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.ParsedClasspath). It does not act as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have excessive incoming and outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
