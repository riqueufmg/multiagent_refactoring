    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class AsmClassReader.Default has extensive dependencies both incoming and outgoing. It interacts with multiple classes such as OpenedClassReader, ClassFileVersion, and AsmClassReader.ForClassFileApi. It also references several external libraries like org.objectweb.asm.ClassReader and codes.rafael.asmjdkbridge.JdkClassReader. Additionally, it uses various utility classes from the same package and other packages within the project, indicating a central role in managing class reading mechanisms which results in high coupling and multiple dependencies."
