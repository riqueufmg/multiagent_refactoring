    "justification": "The class TypePatternSymbolDeclarator has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on TypePatternExpr, TypeSolver, ResolvedValueDeclaration, and JavaParserSymbolDeclaration. These dependencies are focused and directly related to its role as a symbol declarator for type patterns. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
