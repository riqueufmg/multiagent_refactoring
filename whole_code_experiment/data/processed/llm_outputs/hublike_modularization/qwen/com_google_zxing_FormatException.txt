    "justification": "The FormatException class is a simple exception class with minimal dependencies. It extends ReaderException and is primarily used to signal formatting errors in barcode decoding. It does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, nor does it act as a central hub connecting many other classes or modules. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
