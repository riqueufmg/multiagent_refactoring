    "class": "InnerClassDotExpressions",

    "justification": "The class InnerClassDotExpressions only has outgoing dependencies to InnerClassContainer and its nested classes through static method calls. It does not have a large number of dependencies with other abstractions, nor does it serve as a hub connecting multiple unrelated components. The class simply demonstrates usage of nested class hierarchies with dot notation access."
