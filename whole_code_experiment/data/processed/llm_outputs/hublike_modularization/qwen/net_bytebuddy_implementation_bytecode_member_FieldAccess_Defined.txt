    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FieldAccess has high cohesion with multiple inner classes (OfGenericField, AccessDispatcher, AbstractFieldInstruction, FieldGetInstruction, FieldPutInstruction) and static methods (forEnumeration, forField) that tightly interact with each other. It encapsulates a large amount of functionality related to field access operations, creating a hub for field-related bytecode manipulations. The class directly depends on numerous external abstractions such as FieldDescription, TypeDefinition, StackManipulation, and ASM's MethodVisitor and Opcodes, while also being depended upon by other parts of the system for field access operations. This centralization of field access logic with extensive incoming and outgoing dependencies qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
