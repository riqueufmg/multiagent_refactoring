    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has numerous dependencies on external JMH framework classes (InfraControl, ThreadParams, BenchmarkTaskResult, RawResults, Blackhole, etc.) and also depends on ClassByExtensionBenchmark_jmhType for the benchmark execution. Additionally, it is responsible for coordinating and managing the entire benchmark execution lifecycle, handling different benchmark modes (Throughput, AverageTime, SampleTime, SingleShotTime), which makes it a central hub connecting multiple abstractions and frameworks together."
