    "justification": "The class ForClassFileTransformer has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer for delegation, uses net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin for enhancement annotation, and references some utility classes from net.bytebuddy.utility.nullability. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
