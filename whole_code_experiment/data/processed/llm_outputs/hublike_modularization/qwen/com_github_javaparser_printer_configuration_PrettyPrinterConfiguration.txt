    "justification": "The PrettyPrinterConfiguration class exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies and central role in the printing configuration system. It directly interacts with multiple core classes including Indentation, DefaultPrinterConfiguration, ConfigurationOption, and various enums like ConfigOption and IndentType. It also serves as a key configuration class that is referenced by major components such as PrettyPrintVisitor and SourcePrinter, making it a central hub that both depends on and is depended upon by numerous other abstractions. Its deprecated status and role as a wrapper around DefaultPrinterConfiguration further indicate its hub-like characteristics, acting as a central point of access and coordination between different parts of the printer configuration ecosystem."
