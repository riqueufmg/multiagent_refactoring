    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.ExtensionFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The ExtensionFileComparator class has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on java.io.File, java.io.Serializable, java.util.Comparator from the Java standard library, and on org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils and org.apache.commons.io.IOCase from the same project. It does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize it as a hub-like module. Its role is specific and well-defined, focusing only on comparing file extensions."
