    "justification": "The VariableDeclaratorContext class has minimal dependencies. It depends on a few classes such as VariableDeclarator, TypeSolver, and Node, but not on a large number of other abstractions. Additionally, it is not depended upon by many other classes. Therefore, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
