    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The SourceRoot class exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies and interactions with numerous other classes. It directly imports and utilizes classes like JavaParser, ParseResult, CompilationUnit, ParserConfiguration, and various utility classes from the JavaParser library. Additionally, it interacts with classes such as Path, Files, and ForkJoinPool from the Java standard library for file operations and parallel processing. The class also defines inner classes (Callback, ParallelParse) that further increase its complexity and dependency footprint. Its central role in managing source file parsing, caching, and saving creates a hub for interactions within the JavaParser ecosystem, making it a central point of coupling for many other abstractions."
