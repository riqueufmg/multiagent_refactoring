    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.invokecount.InvokeCountOperation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.IJarScanOperation (interface it implements), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.ParseUtil. It also uses InvokeMethodCountMap which is in the same package. This is a reasonable set of dependencies for its functionality as a jar scan operation that counts method invocations. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it doesn't have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
