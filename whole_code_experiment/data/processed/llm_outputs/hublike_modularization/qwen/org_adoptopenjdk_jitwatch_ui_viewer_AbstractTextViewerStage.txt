    "justification": "The class AbstractTextViewerStage has a limited number of dependencies. It directly depends on Viewer and UserInterfaceUtil, and is part of a UI module with clearly defined responsibilities. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
