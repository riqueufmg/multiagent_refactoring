    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Compound class has a single responsibility of chaining several ClassFileLocator instances and querying them in order until one can provide a class file. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it doesn't have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Its purpose is narrowly focused on composition of locators, and it only interacts directly with the ClassFileLocator interface and its implementations through the standard list and iteration patterns. The class doesn't show excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize hub-like modularization."
