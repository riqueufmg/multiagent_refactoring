    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class AbstractWatchService does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It is an abstract class that provides a basic implementation of WatchService and defines internal classes Event and Key. The dependencies observed are standard Java library types (e.g., BlockingQueue, AtomicBoolean) and self-contained inner classes. There are no excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the structure is cohesive and focused on watch service functionality."
