{
    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The JsonParser class has a limited and focused set of dependencies. It primarily interacts with JsonReader, JsonElement, and related exception classes (JsonSyntaxException, JsonIOException) within the same package. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization. The class serves a single responsibility of parsing JSON text into JsonElement objects and maintains a cohesive set of methods for this purpose. While it is used by other classes like RawCollectionsExample, its own dependency footprint remains constrained to core JSON parsing functionality."
