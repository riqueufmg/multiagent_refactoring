    "justification": "The ErrorCorrection class has a limited number of dependencies. It primarily interacts with ModulusGF and ModulusPoly within the same package, and throws ChecksumException. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize hub-like modularization."
