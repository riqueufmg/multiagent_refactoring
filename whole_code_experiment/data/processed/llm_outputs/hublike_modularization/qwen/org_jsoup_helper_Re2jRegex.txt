    "justification": "The class Re2jRegex has a limited number of dependencies. It extends Regex and uses com.google.re2j.Pattern and com.google.re2j.Matcher internally. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions, thus does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
