    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.comparators.MethodComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MethodComparator has a limited number of dependencies. It directly interacts with ParameterComparator and ClassComparator through instantiation and method calls, and it implements the Comparator interface. There are no significant incoming or outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which would be indicative of Hub-like Modularization. The class is focused on comparing Method objects and delegates parameter and class comparison to dedicated comparators, maintaining a clear and limited scope of responsibility."
