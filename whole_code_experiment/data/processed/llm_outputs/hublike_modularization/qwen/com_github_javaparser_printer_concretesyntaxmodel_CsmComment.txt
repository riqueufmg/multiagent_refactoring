    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmComment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CsmComment has minimal dependencies. It depends on Comment and SourcePrinter for its functionality and is only depended upon by CsmOrphanCommentsEnding. This does not indicate a hub-like modularization pattern as it does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies."
