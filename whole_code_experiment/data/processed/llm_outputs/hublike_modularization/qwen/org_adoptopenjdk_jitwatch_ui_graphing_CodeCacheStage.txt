    "justification": "The CodeCacheStage class has a moderate number of dependencies but does not exhibit hub-like modularization. It primarily depends on javafx classes for UI functionality, uses UserInterfaceUtil for scene creation, interacts with JITWatchUI for data model access, and works with CodeCacheEvent and Tag for data representation. While it has several incoming and outgoing dependencies, the number is not excessive relative to its responsibilities in displaying code cache information graphically. The class focuses on a single responsibility of visualizing code cache events and does not act as a central hub coordinating numerous unrelated components."
