    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.CompositeFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CompositeFileComparator has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on standard Java classes (File, Serializable, Arrays, Comparator, IntFunction, Stream, StreamSupport) and only interacts with Comparator<File> instances passed to it. It does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions in the codebase, thus does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
