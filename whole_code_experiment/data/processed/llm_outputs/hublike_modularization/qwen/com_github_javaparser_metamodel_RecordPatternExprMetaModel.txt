    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class RecordPatternExprMetaModel has a limited number of dependencies. It extends PatternExprMetaModel, and has two PropertyMetaModel fields referencing Modifier and ComponentPatternExpr. It also interacts with RecordPatternExpr in the constructor. These relationships are not extensive enough to qualify as hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
