    "justification": "The class 'Implementation' has a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing. It interacts with numerous other abstractions such as 'InstrumentedType', 'ByteCodeAppender', 'SpecialMethodInvocation', 'Target', 'Context', 'AuxiliaryType', 'ClassFileVersion', and various ASM library classes. It also defines multiple nested interfaces and classes that increase its connectivity within the system, making it a hub for interactions."
