    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class Plugin.ForRetainedElement is an interface that defines a contract for plugins that can retain elements during transformation. It does not contain implementation code that would indicate hub-like dependencies. The interface defines methods for applying plugins and handling preprocessing but does not itself depend on or interact with a large number of other abstractions directly. The complexity and dependencies arise from its usage within the Plugin.Engine framework, but the interface itself is not hub-like in its modularization."
