    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodCall' has dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. It interacts with numerous classes and interfaces such as 'Implementation', 'TargetHandler', 'MethodInvoker', 'TerminationHandler', 'ArgumentLoader', 'MethodLocator', and many others through its fields, method parameters, and return types. Additionally, it contains multiple nested classes and interfaces that further increase its connectivity and dependency on other parts of the system, making it a hub-like modularization."
