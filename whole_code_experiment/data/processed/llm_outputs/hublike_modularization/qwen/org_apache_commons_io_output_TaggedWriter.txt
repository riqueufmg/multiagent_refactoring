    "justification": "The class TaggedWriter has a focused responsibility as a decorator for Writer instances, adding tagging functionality to IO exceptions. It depends primarily on TaggedIOException for its core behavior, and this dependency is well-encapsulated and purposeful. There are no excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies with a large number of abstractions; the coupling is limited and intentional, serving its specific role in the IO tagging mechanism."
