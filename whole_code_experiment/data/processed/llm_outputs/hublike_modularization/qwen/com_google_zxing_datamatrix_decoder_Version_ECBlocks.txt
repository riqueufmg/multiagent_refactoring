    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Version",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Version class encapsulates data related to Data Matrix code versions and provides a method to deduce version information from dimensions. It has a clear, single responsibility. While it contains nested classes (ECBlocks and ECB), these are tightly related and used exclusively within the context of versioning. The class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies with other abstractions, nor does it act as a central hub connecting many unrelated components. Therefore, it does not demonstrate Hub-like Modularization."
