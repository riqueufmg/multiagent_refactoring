    "justification": "The class VariableDeclarationExprMetaModel has a limited number of dependencies. It extends ExpressionMetaModel and contains only four properties, each of which is a PropertyMetaModel. These properties represent the core attributes of a variable declaration expression: annotations, modifiers, variables, and maximum common type. There are no extensive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
