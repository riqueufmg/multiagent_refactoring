    "justification": "The class has a limited number of dependencies and does not act as a hub connecting to many other abstractions. It primarily interacts with core Android classes like DexClassLoader and standard Java utilities. The class serves a specific purpose of wrapping class loading functionality without creating a central dependency hub."
