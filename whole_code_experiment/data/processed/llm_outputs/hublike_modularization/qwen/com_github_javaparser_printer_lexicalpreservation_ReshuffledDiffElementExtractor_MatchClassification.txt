        "The class has multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies with various abstractions such as NodeText, CsmMix, CsmElement, DifferenceElement, Reshuffled, Added, Removed, Kept, DifferenceElementCalculator, TextElement, CsmToken, ArrayIterator, PeekingIterator, and MatchClassification.",
        "It interacts with concrete syntax model elements (CsmElement, CsmMix, CsmToken) and lexical preservation components (NodeText, TextElement), indicating a central role in coordinating between different modules.",
        "The class uses several utility classes and iterators (ArrayIterator, PeekingIterator) and manages complex data structures like Maps and Lists to orchestrate the reshuffling logic, suggesting it acts as a hub connecting multiple parts of the system."
