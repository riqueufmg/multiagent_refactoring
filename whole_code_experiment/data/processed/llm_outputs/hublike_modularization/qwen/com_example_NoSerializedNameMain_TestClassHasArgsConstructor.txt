    "class": "com.example.NoSerializedNameMain",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class NoSerializedNameMain has limited dependencies; it only interacts with Gson, GsonBuilder, and its own inner classes (TestClassNoArgsConstructor, TestClassNotAbstract, TestClassHasArgsConstructor). It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions, so it does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
