    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Nodes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Nodes does not exhibit hub-like modularization. It is a specialized collection class extending ArrayList<T> with methods operating on Node objects. Its dependencies are limited and focused: it imports core Java utilities (ArrayList, Arrays, Collection, Iterator, List, Predicate, UnaryOperator), jsoup internal utilities (Validate, StringUtil), and jsoup node types (Element, Node). The class interacts primarily with its own type parameters and direct dependencies. There are no extensive incoming or outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class serves a specific purpose within the jsoup library without acting as a central hub connecting numerous unrelated components."
