{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.DefaultValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The DefaultValue class has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on a few constant classes like IntegerConstant, LongConstant, FloatConstant, DoubleConstant, NullConstant, and Trivial, all within the same package. It also interacts with TypeDefinition and Implementation.Context, but the dependency count is not excessively high. The class is an enum with a single responsibility of loading default values onto the stack, and it does not act as a hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
