    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ResolvedWildcard has a limited and focused set of dependencies. It primarily interacts with core type system classes like ResolvedType, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, and Context. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has a constrained number of incoming and outgoing dependencies, and its interactions are confined to its specific role in representing wildcard types within the JavaParser resolution system."
