    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy.ForBootstrapInjection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ForBootstrapInjection has a limited number of dependencies. It directly depends on Instrumentation and File from the Java standard library, and it uses ClassInjector internally, but it does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies. It serves a specific purpose of injecting classes into the bootstrap class loader using instrumentation, and its interface is relatively narrow, thus it does not qualify as a hub-like modularization."
