    "justification": "The class SimpleInliningTest has minimal dependencies - it only depends on System.out.println() and its own add() method. It does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have many incoming dependencies from other classes. The class is self-contained with just a constructor, a simple add method, and a main method, forming a cohesive unit without hub-like characteristics."
