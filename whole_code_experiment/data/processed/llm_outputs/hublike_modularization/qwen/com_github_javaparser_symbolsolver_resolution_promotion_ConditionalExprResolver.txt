    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The ConditionalExprResolver class has a single public static method that acts as a factory for ConditionalExprHandler instances. It depends on 3 other classes/interfaces (ConditionalExprHandler, ResolvedType, ResolvedPrimitiveType) for its functionality, and is depended upon by TypeExtractor. This is a relatively small number of dependencies, and the class serves a very specific, limited purpose (resolving conditional expression types). The dependencies are necessary for its core function and do not indicate hub-like behavior. The class does not act as a central hub connecting to many different modules or abstractions."
