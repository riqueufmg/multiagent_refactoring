    "detection": true,
    "justification": "JavadocWriter has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It directly interacts with Token, NestingCounter, and JavadocFormatter classes. It also uses multiple enums (RequestedWhitespace, AutoIndent) and static imports from various classes including JavadocWriter itself, indicating both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The class handles numerous token types and formatting logic, making it a central hub for Javadoc formatting operations."
