    "justification": "The class SMSTOMMSTOResultParser has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on com.google.zxing.Result for input parsing and com.google.zxing.client.result.SMSParsedResult for creating the parsed result. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
