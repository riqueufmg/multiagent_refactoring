    "justification": "The class JavacTokens does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It is a final class with a single public static method 'getTokens' and encapsulates related functionality for tokenizing Java source code. Its dependencies are limited to standard Java libraries (java.util, com.sun.tools.javac.parser, com.sun.tools.javac.util) and Google's Guava library (com.google.common.collect, com.google.common.base). The class contains several private static helper methods and inner classes that support its main functionality, indicating cohesive design rather than being a hub connecting to many unrelated abstractions. The class has a clear, single responsibility of lexing Java code and preserving comments, without acting as a central hub connecting numerous unrelated components."
