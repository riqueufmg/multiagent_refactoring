    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The HasSuperTypeMatcher class has limited dependencies. It primarily depends on core ByteBuddy classes like ElementMatcher, TypeDefinition, TypeDescription, and QueueFactory for its core functionality. It doesn't show hub-like modularization characteristics as it's focused on a single responsibility - matching super types. The dependency relationships are straightforward and don't indicate excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize a hub-like module."
