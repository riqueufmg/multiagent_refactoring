    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class PathURLConnection has a limited number of dependencies. It primarily interacts with standard Java classes such as URLConnection, Path, Files, URI, and some Guava utilities. There is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization. The class is focused on its specific responsibility of handling URL connections for paths and does not act as a central hub connecting to numerous other abstractions."
