    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.SimplePathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class SimplePathVisitor has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on IOBiFunction for its visitFileFailedFunction and extends SimpleFileVisitor<Path> while implementing PathVisitor. It is also extended by CountingPathVisitor, but does not show excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would classify it as hub-like modularization. The class serves a specific abstraction for file visiting and does not act as a central hub connecting to numerous other abstractions."
