    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.ChildTextElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ChildTextElement has minimal dependencies. It depends on Node and LexicalPreservingPrinter for its core functionality, and it is used by NodeText and LexicalPreservingVisitor. This is a typical pattern for a small, focused class that encapsulates a specific behavior (representing a child node in the lexical preservation context). The number of dependencies is not excessive for its role, and it does not act as a central hub connecting a large number of other classes. It's a helper class with a well-defined, limited scope."
