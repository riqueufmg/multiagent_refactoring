    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.channels.ByteArraySeekableByteChannel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on java.nio.ByteBuffer, java.nio.channels.SeekableByteChannel, java.util.Arrays, java.util.Objects, java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock, and org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization. The class serves a specific purpose as a SeekableByteChannel implementation backed by a byte array and maintains a cohesive responsibility."
