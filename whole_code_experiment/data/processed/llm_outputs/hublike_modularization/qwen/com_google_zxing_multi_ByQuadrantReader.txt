    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ByQuadrantReader has a limited number of dependencies. It primarily interacts with the Reader interface and BinaryBitmap class, along with some core ZXing classes like Result, ResultPoint, and DecodeHintType. It does not exhibit a high number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization. The class serves a specific purpose of decoding barcodes by scanning image quadrants and delegates most of its operations to the injected Reader implementation, maintaining a focused responsibility."
