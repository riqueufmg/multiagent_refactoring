    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender.ForTypeAnnotations",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ForTypeAnnotations' exhibits Hub-like Modularization. It has high incoming and outgoing dependencies: it depends on multiple classes from 'net.bytebuddy.description.type' (e.g., 'TypeDescription', 'TypeList'), 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute' (e.g., 'AnnotationAppender', 'AnnotationValueFilter'), and 'org.objectweb.asm' (e.g., 'TypeReference', 'TypePath'). Additionally, it is depended upon by other parts of the system (as indicated by its role in the annotation processing pipeline). Its central role in handling type annotations for various Java constructs (super class, interfaces, fields, methods, etc.) further reinforces its hub-like nature, connecting multiple abstraction layers."
