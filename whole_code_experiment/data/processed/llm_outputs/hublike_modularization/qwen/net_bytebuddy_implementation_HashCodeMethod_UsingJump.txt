    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.UsingJump",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class HashCodeMethod.UsingJump has a limited and focused set of dependencies. It primarily interacts with classes within the same package (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode) and a few specific classes from other packages (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, org.objectweb.asm.Label). It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with diverse abstractions, which would be characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. The class serves a specific purpose within the Byte Buddy library's bytecode generation framework and maintains a cohesive responsibility."
