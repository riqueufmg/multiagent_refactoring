    "justification": "The class LoopUnroll is a self-contained utility class that encapsulates loop unrolling examples. It has a single responsibility of demonstrating different loop unrolling techniques and does not serve as a hub connecting multiple unrelated abstractions. While it has multiple methods, they are all cohesive and focused on the same purpose - loop unrolling demonstrations. The class has minimal external dependencies (only java.util.Random) and does not act as a central coordinator or mediator between different modules or abstractions."
