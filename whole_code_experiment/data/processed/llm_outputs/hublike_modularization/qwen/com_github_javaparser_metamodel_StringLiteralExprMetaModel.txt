    "justification": "The class StringLiteralExprMetaModel has very limited dependencies. It extends LiteralStringValueExprMetaModel and only interacts with its superclass and the JavaParserMetaModel class where it is registered. It does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions."
