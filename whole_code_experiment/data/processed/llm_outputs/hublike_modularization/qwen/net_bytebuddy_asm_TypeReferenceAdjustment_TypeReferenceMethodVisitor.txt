    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TypeReferenceMethodVisitor has limited responsibilities focused on visiting method-related bytecode instructions and collecting type references. Its dependencies are constrained to core ASM types (e.g., MethodVisitor, AnnotationVisitor, Type, Handle, ConstantDynamic) and internal utility methods for resolving type information. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions, nor does it act as a central hub coordinating multiple modules or subsystems."
