    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The ClassInjector interface and its nested classes have extensive dependencies both incoming and outgoing. It imports and utilizes a large number of other abstractions including com.sun.jna.*, net.bytebuddy.*, java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation, java.lang.reflect.*, java.security.*, java.util.*, java.io.*, java.net.URL, and others. Additionally, it defines multiple nested classes (UsingReflection, UsingLookup, UsingUnsafe, UsingInstrumentation, UsingJna) each with their own complex dependency structures, making the overall modularization hub-like due to the central role and high connectivity of this class in the loading and injection architecture."
