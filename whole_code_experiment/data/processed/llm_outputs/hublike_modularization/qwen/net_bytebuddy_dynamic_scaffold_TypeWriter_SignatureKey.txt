    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The SignatureKey class is a simple, private static nested class with only two fields (internalName and descriptor) and basic equals/hashCode methods. It does not have numerous dependencies or interactions with many other abstractions. It serves a single, focused purpose within the TypeWriter class hierarchy, acting as a key for identifying unique method or field signatures. Its usage is limited to internal operations within the TypeWriter and its nested classes, not exposing a complex API or managing extensive relationships."
