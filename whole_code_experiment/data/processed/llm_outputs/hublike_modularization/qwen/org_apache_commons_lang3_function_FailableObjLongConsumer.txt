    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableObjLongConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FailableObjLongConsumer is a simple functional interface with minimal dependencies. It only references java.util.function.ObjLongConsumer from the standard library and defines a single method 'accept'. It does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions in the codebase. The class also provides a NOP singleton and a static factory method, but these are minimal structural elements that do not indicate hub-like behavior."
