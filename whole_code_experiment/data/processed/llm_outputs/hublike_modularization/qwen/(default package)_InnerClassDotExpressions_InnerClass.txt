    "justification": "The class InnerClassDotExpressions only has outgoing dependencies to InnerClassContainer and its nested classes, but it does not have a large number of dependencies with other abstractions. It simply calls static methods on nested classes in a hierarchical structure. The dependencies are limited and focused, not creating a hub-like pattern with many different abstractions."
