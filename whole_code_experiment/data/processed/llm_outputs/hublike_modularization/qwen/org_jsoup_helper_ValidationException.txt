    "justification": "The class has minimal dependencies - it only imports java.util.ArrayList and java.util.List for internal functionality, and has a simple relationship with Validate class through a constant and documentation reference. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it doesn't have numerous incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions."
