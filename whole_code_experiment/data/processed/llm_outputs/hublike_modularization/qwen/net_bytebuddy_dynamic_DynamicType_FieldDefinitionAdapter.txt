    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.FieldDefinitionAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class is an interface (DynamicType) and its nested interface (FieldDefinitionAdapter). Interfaces do not exhibit hub-like modularization as they merely define contracts without dependencies. The smell Hub-like Modularization refers to abstractions with many incoming and outgoing dependencies, which does not apply to interfaces."
