    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'FieldAttributeAppender.Compound' has a limited number of dependencies. It implements the 'FieldAttributeAppender' interface and interacts with types like 'FieldVisitor', 'FieldDescription', 'AnnotationValueFilter', and 'ArrayList'. It does not exhibit a high number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would classify it as hub-like modularization. Its role is clearly defined as a composite appender, combining multiple appenders, which is a standard design pattern and not indicative of the hub-like smell."
