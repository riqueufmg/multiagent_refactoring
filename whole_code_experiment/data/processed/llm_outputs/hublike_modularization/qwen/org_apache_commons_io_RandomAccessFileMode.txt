    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.RandomAccessFileMode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class RandomAccessFileMode has a limited and well-defined set of dependencies. It primarily interacts with core Java I/O classes such as RandomAccessFile, File, and Path, and a few classes from the same package (org.apache.commons.io) and sub-packages (org.apache.commons.io.function). It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization. The class serves a specific purpose as an enum for random access file modes and encapsulates related functionality without becoming a central hub for unrelated abstractions."
