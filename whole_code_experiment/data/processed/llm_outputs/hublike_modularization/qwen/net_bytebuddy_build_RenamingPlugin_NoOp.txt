    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class RenamingPlugin has a moderate number of dependencies, including imports from net.bytebuddy.asm, net.bytebuddy.description, net.bytebuddy.dynamic, net.bytebuddy.implementation, net.bytebuddy.matcher, net.bytebuddy.pool, and net.bytebuddy.utility. However, these dependencies are cohesive and related to its core responsibility of renaming types during bytecode manipulation. It does not exhibit an excessive number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would classify it as hub-like modularization. The class encapsulates renaming logic effectively and maintains a clear separation of concerns with inner classes like RenamingRemapper and Renaming implementations."
