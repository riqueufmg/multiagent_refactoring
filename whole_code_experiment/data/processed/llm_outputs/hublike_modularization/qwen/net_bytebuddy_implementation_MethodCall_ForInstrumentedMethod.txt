    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodCall' has dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. It interacts with numerous classes and interfaces such as 'Implementation', 'MethodLocator', 'TargetHandler', 'ArgumentLoader', 'MethodInvoker', 'TerminationHandler', 'Assigner', 'StackManipulation', 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'FieldDescription', 'InstrumentedType', and many others. It also has multiple nested classes and interfaces, each with their own set of dependencies, contributing to its hub-like modularization."
