    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription' has a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing. It imports and uses many other classes from the same package and from Java reflection API. It also defines multiple nested classes and interfaces which increases its complexity and dependency. The class serves as a core abstraction for type descriptions in the library, leading to high coupling with other abstractions."
