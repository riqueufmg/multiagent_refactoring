    "justification": "The ServiceDefinition interface is a simple interface with only one method declaration (getValue()). It does not have any dependencies (incoming or outgoing) with other abstractions. It's a minimal interface that defines a contract without any complex dependency relationships, therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization smell."
