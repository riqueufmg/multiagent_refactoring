        "The class has a large number of incoming dependencies, as evidenced by multiple static factory methods (e.g., `of`, `fromInstalledAgent`) that create instances and are likely called from various parts of the system.",
        "It has numerous outgoing dependencies to other abstractions including `Instrumentation`, `Strategy`, `BootstrapInjection`, `TypeDescription`, `ClassFileLocator`, `JavaModule`, `JavaDispatcher`, and various utility classes.",
        "The class interacts with many different components of the ByteBuddy library and Java's instrumentation API, acting as a central coordination point for class reloading functionality.",
        "It contains multiple nested classes (`Strategy`, `BootstrapInjection`) and interfaces (`Dispatcher`) that further increase its connectivity within the module.",
        "The class handles complex logic for class loading, transformation, and injection, making it a hub for coordinating between different subsystems."
