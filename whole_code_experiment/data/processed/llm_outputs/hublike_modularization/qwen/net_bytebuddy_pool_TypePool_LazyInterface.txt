    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyInterface",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class is an interface, not a concrete implementation. Hub-like Modularization refers to a concrete abstraction (class) that has many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Since interfaces define contracts but do not implement behavior, they typically do not exhibit hub-like characteristics in terms of modularization. The smell applies to classes that act as central hubs for dependencies, which is not the case for interfaces."
