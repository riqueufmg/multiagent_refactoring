    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Adapter' has dependencies on a large number of other abstractions through its extensive use of reflection, type adapters, field handling, and JSON streaming components. It interacts with classes such as 'BoundField', 'FieldsData', 'JsonReader', 'JsonWriter', 'TypeAdapter', 'Gson', 'TypeToken', and various reflection helper classes. Additionally, it manages serialization and deserialization logic that requires coordination with multiple internal and external components, making it a hub-like module due to its high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies."
