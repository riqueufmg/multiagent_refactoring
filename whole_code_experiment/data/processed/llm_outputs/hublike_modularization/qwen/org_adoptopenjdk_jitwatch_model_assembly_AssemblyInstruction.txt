    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyInstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class AssemblyInstruction has a moderate number of dependencies. It depends on StringUtil for string formatting and AssemblyLabels for label management. It is used by several other classes like AssemblyBlock, AssemblyParserX86, AssemblyParserARM, and ViewerAssembly. However, the number of dependencies is not excessively high, and the class has a clear, focused responsibility of representing an assembly instruction. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
