    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The InMemoryCache class has a limited number of dependencies. It implements the Cache interface and uses standard Java collections (WeakHashMap, Collections.synchronizedMap). Its outgoing dependencies are minimal and focused on its core caching functionality. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it doesn't have extensive incoming or outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
