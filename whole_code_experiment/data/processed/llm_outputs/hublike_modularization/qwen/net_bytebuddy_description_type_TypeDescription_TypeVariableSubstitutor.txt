    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The TypeVariableSubstitutor class does not exhibit hub-like modularization. It has a focused responsibility for substituting type variables and does not have excessive dependencies (either incoming or outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Its dependencies are limited to core type description classes and generic type handling within the same package, which is appropriate for its role in type variable substitution."
