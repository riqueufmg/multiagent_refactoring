    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class PropagatingAstObserver has a limited number of dependencies. It implements the AstObserver interface and interacts primarily with Node and NodeList classes. It does not exhibit a high number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize hub-like modularization. Its role is specific to propagating observer registrations within the AST structure, and it is used internally by the Node class for observer management, rather than being a central hub for diverse modules or components."
