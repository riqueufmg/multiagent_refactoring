    "justification": "The AmbientLightManager class has a limited number of dependencies. It interacts directly with SensorManager, CameraManager, and FrontLightMode, all of which are necessary for its core functionality of managing ambient light and controlling the front light. The dependencies are cohesive and focused on its responsibility, and it does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize hub-like modularization."
