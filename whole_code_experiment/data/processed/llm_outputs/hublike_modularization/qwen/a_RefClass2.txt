    "class": "a.RefClass2",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class RefClass2 only contains two public fields (unknownName and nonStatic) of type Runnable, but there is no evidence of dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class does not show any incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
