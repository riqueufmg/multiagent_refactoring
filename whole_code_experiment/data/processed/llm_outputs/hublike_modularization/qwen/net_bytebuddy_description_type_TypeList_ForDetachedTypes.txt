    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ForDetachedTypes has a limited and focused set of dependencies. It primarily interacts with TypeDescription.Generic, TypeDescription.Generic.Visitor, and related classes for type detachment and attachment operations. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with diverse abstractions, which would be characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Its role is specific to handling detached types within the type system, and it does not act as a central hub connecting numerous unrelated components."
