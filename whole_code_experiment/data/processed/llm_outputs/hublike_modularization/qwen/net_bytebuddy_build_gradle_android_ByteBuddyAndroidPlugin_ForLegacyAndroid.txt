    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin has extensive dependencies both incoming and outgoing. It interacts with numerous Android Gradle Plugin APIs (e.g., AndroidComponentsExtension, Variant, Artifacts, InstrumentationScope), Gradle core types (Project, Configuration, TaskProvider), and custom ByteBuddy types. It also defines multiple inner classes (VariantAction, RuntimeClassPathResolver, ByteBuddyTransformationConfiguration, etc.) that further increase its connectivity within the module and across abstraction layers. This high number of dependencies indicates a central, hub-like role in the module's architecture."
