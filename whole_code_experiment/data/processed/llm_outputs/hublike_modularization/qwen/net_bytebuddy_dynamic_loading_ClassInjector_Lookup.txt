    "justification": "The ClassInjector interface and its nested classes exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It has extensive dependencies both incoming and outgoing. The class depends on numerous other classes and packages (e.g., com.sun.jna, java.lang.instrument, java.lang.reflect, java.security, java.util, java.util.jar, java.util.zip, net.bytebuddy, org.objectweb.asm) for its various injection mechanisms (Reflection, Unsafe, JNA, Instrumentation, Lookup). Additionally, it is depended upon by other parts of the system for class loading functionalities. The class itself contains multiple nested classes (UsingReflection, UsingLookup, UsingUnsafe, UsingInstrumentation, UsingJna) each handling different injection strategies, making it a central hub for class injection operations."
