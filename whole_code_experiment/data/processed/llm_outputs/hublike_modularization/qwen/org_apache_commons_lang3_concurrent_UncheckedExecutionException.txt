    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class UncheckedExecutionException has minimal dependencies - it extends UncheckedException and imports only ExecutionException and UncheckedException. It does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions, thus does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
