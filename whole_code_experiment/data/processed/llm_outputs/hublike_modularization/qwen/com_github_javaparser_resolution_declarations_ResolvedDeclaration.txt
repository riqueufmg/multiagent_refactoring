    "justification": "ResolvedDeclaration is a core interface that is extended or implemented by numerous other declaration types including ResolvedTypeDeclaration, ResolvedFieldDeclaration, ResolvedParameterDeclaration, ResolvedEnumConstantDeclaration, and ResolvedTypePatternDeclaration. It defines a wide range of default methods for type checking and casting which are widely used across the type system, creating a central hub for declaration-related operations. Its central role in the hierarchy and extensive usage by other classes indicates hub-like modularization."
