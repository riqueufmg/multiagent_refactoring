    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithProxy_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing. It imports and uses many classes from the org.openjdk.jmh library (e.g., InfraControl, ThreadParams, BenchmarkTaskResult, RawResults, Blackhole, Control, BenchmarkParams, IterationParams), indicating high outgoing dependencies. It also interacts with ClassByExtensionBenchmark_jmhType, showing a direct relationship. The class implements multiple benchmark methods (Throughput, AverageTime, SampleTime, SingleShotTime) which increases its interaction surface with the JMH framework, contributing to hub-like characteristics."
