    "justification": "The class BinaryExprMetaModel has a very limited set of dependencies. It extends ExpressionMetaModel and declares three PropertyMetaModel fields. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization. The class is focused on representing metadata for BinaryExpr and does not act as a central hub connecting to many other abstractions."
