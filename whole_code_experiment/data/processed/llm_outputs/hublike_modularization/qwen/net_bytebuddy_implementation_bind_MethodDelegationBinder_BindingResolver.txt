    "justification": "The MethodDelegationBinder interface has extensive dependencies with numerous other abstractions in the codebase. It defines multiple nested interfaces (Record, MethodInvoker, ParameterBinding, MethodBinding, BindingResolver, AmbiguityResolver, TerminationHandler) and classes that are tightly coupled to it. It also depends on various external classes from different packages (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, etc.). Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from other parts of the system that use its functionality for method delegation binding. The interface serves as a central hub coordinating method delegation binding operations, creating a high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
