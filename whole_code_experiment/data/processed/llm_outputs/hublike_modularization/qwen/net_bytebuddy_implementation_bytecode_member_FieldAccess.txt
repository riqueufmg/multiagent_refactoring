    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.FieldAccess",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The FieldAccess enum has extensive dependencies both incoming and outgoing. It interacts with multiple classes like EnumerationDescription, FieldDescription, TypeDefinition, Implementation.Context, StackManipulation, StackSize, TypeCasting, MethodVisitor, Opcodes etc. It also defines several inner classes (OfGenericField, AccessDispatcher, FieldGetInstruction, FieldPutInstruction) which themselves have multiple dependencies. The class serves as a central hub for field access operations within the bytecode implementation, coordinating between various abstraction layers of the Byte Buddy library. This high degree of interconnectedness with both incoming (uses of FieldAccess) and outgoing (FieldAccess's dependencies on other classes) dependencies qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
