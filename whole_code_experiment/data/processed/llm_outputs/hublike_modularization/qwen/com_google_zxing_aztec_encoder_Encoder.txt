        "The Encoder class has outgoing dependencies to multiple classes: BitArray, BitMatrix, GenericGF, ReedSolomonEncoder, HighLevelEncoder, and AztecCode.",
        "It orchestrates the entire Aztec code generation process, coordinating between high-level encoding, error correction, bit manipulation, and matrix rendering.",
        "The class encapsulates complex logic involving multiple abstraction layers (encoding, error correction, bit stuffing, matrix drawing) making it a central hub in the Aztec encoding module.",
        "Its static methods are the primary interface for Aztec code generation, indicating a high number of incoming references.",
        "It directly interacts with at least 6 different classes, showing a high number of outgoing dependencies."
