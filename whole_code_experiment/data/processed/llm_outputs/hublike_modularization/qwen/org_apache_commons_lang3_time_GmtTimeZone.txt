    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.GmtTimeZone",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class GmtTimeZone has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on java.util.Date, java.util.Objects, java.util.TimeZone, and internally uses org.apache.commons.lang3.time.TimeZones.GMT_ID. It does not exhibit a high number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would classify it as hub-like modularization."
