    "justification": "The class 'ClassInjector.UsingInstrumentation' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies on numerous other classes and packages. It imports and interacts with a wide variety of types including com.sun.jna.*, java.lang.instrument.*, net.bytebuddy.*, java.io.*, java.lang.reflect.*, java.net.*, java.security.*, java.util.*, java.util.jar.*, and java.util.zip.*. Furthermore, it utilizes complex internal structures such as nested classes (e.g., Dispatcher, Target, Factory) and interacts with multiple external libraries (like JNA) and system APIs (like Instrumentation, Unsafe). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies across different modules indicates a central, highly-connected role within the application architecture, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
