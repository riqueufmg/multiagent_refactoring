        "The class 'Explicit' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including 'MethodAttributeAppender', 'AnnotationAppender', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' through its usage of annotations and factory patterns.",
        "It also has outgoing dependencies to several classes such as 'Target', 'OnMethod', 'OnMethodParameter', 'Factory', and 'Compound' within the same interface, indicating a high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies.",
        "This extensive interconnectivity suggests that 'Explicit' acts as a hub in the modularization structure, thereby qualifying as an instance of Hub-like Modularization."
