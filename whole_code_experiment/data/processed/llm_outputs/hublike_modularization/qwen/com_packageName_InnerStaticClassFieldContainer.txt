    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency from InnerStaticClassFieldDotExpressions and no outgoing dependencies to other abstractions. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal dependency relationships rather than dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
