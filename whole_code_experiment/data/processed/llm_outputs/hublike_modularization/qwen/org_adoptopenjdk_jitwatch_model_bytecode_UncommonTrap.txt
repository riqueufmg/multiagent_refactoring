    "justification": "The UncommonTrap class has minimal dependencies. It only depends on java.util.Map and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Tag for parsing, and it's only used by BytecodeAnnotationBuilder. It doesn't have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
