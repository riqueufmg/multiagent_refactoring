    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.MultiFormatUPCEANReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": [
        "The class MultiFormatUPCEANReader directly depends on multiple other classes and enums such as BarcodeFormat, DecodeHintType, NotFoundException, Result, BitArray, and UPCEANReader (and its subclasses like EAN13Reader, UPCAReader, EAN8Reader, UPCEReader) through instantiation, method calls, and parameter passing.",
        "It is responsible for coordinating the decoding process across multiple UPC/EAN formats, making it a central point that interacts with various components of the system.",
        "The class aggregates different reader implementations and manages their lifecycle (e.g., calling reset() on each), indicating a high number of outgoing dependencies.",
        "It also handles logic to convert between result types (e.g., EAN-13 to UPC-A), further increasing its coupling with other classes in the system."
