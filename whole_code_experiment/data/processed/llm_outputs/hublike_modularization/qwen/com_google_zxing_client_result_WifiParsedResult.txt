    "justification": "The class WifiParsedResult is a simple data holder (DTO) with no complex logic or numerous dependencies. It has only one outgoing dependency to its superclass ParsedResult and is used by a few other classes such as WifiResultHandler and WifiConfigManager. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies."
