    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.compare.ComparableUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ComparableUtils is a utility class with no dependencies on other classes except for java.util.function.Predicate and org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils. It provides static methods for creating predicates and comparable check builders, but does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization. The class is focused on providing comparison utilities and does not act as a central hub connecting many other abstractions."
