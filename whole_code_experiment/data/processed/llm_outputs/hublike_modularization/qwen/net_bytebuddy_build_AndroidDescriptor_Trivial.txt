    "justification": "The class AndroidDescriptor.Trivial is a simple enum implementation of the AndroidDescriptor interface with minimal dependencies. It only depends on TypeScope (defined within the same file) and TypeDescription (imported from net.bytebuddy.description.type). It has no incoming dependencies from other classes and only provides a basic implementation of the getTypeScope method. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not have numerous incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions."
