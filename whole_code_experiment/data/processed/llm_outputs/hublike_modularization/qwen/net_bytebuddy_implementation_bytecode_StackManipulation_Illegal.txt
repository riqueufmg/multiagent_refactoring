        "The StackManipulation interface defines core types (Size, Illegal, Trivial, Compound, Simple, AbstractBase) that are directly depended upon by numerous other classes in the codebase, creating a central hub of dependencies.",
        "Multiple classes outside the immediate package depend on StackManipulation and its nested types, including Implementation.Context, Implementation.Context.Default, SpecialMethodInvocation, and various ByteCodeAppender implementations.",
        "The StackManipulation interface and its nested classes serve as a central abstraction point for bytecode operations, with both incoming dependencies (consumed by many classes) and outgoing dependencies (depending on MethodVisitor, Implementation.Context, and other core ASM types).",
        "The interface contains multiple nested classes (Illegal, Trivial, Size, Compound, Simple, AbstractBase) that increase its complexity and centrality, making it a hub for stack manipulation related functionality.",
        "The StackManipulation.Size class specifically shows hub-like characteristics by being referenced throughout the codebase for tracking operand stack changes, creating tight coupling with many other components."
