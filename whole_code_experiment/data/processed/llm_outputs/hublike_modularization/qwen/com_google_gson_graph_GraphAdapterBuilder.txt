    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The GraphAdapterBuilder class exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies and central role in the graph serialization/deserialization mechanism. It directly depends on multiple core Gson classes including Gson, GsonBuilder, TypeAdapter, TypeAdapterFactory, InstanceCreator, JsonElement, and various stream classes. It also interacts with internal Gson classes like ConstructorConstructor and ObjectConstructor. The class serves as a central hub that coordinates graph-aware serialization by managing instance creators, type adapters, and the serialization/deserialization process through its nested Factory class. This creates a high degree of incoming and outgoing dependencies, making it a central point of coupling between different parts of the Gson library's type adaptation system."
