    "justification": "The class Code128Writer does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It has a well-defined responsibility of encoding CODE128 barcodes and interacts primarily with a few closely related classes such as Code128Reader for pattern data, OneDimensionalCodeWriter for common functionality, and standard Java utilities. The dependencies are focused and aligned with its specific purpose, without excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like behavior."
