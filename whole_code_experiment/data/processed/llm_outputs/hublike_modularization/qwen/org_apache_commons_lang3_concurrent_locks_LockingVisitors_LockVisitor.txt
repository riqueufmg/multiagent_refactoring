    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks.LockingVisitors",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class LockingVisitors is not hub-like because it has a clear and focused responsibility of providing locking visitor patterns for different lock types. It does not have excessive dependencies with other abstractions. The class mainly interacts with standard Java concurrency utilities (Lock, ReadWriteLock, ReentrantLock, StampedLock) and internal functional interfaces. The relationships are well-contained within its own module and do not exhibit the characteristics of a hub with numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies."
