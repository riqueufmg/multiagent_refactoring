    "justification": "The TypeParameterMetaModel class has very few dependencies. It extends ReferenceTypeMetaModel and declares two public PropertyMetaModel fields. The class itself is minimal, serving only as a metadata holder for TypeParameter. It does not exhibit hub-like characteristics as it has limited incoming and outgoing dependencies compared to other meta-model classes in the codebase."
