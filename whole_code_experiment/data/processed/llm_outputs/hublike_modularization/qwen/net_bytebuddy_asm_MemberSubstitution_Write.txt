    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Write",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class is MemberSubstitution, not MemberSubstitution.Write. The MemberSubstitution class is large and complex, but it follows a modular design pattern with nested classes and interfaces that each have specific responsibilities. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has a clear hierarchical structure with well-defined interfaces and responsibilities distributed across multiple nested classes and interfaces."
