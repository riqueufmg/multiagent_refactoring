    "justification": "AstObserver is an interface with minimal dependencies. It defines observer callbacks for AST changes and has only a few direct dependencies: Node, NodeList, and ObservableProperty. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not depend on or被依赖 by a large number of other abstractions."
