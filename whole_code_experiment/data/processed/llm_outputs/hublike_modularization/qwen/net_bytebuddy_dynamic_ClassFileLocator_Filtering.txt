        "The ClassFileLocator interface defines a core abstraction with numerous implementations, each handling different sources of class files (e.g., ForClassLoader, ForJarFile, ForModule, ForFolder, ForUrl, ForInstrumentation).",
        "It has both incoming dependencies (used by other classes like HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and outgoing dependencies (depends on various Java I/O, reflection, and ByteBuddy utility classes).",
        "The interface and its implementations are central to the ByteBuddy library's functionality for locating and loading class files, making it a hub for class loading and transformation operations.",
        "Multiple other classes depend on ClassFileLocator for their functionality, and it in turn depends on a wide range of other abstractions (e.g., JavaModule, ClassFileVersion, StreamDrainer, etc.)."
