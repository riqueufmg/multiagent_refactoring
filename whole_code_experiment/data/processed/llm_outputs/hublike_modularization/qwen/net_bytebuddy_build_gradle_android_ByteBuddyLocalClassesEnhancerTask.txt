    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask has dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. It interacts with multiple classes from different packages such as com.android.build.gradle, net.bytebuddy, org.gradle.api, and java.util, indicating a high number of dependencies. This class serves as a central point for instrumentation tasks in the Android build process, coordinating between various components like Plugin, ClassFileLocator, AndroidDescriptor, and Gradle's task system, thus acting as a hub."
