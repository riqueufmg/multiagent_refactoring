    "justification": "The class FailableIntUnaryOperator is a functional interface with a single abstract method 'applyAsInt' and a few default/static methods for composition and utility purposes. It does not exhibit a large number of dependencies either incoming or outgoing. It only interacts with similar functional interfaces and basic Java types, and does not act as a hub connecting numerous other abstractions."
