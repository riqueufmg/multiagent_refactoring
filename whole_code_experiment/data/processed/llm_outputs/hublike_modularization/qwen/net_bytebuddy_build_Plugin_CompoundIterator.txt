    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.CompoundIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class is Plugin.CompoundIterator which is a simple iterator implementation that combines multiple iterables. It has minimal dependencies - it only depends on java.util.Iterator, java.util.Queue, java.util.NoSuchElementException, and net.bytebuddy.utility.QueueFactory. It does not have many incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
