    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JavaParserJsonSerializer has a focused responsibility of serializing AST nodes to JSON. It primarily interacts with a limited set of classes: Node, NodeList, JsonGenerator, JavaParserMetaModel, BaseNodeMetaModel, PropertyMetaModel, Range, TokenRange, and JavaToken. While it uses JavaParserMetaModel to get node metadata, this is a necessary dependency for its operation and not indicative of hub-like behavior. The class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would suggest it is a central hub in the system architecture."
