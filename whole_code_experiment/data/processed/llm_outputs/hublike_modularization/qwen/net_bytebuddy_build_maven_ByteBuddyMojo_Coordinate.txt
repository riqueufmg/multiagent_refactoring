    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ByteBuddyMojo has a large number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with other abstractions. It directly depends on numerous classes from different packages such as org.apache.maven, org.eclipse.aether, net.bytebuddy, and others. Additionally, it contains multiple nested classes (ForLifecycleTypes, ForExplicitLocations, ForDependencyFolder, etc.) that extend or are tightly coupled with the main class, increasing its complexity and dependency footprint. The class also manages various Maven lifecycle phases and interacts with multiple Maven components like RepositorySystem, MavenProject, MojoExecution, etc., making it a central hub for dependencies within the module."
