    "justification": "The class VoidVisitorAdapterGenerator has a limited number of dependencies. It extends VisitorGenerator and interacts with a few classes like SourceRoot, BaseNodeMetaModel, PropertyMetaModel, and JavaParser AST classes such as CompilationUnit, MethodDeclaration, and BlockStmt. These dependencies are focused on its specific role of generating visitor methods, and it does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
