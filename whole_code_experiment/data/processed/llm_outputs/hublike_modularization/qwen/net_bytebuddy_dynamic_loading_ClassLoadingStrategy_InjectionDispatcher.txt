    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy.InjectionDispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The InjectionDispatcher class exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies and central role in class loading strategies. It directly interacts with multiple core classes including ClassInjector.UsingReflection, PackageDefinitionStrategy, and ProtectionDomain, while also being referenced by the Default enum which serves as a central configuration point. The class acts as a hub that coordinates between different class loading mechanisms (reflection, unsafe, JNA) and package definition strategies, creating a high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies that centralize around this abstraction."
