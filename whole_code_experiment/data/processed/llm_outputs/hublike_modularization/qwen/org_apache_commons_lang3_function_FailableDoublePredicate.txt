    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FailableDoublePredicate is a functional interface that defines a single abstract method 'test' and several default/static methods for logical operations (and, negate, or) and constants (TRUE, FALSE). It does not have a large number of dependencies either incoming or outgoing. It only depends on java.util.Objects and java.util.function.DoublePredicate, and it is not depended upon by a large number of other abstractions. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
