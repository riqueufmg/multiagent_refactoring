    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedArrayType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ResolvedArrayType has a limited number of dependencies. It primarily depends on ResolvedType and ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration for its core functionality. While it is used by several classes like TypeExtractor, JavaParserParameterDeclaration, ArrayType, LazyType, and MethodResolutionLogic, the dependencies are not excessive. The class itself only directly interacts with a small set of abstractions, and the incoming dependencies are mainly from specific areas of the codebase dealing with type resolution and AST node type extraction. This usage pattern does not constitute a hub-like dependency structure."
