    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class Failable has numerous dependencies with other classes in the package org.apache.commons.lang3.function. It interacts with multiple functional interfaces like FailableBiConsumer, FailableConsumer, FailableFunction, FailablePredicate, FailableBiFunction, FailableBiPredicate, FailableCallable, FailableRunnable, FailableSupplier, and their variants (FailableDoubleConsumer, FailableIntConsumer, etc.). Additionally, it provides utility methods that convert between failable and standard Java functional interfaces, indicating a central role in the module. This high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies classifies it as Hub-like Modularization."
