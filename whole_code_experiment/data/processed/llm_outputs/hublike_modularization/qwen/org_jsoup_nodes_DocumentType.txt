    "justification": "The DocumentType class has a limited number of dependencies. It primarily interacts with core utilities like Validate, StringUtil, and QuietAppendable for basic operations such as validation, string manipulation, and output handling. It does not exhibit a high number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would classify it as hub-like modularization."
