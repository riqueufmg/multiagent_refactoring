    "justification": "The class VMLanguageConfigStage has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on JITWatchConfig for configuration management, IStageClosedListener for stage closing notifications, and UserInterfaceUtil for UI utilities. These are all direct and necessary dependencies for its functionality as a configuration stage. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
