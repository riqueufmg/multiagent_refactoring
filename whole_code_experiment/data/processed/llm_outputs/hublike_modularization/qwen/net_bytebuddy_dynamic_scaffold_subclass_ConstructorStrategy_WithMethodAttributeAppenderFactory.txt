    "detection": false,
    "justification": "This class has a very limited set of dependencies. It depends on ConstructorStrategy.Default (inner class), MethodAttributeAppender.Factory, and basic Java types (List, ArrayList, Collections). It does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies. The class is a simple wrapper that delegates to a delegate ConstructorStrategy and applies a MethodAttributeAppender.Factory. It does not act as a hub connecting to many other abstractions."
