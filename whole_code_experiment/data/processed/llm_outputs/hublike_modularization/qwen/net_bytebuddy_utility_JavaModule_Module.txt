    "justification": "The class JavaModule acts as a hub by managing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions. It directly interacts with multiple classes and interfaces such as JavaDispatcher, Resolver, Module, AnnotatedElement, ClassFileVersion, and others through static and instance methods. It also serves as a central point for module-related operations, handling incoming and outgoing dependencies for module representation, annotation processing, and resource management. The class encapsulates complex interactions with the Java module system and delegates responsibilities through various utility and description classes, making it a central hub in the modularization structure."
