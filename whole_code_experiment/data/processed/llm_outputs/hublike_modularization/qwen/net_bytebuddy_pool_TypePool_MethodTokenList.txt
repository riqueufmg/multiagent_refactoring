    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class TypePool.MethodTokenList is a protected inner class within TypePool.Default.LazyTypeDescription. It only has dependencies on MethodDescription and related classes within the same package and parent classes. It does not have a large number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with many other abstractions. The class has a very focused responsibility - representing a list of method tokens - and maintains low coupling with a limited set of related types."
