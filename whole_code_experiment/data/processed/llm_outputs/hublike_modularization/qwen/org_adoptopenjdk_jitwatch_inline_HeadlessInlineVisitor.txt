    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class HeadlessInlineVisitor has incoming dependencies from LaunchHeadless and outgoing dependencies to multiple classes including IMetaMember, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, CompilationUtil, Tag, IParseDictionary, ParseUtil, and inner classes like InlineJournalVisitor and InlineFailureInfo. It acts as a central point for inlining failure analysis, coordinating between various components of the JIT watch system, which indicates hub-like modularization."
