    "justification": "The Safelist class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It is a self-contained class that encapsulates the logic for defining HTML cleaning rules. Its dependencies are limited to core Java utilities (HashMap, HashSet, etc.) and internal jsoup classes (Validate, Normalizer, Attribute, Attributes, Element). It does not have extensive incoming or outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions. The class is focused on a single responsibility of managing safe HTML elements and attributes, and its interactions are primarily internal or with closely related components within the same package."
