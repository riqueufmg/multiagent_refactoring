    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The MultiFormatWriter class acts as a central hub by directly depending on and coordinating with numerous Writer implementations (EAN8Writer, UPCEWriter, EAN13Writer, UPCAWriter, QRCodeWriter, Code39Writer, Code93Writer, Code128Writer, ITFWriter, PDF417Writer, CodaBarWriter, DataMatrixWriter, AztecWriter). It also depends on BarcodeFormat to determine which writer to instantiate and uses WriterException for error handling. This creates a high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
