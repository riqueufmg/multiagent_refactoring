    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ModifierOrderer.ModifierTokens",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ModifierTokens is a nested static class within ModifierOrderer and is used exclusively within that class. It does not have dependencies on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it depend on many other classes itself. Its functionality is focused and limited to handling modifier tokens for reordering, and it interacts primarily with its enclosing class and a few closely related types such as Modifier, Token, and ImmutableList. Therefore, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
