    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Detector class has a focused responsibility of detecting PDF417 barcodes in images. While it interacts with several classes like BinaryBitmap, BitMatrix, ResultPoint, and PDF417DetectorResult, these dependencies are necessary for its core function and are not excessive. The class does not show hub-like behavior as it doesn't have an unusually high number of incoming or outgoing dependencies beyond what's required for PDF417 detection. It primarily depends on standard ZXing framework classes and returns results in appropriate data structures."
