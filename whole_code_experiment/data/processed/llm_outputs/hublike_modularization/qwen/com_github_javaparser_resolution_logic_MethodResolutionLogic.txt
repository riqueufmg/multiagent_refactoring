    "justification": "The class MethodResolutionLogic has extensive dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It interacts with many classes from different packages such as com.github.javaparser.resolution.types (ResolvedType, ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedArrayType, etc.), com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations (ResolvedMethodDeclaration, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, etc.), com.github.javaparser.resolution.model (SymbolReference, LambdaArgumentTypePlaceholder), and com.github.javaparser.resolution (TypeSolver, MethodUsage). It also uses classes from com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts and other packages. The class contains numerous methods that are central to method resolution logic, requiring deep integration with various type systems, declarations, and contexts, making it a hub-like component with high incoming and outgoing dependencies."
