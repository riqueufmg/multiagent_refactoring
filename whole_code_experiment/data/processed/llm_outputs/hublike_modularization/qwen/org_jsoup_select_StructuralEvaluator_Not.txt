        "The class 'StructuralEvaluator' is an abstract base class with multiple nested static classes (Root, Has, Is, Not, Ancestor, ImmediateParentRun, PreviousSibling, ImmediatePreviousSibling), each representing different evaluation strategies.",
        "It defines a common structure and shared functionality (e.g., memoization via threadMemo, evaluator field) used by all its subclasses.",
        "Each nested class interacts closely with the outer class's fields and methods such as evaluator, memoMatches(), wantsNodes, and reset().",
        "This creates a hub where many components depend on the central StructuralEvaluator for shared state and behavior, leading to high coupling and potential difficulty in modifying or extending individual parts without affecting others."
