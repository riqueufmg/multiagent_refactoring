    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MinimalEncoder, while complex and containing multiple nested classes (Edge, Result, Input), does not exhibit hub-like modularization. It has a single, well-defined responsibility of encoding DataMatrix barcodes using a minimal encoding algorithm. The nested classes are tightly related to the encoding process and are used internally. There are no excessive dependencies on other classes or modules outside of its own package. The class does not act as a central hub connecting to many other unrelated abstractions. Instead, it encapsulates the encoding logic within itself and its inner classes, maintaining a cohesive and focused design."
