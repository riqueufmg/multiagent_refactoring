    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.CollectionTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CollectionTypeAdapterFactory has a focused responsibility of creating TypeAdapters for Collection types. It depends on a limited set of classes: ConstructorConstructor, Gson, TypeToken, GsonTypes, TypeAdapter, ObjectConstructor, JsonReader, JsonWriter, and JsonToken. These dependencies are all directly related to its core functionality of handling JSON serialization/deserialization for collections. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it doesn't have excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies beyond what is necessary for its specific purpose."
