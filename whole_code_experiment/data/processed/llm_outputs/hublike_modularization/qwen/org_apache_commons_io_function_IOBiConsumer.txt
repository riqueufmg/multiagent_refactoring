    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IOBiConsumer has minimal dependencies: it depends on Constants (for noop implementation) and Uncheck (for asBiConsumer method). It does not act as a hub connecting to numerous other classes or interfaces. The interface itself is simple and focused, with most logic residing in default methods that connect to only a few utility classes. This is not indicative of Hub-like Modularization."
