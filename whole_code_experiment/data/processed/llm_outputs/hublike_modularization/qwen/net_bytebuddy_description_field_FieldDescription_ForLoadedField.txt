    "justification": "The class FieldDescription.ForLoadedField has a limited number of dependencies. It primarily depends on java.lang.reflect.Field and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription for its core functionality. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions, which would be characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. The class serves a specific purpose of describing loaded fields and does not act as a central hub connecting to numerous other modules or abstractions."
