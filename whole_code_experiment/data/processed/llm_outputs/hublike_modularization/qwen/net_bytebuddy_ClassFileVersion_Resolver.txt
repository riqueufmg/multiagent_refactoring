    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The ClassFileVersion class does not exhibit hub-like modularization. It has a well-defined responsibility of representing and managing Java class file versions. Its dependencies are limited and focused: it interacts with core Java classes (e.g., System, Runtime, ClassLoader), ASM library (Opcodes), and ByteBuddy's own classes (TypeDescription, ClassFileLocator). It does not act as a central hub connecting to a large number of unrelated abstractions. The class is cohesive, with all methods and fields serving the single purpose of class file version management."
