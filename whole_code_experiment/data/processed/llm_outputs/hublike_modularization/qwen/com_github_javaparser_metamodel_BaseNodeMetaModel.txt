    "justification": "The class BaseNodeMetaModel has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It interacts with classes such as Node, PropertyMetaModel, JavaParserMetaModel, NodeList, and various utility classes like Utils. It is used in multiple generators and visitors, indicating both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This central role in managing metadata for AST nodes and its extensive use across different parts of the system indicate hub-like modularization."
