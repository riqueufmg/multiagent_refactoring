    "justification": "The class ByteBuddyTransformationConfiguration has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on core types such as Project, Configuration, Provider, FileCollection, and ByteBuddyInstrumentationParameters, which are necessary for its function of configuring Byte Buddy instrumentation parameters. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
