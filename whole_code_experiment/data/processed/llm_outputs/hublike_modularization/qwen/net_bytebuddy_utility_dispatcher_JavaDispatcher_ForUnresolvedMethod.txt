    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JavaDispatcher.ForUnresolvedMethod has a single responsibility: to handle unresolved method dispatches by throwing an exception or generating appropriate bytecode. It does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization as it has minimal dependencies, both incoming and outgoing. It depends on core Java classes (IllegalStateException, MethodVisitor, Type) and ASM library classes, which are essential for its function. It is used by the JavaDispatcher class, but this usage is part of a well-defined delegation structure, not creating a hub. The class is focused and does not act as a central point connecting a large number of other abstractions."
