        "The class Evaluator is an abstract base class that defines a large number of static nested classes, each representing a specific type of CSS selector evaluation logic.",
        "These nested classes include Tag, Id, Class, Attribute, AttributeWithValue, AttributeWithValueNot, AttributeWithValueStarting, AttributeWithValueEnding, AttributeWithValueContaining, AttributeWithValueMatching, AllElements, IndexLessThan, IndexGreaterThan, IndexEquals, IsLastChild, IsFirstOfType, IsLastOfType, CssNthEvaluator, IsNthChild, IsNthLastChild, IsNthOfType, IsNthLastOfType, IsFirstChild, IsRoot, IsOnlyChild, IsOnlyOfType, IsEmpty, ContainsText, ContainsWholeText, ContainsWholeOwnText, ContainsData, ContainsOwnText, Matches, MatchesOwn, MatchesWholeText, MatchesWholeOwnText, and MatchText.",
        "Each of these nested classes extends Evaluator and implements specific matching logic, indicating that Evaluator serves as a central hub for various evaluation strategies.",
        "The class also defines multiple abstract and concrete methods (matches, asPredicate, cost, reset) that are utilized by its numerous subclasses, further establishing it as a central point of dependency.",
        "The extensive use of nested classes that all depend on the outer Evaluator class for their definition and functionality indicates a hub-like modularization smell, where Evaluator acts as a central point with many incoming dependencies from its nested classes and outgoing dependencies to the broader codebase through its API."
