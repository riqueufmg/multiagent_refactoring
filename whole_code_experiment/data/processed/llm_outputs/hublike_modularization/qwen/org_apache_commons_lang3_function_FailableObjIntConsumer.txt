    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FailableObjIntConsumer is a simple functional interface with minimal dependencies. It only references java.util.function.ObjIntConsumer from the Java standard library and does not have numerous incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions within the codebase. It serves a single focused purpose of representing a failable consumer operation and includes only basic elements: a NOP singleton, a static factory method for the NOP, and the abstract accept method. There are no complex interconnections or hub-like dependency patterns present."
