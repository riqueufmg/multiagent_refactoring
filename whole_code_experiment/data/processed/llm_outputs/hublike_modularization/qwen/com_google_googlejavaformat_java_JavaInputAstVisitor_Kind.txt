    "justification": "The class JavaInputAstVisitor has a large number of dependencies due to its extensive use of various classes from the com.sun.source.tree package for visiting different types of AST nodes. It also depends on multiple classes from com.google.common.collect, com.google.googlejavaformat, and other utility classes. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies as it is designed to be used by other parts of the formatting system, making it a central hub for AST processing and formatting operations."
