    "justification": "The class EventUtils has a limited number of dependencies. It primarily interacts with java.lang.reflect classes (InvocationHandler, Method, Proxy) and org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.MethodUtils. The inner class EventBindingInvocationHandler also has a localized scope of dependencies. There are no excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
