    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Decoder class has a moderate number of dependencies, primarily with classes within the same package (BitMatrixParser, DataBlock, DecodedBitStreamParser, Version) and with common utility classes (BitMatrix, DecoderResult). It also depends on ReedSolomonDecoder for error correction. However, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have an excessive number of incoming or outgoing dependencies across multiple packages or modules. Its role is well-defined and encapsulated within the Data Matrix decoding process."
