{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Uncheck' has incoming dependencies from multiple functional interface classes (e.g., IOBiConsumer, IOConsumer, IOFunction, etc.) and outgoing dependencies to various utility and exception classes (e.g., IOException, UncheckedIOException). It acts as a central hub for converting checked IO exceptions to unchecked exceptions, providing static methods used across numerous other classes in the package. This high number of both incoming and outgoing connections qualifies it as hub-like modularization."
