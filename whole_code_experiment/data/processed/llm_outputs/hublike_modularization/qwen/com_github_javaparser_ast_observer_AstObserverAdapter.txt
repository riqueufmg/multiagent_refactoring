    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The AstObserverAdapter class has minimal dependencies. It implements the AstObserver interface and interacts with Node and NodeList classes, but it does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies. The class serves as a simple adapter with default empty implementations for observer methods, and does not act as a hub connecting to numerous other abstractions."
