    "justification": "The class TooltipUtil has only one method 'buildInlineAnnotationText' which is used by two other classes (BytecodeAnnotationBuilder and CompileChainWalker) in the same package. It does not have a large number of dependencies either incoming or outgoing. It only depends on ParseUtil and StringUtil from the same package and IParseDictionary from the model package. This limited number of dependencies does not qualify as 'hub-like modularization'."
