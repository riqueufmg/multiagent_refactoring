    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The TypeWriter interface and its nested classes exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It has extensive dependencies both incoming and outgoing: it depends on numerous other abstractions within the Byte Buddy library (e.g., TypeDescription, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, ClassVisitor, MethodVisitor, FieldVisitor, RecordComponentVisitor, AnnotationVisitor, etc.), and many other parts of the library depend on it. It serves as a central hub for type creation and manipulation, coordinating interactions between various components like MethodPool, FieldPool, RecordComponentPool, Implementation.Context, TypeInitializer, and ASM visitors. Its Default implementation and subclasses (ForCreation, ForInlining, etc.) further increase its connectivity by integrating with almost all major concepts of the library's type creation and modification process, making it a highly connected module with high fan-in and fan-out."
