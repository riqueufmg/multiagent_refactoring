    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FileFactory has a focused responsibility of creating files and copying files. It has a limited number of dependencies, mainly to classes like Directory, RegularFile, SymbolicLink, HeapDisk, FileTimeSource, and JimfsPath. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization. The use of Supplier interfaces and inner classes for creation callbacks is a design choice that encapsulates creation logic without creating excessive dependencies."
