    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class TypeProxy has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It directly depends on many classes and interfaces such as ByteBuddy, ClassFileVersion, TypeDescription, Implementation, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, StackManipulation, DynamicType, InstrumentedType, MethodAccessorFactory, ByteCodeAppender, and various ASM classes. Additionally, it defines several inner classes (AbstractMethodErrorThrow, SilentConstruction, ForSuperMethodByConstructor, ForSuperMethodByReflectionFactory, ForDefaultMethod, MethodCall) and interfaces (InvocationFactory) that further increase its dependency footprint. The class also interacts with reflection APIs and has complex relationships with the implementation framework through its use of special method invocations, method accessors, and auxiliary type creation. This extensive web of incoming and outgoing dependencies classifies it as hub-like modularization."
