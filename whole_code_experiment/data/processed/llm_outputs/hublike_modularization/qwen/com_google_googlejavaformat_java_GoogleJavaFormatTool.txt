    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal dependencies - it implements javax.tools.Tool interface and uses basic Java I/O classes (InputStream, OutputStream, PrintStream) and some Google Guava utilities (Sets.toImmutableEnumSet). It does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions. The class is focused on a single responsibility of providing a tool interface for google-java-format."
