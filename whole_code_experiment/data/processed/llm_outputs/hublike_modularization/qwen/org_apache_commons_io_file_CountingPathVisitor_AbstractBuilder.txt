    "justification": "The AbstractBuilder class has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on classes and interfaces within the same package such as PathCounters, PathFilter, UnaryOperator, and SimplePathVisitor.AbstractBuilder. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization. Its role is clearly defined as a builder for CountingPathVisitor, encapsulating configuration concerns without acting as a central hub for diverse functionalities."
