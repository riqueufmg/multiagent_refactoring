        "The class 'LongStringsAndTextBlockScanner' is a nested class within 'StringWrapper' and is responsible for scanning AST nodes to identify long string literals and text blocks. It directly interacts with multiple external classes and utilities such as 'TreePathScanner', 'LiteralTree', 'MemberSelectTree', 'Trees', 'Newlines', 'JCTree', 'Position.LineMap', 'CharMatcher', and 'ImmutableList'.",
        "It has incoming dependencies from its enclosing class 'StringWrapper' which relies on it to perform AST scanning as part of the string wrapping logic.",
        "It has outgoing dependencies to various Java compiler API classes (e.g., 'com.sun.source.tree.*', 'com.sun.tools.javac.*') and Google Guava utilities (e.g., 'ImmutableList', 'CharMatcher').",
        "The class is tightly coupled with the internal logic of 'StringWrapper' and acts as a central point for identifying and processing string-related AST nodes, making it a hub for both internal and external dependencies."
