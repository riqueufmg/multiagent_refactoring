    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class RemoveUnusedImports has high cohesion but also exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies on various external libraries and JDK classes. It directly interacts with numerous types from com.sun.source.*, com.sun.tools.javac.*, com.google.common.collect, and other utility classes like java.lang.reflect.Method. The class integrates multiple responsibilities including AST traversal, javadoc parsing, import analysis, and source code manipulation, leading to a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies which makes it a hub in the module dependency graph."
