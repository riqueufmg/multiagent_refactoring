    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_benchmarkJdkProxy_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing. It imports and uses many classes from the org.openjdk.jmh library (e.g., BenchmarkTaskResult, InfraControl, Blackhole, etc.), several Java util and concurrent classes (e.g., List, AtomicInteger, ArrayList), and also depends on ClassByImplementationBenchmark_jmhType. Additionally, it contains multiple methods that are tightly coupled with these dependencies, indicating hub-like modularization."
