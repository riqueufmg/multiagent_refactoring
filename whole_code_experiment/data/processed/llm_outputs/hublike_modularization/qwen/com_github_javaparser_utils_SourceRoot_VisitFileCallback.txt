    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The SourceRoot class exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies and interactions with numerous other classes and components. It directly interacts with core JavaParser components like JavaParser, ParseResult, CompilationUnit, and ParserConfiguration for parsing functionalities. It also integrates with file system APIs (Path, Files, SimpleFileVisitor, ForkJoinPool) for file handling and parallel processing. Additionally, it uses utility classes like DefaultPrettyPrinter, ConcurrentHashMap, and Log for various operations. The class manages a cache of parsed files, handles file saving with encoding support, and supports both sequential and parallelized parsing, making it a central hub connecting to many different modules and abstractions within the system."
