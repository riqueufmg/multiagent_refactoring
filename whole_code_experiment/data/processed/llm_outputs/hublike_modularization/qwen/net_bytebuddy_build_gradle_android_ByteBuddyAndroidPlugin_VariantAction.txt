    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies and interactions with numerous other abstractions. It directly imports and utilizes a wide range of classes from the Android Gradle Plugin API (e.g., AndroidComponentsExtension, Variant, Artifacts, InstrumentationScope), Gradle's core API (e.g., Project, Configuration, TaskProvider, Attribute), and ByteBuddy's API (e.g., ByteBuddyAndroidService, Plugin). Furthermore, it defines multiple inner classes (VariantAction, RuntimeClassPathResolver, ByteBuddyTransformationConfiguration, etc.) that also interact with many external types, centralizing complex logic and creating a hub of dependencies. This central role and high number of incoming and outgoing connections confirm the presence of the Hub-like Modularization smell."
