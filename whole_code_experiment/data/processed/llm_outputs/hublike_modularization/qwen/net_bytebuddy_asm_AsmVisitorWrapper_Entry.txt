    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class AsmVisitorWrapper.Entry has limited dependencies. It implements ElementMatcher and FieldVisitorWrapper, uses ElementMatcher for matching fields, and interacts with FieldDescription and FieldVisitor. It does not show a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization. The class is focused on its specific responsibility of wrapping field visitors based on matching criteria."
