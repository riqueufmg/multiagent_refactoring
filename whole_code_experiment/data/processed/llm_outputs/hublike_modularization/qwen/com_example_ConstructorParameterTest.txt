    "justification": "The class ConstructorParameterTest has minimal dependencies. It uses @NotNull and @Nullable annotations from com.github.javaparser.quality but does not directly depend on the Preconditions class or any other complex dependencies. The class is simple, with a single constructor and no outgoing dependencies beyond the annotations. There are also no incoming dependencies shown that would indicate hub-like behavior."
