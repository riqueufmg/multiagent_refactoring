    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Handler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Handler has limited dependencies and responsibilities. It extends URLStreamHandler and interacts primarily with core Java classes (URL, URLConnection, InetAddress) and one internal class (PathURLConnection). It does not show a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions in the codebase, which would be indicative of Hub-like Modularization. Its role is well-defined and constrained to handling jimfs protocol URLs."
