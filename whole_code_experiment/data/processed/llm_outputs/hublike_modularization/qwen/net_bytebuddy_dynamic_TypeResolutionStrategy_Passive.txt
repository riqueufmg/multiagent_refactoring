    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The TypeResolutionStrategy interface acts as a hub with multiple implementations (Passive, Active, Lazy, Disabled) and its nested Resolved interface, creating numerous dependencies. It connects to various other abstractions like DynamicType, ClassLoadingStrategy, LoadedTypeInitializer, TypeInitializer, NexusAccessor, and Map implementations. The interface and its implementations have both incoming dependencies (being used by other classes) and outgoing dependencies (using multiple other classes and interfaces), making it a central point that many other abstractions depend on and that depends on many other abstractions."
