    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal dependencies, only importing java.io.File, java.util.Arrays, java.util.Comparator, and java.util.List. It serves as a simple abstract base class for file comparators with no outgoing dependencies to other abstractions in the codebase. The class does not act as a hub connecting to numerous other classes or modules."
