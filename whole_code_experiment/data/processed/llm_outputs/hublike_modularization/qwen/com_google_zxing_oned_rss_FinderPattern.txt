    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.FinderPattern",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FinderPattern has limited dependencies: it depends on com.google.zxing.ResultPoint and is used by RSS14Reader, Pair, RSSExpandedReader, and ExpandedPair. While it is used in multiple classes, the number of dependencies is not excessive and does not indicate hub-like modularization. It serves as a simple data carrier with minimal logic, encapsulating finder pattern data."
