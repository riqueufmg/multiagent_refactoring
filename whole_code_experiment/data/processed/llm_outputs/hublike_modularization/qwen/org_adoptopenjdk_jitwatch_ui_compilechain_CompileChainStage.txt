    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain.CompileChainStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class CompileChainStage has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It directly interacts with classes like CompileChainWalker, CompileNode, JITWatchUI, RateLimitedResizeListener, and CompilationChooser. Additionally, it implements multiple interfaces (ICompilationChangeListener, IRedrawable) and uses various JavaFX components and event handlers, indicating a high degree of incoming and outgoing dependencies which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
