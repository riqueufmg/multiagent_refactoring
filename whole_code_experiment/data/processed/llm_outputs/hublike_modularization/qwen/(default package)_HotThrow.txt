    "justification": "The class HotThrow has minimal dependencies - it only imports java.util.Random and uses standard Java classes (StringBuilder, String, char[], System.out). It does not have incoming dependencies from other classes nor does it depend on a large number of other abstractions. The class is self-contained with simple utility methods and does not act as a hub connecting multiple modules or components."
