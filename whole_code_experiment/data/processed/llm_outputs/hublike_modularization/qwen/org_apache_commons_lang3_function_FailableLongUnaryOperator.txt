    "justification": "The class FailableLongUnaryOperator is a functional interface with minimal dependencies. It declares a single method applyAsLong and provides default methods for composition (andThen, compose) and static factory methods (identity, nop). It depends on java.util.Objects and java.util.function.LongUnaryOperator from the standard library, and is designed to be used as a functional interface, not as a hub coordinating multiple modules or abstractions."
