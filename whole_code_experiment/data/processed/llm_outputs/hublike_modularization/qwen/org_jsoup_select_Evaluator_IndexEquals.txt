        "The class Evaluator is an abstract base class that defines a large number of static nested classes, each representing a specific type of CSS selector evaluation logic.",
        "These nested classes cover various aspects of CSS selection including tag names, attributes, pseudo-classes, text matching, and more, indicating a high degree of responsibility and complexity within the class.",
        "The Evaluator class has dependencies on multiple other classes from different packages such as org.jsoup.nodes, org.jsoup.helper, org.jsoup.parser, and org.jsoup.internal, increasing its incoming and outgoing dependency count.",
        "It imports and utilizes various node types (Element, TextNode, Comment, etc.), regex utilities, and string normalization tools, showing extensive interaction with other abstractions.",
        "The presence of numerous inner classes that extend Evaluator and override its methods indicates that Evaluator serves as a central hub for diverse evaluation strategies, making it a hub-like modularization."
