    "detection": false,
    "justification": "This class has minimal dependencies and is a simple extension of SymbolInfo. It only overrides three methods and has no outgoing dependencies to other classes. The class serves a single focused purpose as a data holder for DataMatrix symbol information with fixed values, and does not act as a hub connecting multiple abstractions."
