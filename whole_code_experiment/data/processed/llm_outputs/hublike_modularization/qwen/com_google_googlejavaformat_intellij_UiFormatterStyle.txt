    "justification": "UiFormatterStyle is a simple enum with minimal dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to JavaFormatterOptions.Style for conversion purposes, but the relationship is straightforward and not extensive. It does not act as a hub connecting numerous other abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies. The class serves a specific and limited role in mapping UI style options to formatter options."
