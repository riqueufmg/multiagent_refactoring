    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.MessageDigestCalculatingInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Builder class has a limited and well-defined set of dependencies. It primarily interacts with MessageDigestCalculatingInputStream, MessageDigest, and Observer classes. It does not exhibit a large number of dependencies (either incoming or outgoing) with other abstractions, which would be characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. The class serves a specific purpose within the builder pattern and encapsulates the construction logic without becoming a hub for numerous unrelated dependencies."
