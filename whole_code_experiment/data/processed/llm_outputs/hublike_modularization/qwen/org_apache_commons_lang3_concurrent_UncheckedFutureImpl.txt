    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.UncheckedFutureImpl",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class UncheckedFutureImpl has a limited number of dependencies. It extends AbstractFutureProxy and implements UncheckedFuture, and it uses standard Java concurrent classes like Future, ExecutionException, InterruptedException, TimeoutException, and TimeUnit. It also uses UncheckedInterruptedException, UncheckedExecutionException, and UncheckedTimeoutException from the same package. The class does not show a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions, thus it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
