    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class UncheckedFilterReader does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It has a limited number of dependencies, primarily relying on java.io classes and the Uncheck utility class from the same library (org.apache.commons.io.function). It does not act as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions. Its role is specific: wrapping a FilterReader to convert checked IOExceptions into UncheckedIOExceptions. The dependencies are focused and aligned with its purpose."
