    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The TypeWriter interface and its nested classes exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It has numerous dependencies both incoming (from many classes in the net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold package and related packages like implementation, description, etc.) and outgoing (to a large number of classes across different packages like asm, utility, pool, etc.). The class itself defines multiple nested interfaces (FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool) and classes (Default and its nested classes like ForInlining, ForCreation, etc.), each interacting with various other parts of the system. This central role in managing type creation and manipulation, along with its extensive use of other abstractions (ASM visitors, ByteBuddy descriptions, implementation contexts, etc.) and being used by many other classes, confirms it as a hub with high fan-in and fan-out."
