    "class": "main.GrandParent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class GrandParent has minimal dependencies - it only contains a public enum MyEnum with two values. There are no incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it doesn't serve as a central point of communication between multiple other classes or modules."
