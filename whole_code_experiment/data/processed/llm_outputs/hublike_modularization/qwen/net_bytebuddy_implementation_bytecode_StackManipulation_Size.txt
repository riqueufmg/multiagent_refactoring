    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Size is a simple data class that holds two integer values (sizeImpact and maximalSize) and provides methods to access and aggregate them. It does not have dependencies on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it depend on many other classes. It is used within the same package and has limited outgoing and incoming dependencies, thus it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
