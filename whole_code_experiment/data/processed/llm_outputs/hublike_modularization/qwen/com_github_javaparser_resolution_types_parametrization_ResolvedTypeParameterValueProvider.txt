    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The ResolvedTypeParameterValueProvider interface has a limited number of dependencies. It interacts primarily with ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration and ResolvedType, and uses ResolvedWildcard in one method. This is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as it does not show excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies to a large number of abstractions."
