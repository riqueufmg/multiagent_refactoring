    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.other.BndGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The BndGenerator class has a limited number of dependencies. It directly depends on classes from only a few packages: com.github.javaparser.generator (superclass Generator), com.github.javaparser.utils (Log, SourceRoot), and standard Java packages (java.io, java.nio, java.util). This is not indicative of hub-like modularization, which would involve dependencies on a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing. The class serves a specific purpose (generating bnd.bnd files) and maintains a focused set of responsibilities and dependencies."
