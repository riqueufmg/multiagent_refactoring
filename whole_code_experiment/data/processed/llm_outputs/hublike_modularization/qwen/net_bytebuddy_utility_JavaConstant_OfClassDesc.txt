    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JavaConstant has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It interacts with multiple classes and interfaces such as TypeDescription, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, EnumerationDescription, ClassFileLocator, TypePool, StackManipulation, and various ASM types like ConstantDynamic and Handle. Additionally, it contains multiple nested classes (Simple, MethodType, MethodHandle, Dynamic) that also have extensive dependencies with other parts of the system, indicating hub-like modularization."
