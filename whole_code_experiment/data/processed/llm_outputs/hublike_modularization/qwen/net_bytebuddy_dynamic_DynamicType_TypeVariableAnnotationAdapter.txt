        "The class 'DynamicType' is an interface that defines a large number of methods covering various aspects of dynamic type creation and manipulation, including type definitions, bytecode generation, auxiliary type management, class loading, and I/O operations.",
        "It has numerous dependencies both incoming (many classes implement or use this interface) and outgoing (it references many other classes and interfaces from different packages like 'net.bytebuddy.description', 'net.bytebuddy.implementation', 'net.bytebuddy.matcher', etc.).",
        "The interface contains multiple nested interfaces (Builder, Unloaded, Loaded) and static classes which increase its complexity and interconnections.",
        "Its central role in the ByteBuddy library as a core abstraction for dynamic type creation makes it a hub for dependencies, satisfying the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
