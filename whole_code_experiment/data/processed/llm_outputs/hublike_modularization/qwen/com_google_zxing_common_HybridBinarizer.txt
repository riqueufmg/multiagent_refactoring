    "justification": "The HybridBinarizer class has a limited number of dependencies. It extends GlobalHistogramBinarizer and interacts primarily with LuminanceSource and BitMatrix, which are core components necessary for its function as a binarizer in the ZXing library. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
