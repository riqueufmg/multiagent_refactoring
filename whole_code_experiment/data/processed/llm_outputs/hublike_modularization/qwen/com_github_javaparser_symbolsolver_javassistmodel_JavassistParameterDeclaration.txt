    "justification": "The class JavassistParameterDeclaration has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on ResolvedType, TypeSolver, and JavassistFactory for type resolution, and implements the ResolvedParameterDeclaration interface. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
