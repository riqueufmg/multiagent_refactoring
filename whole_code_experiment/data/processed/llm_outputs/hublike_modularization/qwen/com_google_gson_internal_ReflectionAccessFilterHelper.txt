    "justification": "The class ReflectionAccessFilterHelper is used by multiple other classes (ReflectionAccessFilter, ConstructorConstructor, ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory) to perform reflection access filtering checks. It provides static helper methods that are called from various parts of the system, creating a hub of dependencies both incoming (from its users) and outgoing (to Java reflection APIs and internal utilities). Its central role in managing and evaluating reflection access filters for different types makes it a hub-like abstraction with numerous dependencies."
