        "The TreeBuilder class has incoming dependencies from multiple classes such as Parser, HtmlTreeBuilder, and XmlTreeBuilder which rely on it for parsing HTML/XML documents.",
        "It also has outgoing dependencies to numerous classes including Tokeniser, CharacterReader, Document, Element, Node, TagSet, ParseSettings, and others, indicating it interacts with many different components of the system.",
        "The class itself is abstract but plays a central role in the parsing process, coordinating between various other components like tokenisers, readers, and node builders.",
        "Its central position in managing the parsing workflow and maintaining references to many other core classes makes it a hub-like component in the architecture."
