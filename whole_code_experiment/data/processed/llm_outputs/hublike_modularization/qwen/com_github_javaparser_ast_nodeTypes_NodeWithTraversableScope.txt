    "justification": "The interface NodeWithTraversableScope has minimal dependencies with only one method traverseScope() that returns Optional<Expression>. It does not show hub-like modularization as it has limited incoming and outgoing dependencies, serving a single focused purpose of providing scope traversal capability."
