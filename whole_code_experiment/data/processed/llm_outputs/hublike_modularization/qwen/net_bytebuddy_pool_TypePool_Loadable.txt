        "The class has a large number of import dependencies (50+), indicating high connectivity.",
        "It directly depends on numerous core Java classes (List, Map, Set, ConcurrentMap, etc.) and Byte Buddy framework classes.",
        "It is referenced by multiple other classes in the codebase (AnnotationDescription), showing incoming dependencies.",
        "The class contains multiple nested classes and interfaces (Resolution, CacheProvider, Default, etc.), increasing its structural complexity.",
        "It manages core type resolution logic and interacts with ClassFileLocator, AsmClassReader, and various ASM library components, making it central to the type pooling mechanism."
