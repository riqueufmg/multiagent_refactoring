{
    "class": "foo.Foo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Foo has minimal dependencies with other abstractions. It contains only two static methods and no incoming or outgoing dependencies with a large number of other classes. The Main class has a method that takes Foo.Bar as parameter, but this does not establish significant dependency relationships that would indicate hub-like modularization."
