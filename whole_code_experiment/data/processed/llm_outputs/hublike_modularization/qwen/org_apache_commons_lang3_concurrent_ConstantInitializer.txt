    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ConstantInitializer has minimal dependencies. It implements the ConcurrentInitializer interface and uses the ConcurrentException class only through method signatures. It does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions, thus does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
