    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies on numerous other abstractions. It directly interacts with multiple classes and interfaces such as Plugin, MethodAttributeAppender, ElementMatcher, TypeDescription, DynamicType, HashCodeMethod, EqualsMethod, and various ASM classes like MethodVisitor and AnnotationVisitor. Additionally, it defines several nested classes (WithNonNullableFields), enums (Enhance.InvokeSuper, ValueHandling.Sort, AnnotationOrderComparator), and static fields referencing MethodDescription.InDefinedShape. These factors indicate a high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
