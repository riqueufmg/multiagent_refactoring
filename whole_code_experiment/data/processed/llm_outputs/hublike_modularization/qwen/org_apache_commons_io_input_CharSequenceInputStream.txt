        "The class has incoming dependencies from multiple classes in different packages such as org.apache.commons.io.Charsets, org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, and org.apache.commons.io.input.ReaderInputStream.",
        "It also has outgoing dependencies to several classes including java.nio.charset.Charset, java.nio.ByteBuffer, java.nio.CharBuffer, and others in the java.nio package.",
        "The class interacts with numerous abstractions through its Builder inner class which depends on AbstractStreamBuilder and CharsetEncoders.",
        "Its usage of static methods from IOUtils (e.g., IOUtils.EOF, IOUtils.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE) indicates reliance on a central utility class that is likely connected to many other parts of the system.",
        "The presence of multiple constructors and factory methods (builder pattern) suggests it's designed to be used by various clients across the codebase, increasing its connectivity."
