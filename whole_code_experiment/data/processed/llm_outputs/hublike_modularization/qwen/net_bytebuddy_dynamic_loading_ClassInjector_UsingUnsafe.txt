    "justification": "The ClassInjector interface and its nested classes exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It has extensive dependencies both incoming and outgoing. The class directly depends on numerous other classes (e.g., com.sun.jna.*, net.bytebuddy.*, java.lang.*, java.lang.reflect.*, java.security.*, java.util.*, java.io.*, java.net.*, java.lang.instrument.*, org.objectweb.asm.*, edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.*). Additionally, it contains multiple nested classes (UsingReflection, UsingLookup, UsingUnsafe, UsingInstrumentation, UsingJna) each with their own complex dependency structures, creating a central hub for class injection functionality that interacts with various parts of the system, security mechanisms, and external libraries like JNA. This centralization of dependencies for class injection functionality creates a hub-like structure."
