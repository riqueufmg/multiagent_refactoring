    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RenamingPlugin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class RenamingPlugin has a limited set of dependencies. It primarily interacts with ASM classes (ClassVisitor, ClassRemapper, Remapper), Byte Buddy core classes (AsmVisitorWrapper, TypeDescription, DynamicType, Implementation, ElementMatcher, TypePool, ClassFileLocator), and Java standard library classes (Pattern, Matcher, Map, List). It does not exhibit a large number of dependencies with other abstractions in the codebase, nor does it appear to be a central hub connecting many different modules or components. The class has a focused responsibility of renaming types based on provided rules and integrates with the plugin system through the Plugin interface, which is a reasonable modularization for its functionality."
