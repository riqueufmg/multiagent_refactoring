    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.ParameterBinding",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class MethodDelegationBinder.ParameterBinding has dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. It interacts with multiple classes and interfaces such as StackManipulation, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, Assigner, MethodVisitor, Implementation.Context, and various nested classes like Anonymous, Unique, Illegal. It also has multiple implementations and is used across different parts of the codebase, indicating a high degree of connectivity which characterizes the Hub-like Modularization smell."
