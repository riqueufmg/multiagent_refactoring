    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ListLinks has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on Jsoup, Validate, Document, Element, and Elements, all of which are reasonable for a simple example program that fetches and lists links from a URL. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
