    "justification": "The StackManipulation interface defines a clear, focused abstraction for operand stack manipulations. While it has several nested classes and enums (Trivial, Illegal, Size, AbstractBase, Compound, Simple), these are closely related implementations and supporting structures that directly serve the core purpose of stack manipulation. The dependencies are primarily internal (within the same package) and represent different aspects of stack manipulation rather than broad external dependencies. The design follows standard patterns like enums for constants, abstract bases for common behavior, and compound patterns for composition. There is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies with numerous unrelated abstractions that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
