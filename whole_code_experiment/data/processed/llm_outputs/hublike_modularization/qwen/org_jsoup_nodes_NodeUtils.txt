    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.NodeUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "NodeUtils has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It interacts with classes across multiple packages including org.jsoup.helper (Validate, W3CDom), org.jsoup.parser (HtmlTreeBuilder, Parser), org.jsoup.nodes (Node, Element, Document), and java.util (Iterator, List, Spliterator, Stream). It serves as a central utility class that multiple other classes depend on for common operations like output settings retrieval, parser access, xpath selection, and stream creation. This creates a hub-like dependency structure where NodeUtils acts as a central point connecting many other components."
