    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MultipleParentClassLoader does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It has a focused responsibility of managing multiple parent class loaders and delegating class loading operations. Its dependencies are limited to standard Java class loading mechanisms and internal utilities (e.g., ClassLoadingStrategy, InjectionClassLoader). It does not have excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class interacts primarily with java.lang.ClassLoader and related types, which is expected for its role. The CompoundEnumeration and Builder inner classes also maintain cohesive responsibilities without creating a hub-like dependency structure."
