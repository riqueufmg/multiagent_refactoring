    "justification": "The class OnField is a simple wrapper class that implements the Target interface. It has only two methods (visit variants) which delegate to a FieldVisitor. It does not have a large number of dependencies either incoming or outgoing. It's a straightforward, minimal implementation class with a single responsibility."
