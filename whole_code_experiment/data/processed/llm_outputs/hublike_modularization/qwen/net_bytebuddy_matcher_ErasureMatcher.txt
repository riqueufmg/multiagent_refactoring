    "justification": "The ErasureMatcher class has a single dependency on ElementMatcher.Junction.ForNonNullValues (inheritance) and TypeDescription (usage in field and method signatures). It does not exhibit a large number of dependencies either incoming or outgoing, thus does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
