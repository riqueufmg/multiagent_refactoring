    "justification": "The JavaConstant.Dispatcher interface defines a contract for dispatching Java constant types but does not itself have numerous dependencies. The smell of Hub-like Modularization typically applies to classes or modules that have excessive incoming and outgoing dependencies. The interface here is a cohesive abstraction with a single responsibility - to dispatch different types of Java constants. The various nested classes and interfaces within JavaConstant (Simple, MethodType, MethodHandle, Dynamic) are implementations or related types, but Dispatcher itself remains focused. The dependencies it has (like Visitor) are minimal and necessary for its function."
