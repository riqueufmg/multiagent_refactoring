    "justification": "The BooleanMatcher class has minimal dependencies. It only depends on ElementMatcher.Junction.AbstractBase and uses a simple static factory method 'of' to return predefined TRUE or FALSE instances. It does not have numerous incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions. The class is simple and self-contained, serving a single specific purpose of returning a fixed boolean result."
