    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType.WithFlexibleName",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class InstrumentedType.WithFlexibleName exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies on numerous other classes and interfaces within the ByteBuddy framework. It interacts with core type representation classes such as TypeDescription, FieldDescription, MethodDescription, RecordComponentDescription, and their respective tokens and lists (e.g., TypeList, FieldList, MethodList, RecordComponentList). Additionally, it integrates with module and package descriptions (ModuleDescription, PackageDescription), annotation handling (AnnotationDescription, AnnotationList), type initializers (TypeInitializer, LoadedTypeInitializer), and bytecode manipulation components (ByteCodeAppender). The interface also depends on utility classes like ElementMatcher, Transformer, and various visitor patterns (Generic.Visitor.Substitutor, Generic.Visitor.ForDetachment), demonstrating a high degree of incoming and outgoing dependencies which centralizes changes and increases coupling."
