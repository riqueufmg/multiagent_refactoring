    "justification": "The class BookResultInfoRetriever has a limited number of dependencies. It directly interacts with a few well-defined abstractions: HttpHelper for network operations, LocaleManager for locale-specific logic, and HistoryManager for history-related functionality. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
