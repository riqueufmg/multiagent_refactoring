    "detection": true,
    "justification": "CopyUtils acts as a hub-like module by providing numerous static utility methods for copying data between various I/O sources and destinations (InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer, String, byte[]). It has extensive dependencies on other classes in the same package (e.g., IOUtils) and serves as a central point for I/O copy operations. The class is also marked as deprecated with a note that its methods have been renamed to IOUtils.write() or IOUtils.copy(), indicating it was a hub that has been superseded by another hub (IOUtils). The large number of cross-references and its role as a central utility for I/O operations confirms hub-like modularization."
