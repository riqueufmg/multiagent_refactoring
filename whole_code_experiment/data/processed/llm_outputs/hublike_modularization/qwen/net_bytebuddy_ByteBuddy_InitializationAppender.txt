    "justification": "The class ByteBuddy has a large number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with other abstractions. It imports and uses numerous classes from various packages including net.bytebuddy.description.*, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.*, net.bytebuddy.implementation.*, net.bytebuddy.matcher.*, and org.objectweb.asm.*. Additionally, it has extensive configuration methods (with methods) that allow customization of various aspects like ClassFileVersion, NamingStrategy, AnnotationValueFilter, Implementation.Context.Factory, MethodGraph.Compiler, etc. The class serves as a central entry point for the library's functionality and interacts with many other components, making it a hub-like abstraction with high connectivity to other parts of the system."
