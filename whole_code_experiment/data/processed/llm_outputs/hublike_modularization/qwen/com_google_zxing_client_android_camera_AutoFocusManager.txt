    "justification": "The AutoFocusManager class has a limited number of dependencies. It interacts directly with Camera, SharedPreferences, and a few Android framework classes like AsyncTask and Context. It is used exclusively by CameraManager for managing camera autofocus functionality. There are no excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would classify it as hub-like modularization."
