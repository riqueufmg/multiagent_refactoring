    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies on numerous other abstractions. It imports and interacts with a large number of classes from the Gson library (e.g., Gson, TypeAdapter, JsonReader, JsonWriter, Excluder, FieldNamingStrategy, JsonAdapterAnnotationTypeAdapterFactory, ReflectionAccessFilter, etc.) and Java reflection APIs (e.g., Field, Method, Constructor, AccessibleObject). Additionally, it defines inner classes (BoundField, Adapter, FieldReflectionAdapter, RecordAdapter) that further increase its coupling with various parts of the system. The class serves as a central hub for reflective type adaptation, coordinating interactions between many other components, which results in high incoming and outgoing dependencies."
