    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FastDatePrinter does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It is a self-contained date formatting utility with a well-defined responsibility. Its dependencies are limited to standard Java libraries (java.text, java.util, java.io) and a few internal Apache Commons Lang utilities (CharUtils, ClassUtils, LocaleUtils, ExceptionUtils). It does not act as a central hub connecting a large number of other abstractions. The class primarily uses these dependencies for its core functionality: parsing date patterns, formatting dates, and handling time zones/locales. The numerous inner classes are implementation details encapsulated within the class, serving specific formatting rules, and do not contribute to hub-like behavior. The class has a clear, single responsibility and does not mediate interactions between many other components."
