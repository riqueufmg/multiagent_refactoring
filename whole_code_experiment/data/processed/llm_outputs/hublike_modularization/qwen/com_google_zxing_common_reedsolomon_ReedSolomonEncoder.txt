    "justification": "The ReedSolomonEncoder class has a limited number of dependencies. It directly interacts with GenericGF and GenericGFPoly within the same package, and is used by the Encoder class in a different package. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize hub-like modularization."
