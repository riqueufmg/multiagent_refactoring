    "justification": "The class has numerous dependencies on external JMH framework classes such as InfraControl, ThreadParams, BenchmarkTaskResult, RawResults, Blackhole, and various annotations and result types. It also directly interacts with ClassByImplementationBenchmark_jmhType for benchmark execution, showing both incoming (uses) and outgoing (used by) relationships with many abstractions."
