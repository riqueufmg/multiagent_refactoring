    "justification": "MethodStrictness is a simple enum with minimal dependencies. It implements two interfaces (ForMethod and ForType) but does not have numerous incoming or outgoing dependencies. It only interacts with Opcodes from ASM library and does not serve as a hub connecting to many other abstractions. The class has a very limited scope - it only deals with strictfp modifier handling."
