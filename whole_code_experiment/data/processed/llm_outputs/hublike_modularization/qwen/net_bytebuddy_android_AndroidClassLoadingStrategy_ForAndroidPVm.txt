        "The class has a large number of imports from various packages including android.os, com.android.dx, dalvik.system, edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations, net.bytebuddy, java.io, java.lang.reflect, java.util, java.util.jar, and java.util.logging indicating high outgoing dependencies.",
        "It defines multiple nested interfaces and classes (FileProcessor, DexProcessor, Wrapping, Injecting) that increase its structural complexity and internal coupling.",
        "The class directly interacts with low-level Android APIs such as DexClassLoader, BaseDexClassLoader, and Dalvik system components, creating tight coupling with Android-specific abstractions.",
        "It manages complex workflows involving file I/O operations, reflection usage for method invocations, and dynamic class loading mechanisms which increases its responsibility scope.",
        "The static initialization block resolves platform-specific dispatchers through reflection, adding to the class's complexity and dependency on runtime environment specifics."
