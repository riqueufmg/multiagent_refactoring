    "justification": "The HttpConnection class acts as a hub for managing HTTP requests and responses, coordinating interactions between multiple components such as Request, Response, KeyVal, and various utility classes (e.g., DataUtil, ControllableInputStream). It has numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies, including handling SSL contexts, proxy settings, authentication, data serialization, and response parsing. This central role with extensive coupling to other abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
