    "justification": "The Code128Reader class has a limited number of dependencies. It primarily interacts with core ZXing classes such as BarcodeFormat, Result, ResultMetadataType, ResultPoint, BitArray, and exception classes (NotFoundException, FormatException, ChecksumException). These are essential dependencies for its function as a barcode reader and do not indicate hub-like modularization. The class does not show excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would classify it as a hub."
