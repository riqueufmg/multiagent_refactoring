    "justification": "The class NamingStrategy.AbstractBase has very limited dependencies. It only depends on TypeDescription and RandomString, and it's an abstract base class with minimal functionality. It does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions, which is the key indicator of Hub-like Modularization. The class serves a single, focused purpose as a base implementation for naming strategies and does not act as a central hub connecting many different modules or components."
