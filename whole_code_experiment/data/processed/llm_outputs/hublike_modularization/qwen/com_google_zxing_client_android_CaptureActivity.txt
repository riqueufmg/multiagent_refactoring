    "justification": "The CaptureActivity class has extensive dependencies both incoming and outgoing. It imports and uses numerous classes from different packages including com.google.zxing, com.google.zxing.client.android.camera, com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard, com.google.zxing.client.android.history, com.google.zxing.client.android.result, and others. It also interacts with many Android framework classes and has complex relationships with helper classes like CameraManager, BeepManager, AmbientLightManager, HistoryManager, and various Result handling classes. The class itself is large and orchestrates many different functionalities including camera management, barcode decoding, result handling, UI management, and various Android system interactions, making it a central hub with high coupling to many other components."
