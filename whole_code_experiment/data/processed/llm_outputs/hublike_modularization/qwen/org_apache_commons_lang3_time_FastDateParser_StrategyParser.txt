    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FastDateParser does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It encapsulates parsing logic internally and has a well-defined interface through the DateParser interface. Its dependencies are limited to standard Java libraries (java.util, java.text, java.io) and a few internal utilities (org.apache.commons.lang3). It does not have excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions. The class is focused on parsing date strings and manages its dependencies through contained static and inner classes that support its core functionality without creating a hub-like dependency structure."
