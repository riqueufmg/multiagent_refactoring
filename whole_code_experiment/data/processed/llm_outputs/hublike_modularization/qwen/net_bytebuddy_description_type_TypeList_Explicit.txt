    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TypeList.Explicit has a limited number of dependencies. It primarily interacts with TypeDescription and JavaConstant, and does not exhibit a high number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would classify it as a hub-like modularization. The class serves a specific purpose of wrapping explicit lists of types and provides a factory method for creating instances from Java constants. It does not act as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
