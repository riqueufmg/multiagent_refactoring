    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.NumberTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The NumberTypeAdapter class has limited dependencies. It depends on a small set of classes such as ToNumberPolicy, ToNumberStrategy, TypeAdapter, TypeAdapterFactory, and JsonReader/JsonWriter. It is not a hub-like class with numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies. It serves a specific purpose of handling Number type serialization/deserialization and does not act as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
