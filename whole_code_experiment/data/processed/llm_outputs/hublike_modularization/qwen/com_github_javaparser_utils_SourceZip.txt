    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceZip",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class SourceZip has incoming dependencies from its usage of JavaParser, ParseResult, ParserConfiguration, and Callback interface. It also has outgoing dependencies to these classes/interfaces as it creates instances of JavaParser, uses ParseResult for handling parsing outcomes, relies on ParserConfiguration for parser settings, and defines a Callback interface for processing results. This bidirectional dependency with multiple abstractions indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
