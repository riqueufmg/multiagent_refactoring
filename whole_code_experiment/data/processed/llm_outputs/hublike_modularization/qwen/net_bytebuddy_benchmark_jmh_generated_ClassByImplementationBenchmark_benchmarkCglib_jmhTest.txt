    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing. It imports and uses many JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) classes such as InfraControl, ThreadParams, BenchmarkTaskResult, RawResults, Blackhole, Control, BenchmarkParams, IterationParams, and various Result classes. Additionally, it interacts with ClassByImplementationBenchmark_jmhType through multiple methods, showing high coupling. The class also contains numerous fields related to benchmarking infrastructure and padding, indicating it serves as a central hub coordinating benchmark execution, setup, and result aggregation."
