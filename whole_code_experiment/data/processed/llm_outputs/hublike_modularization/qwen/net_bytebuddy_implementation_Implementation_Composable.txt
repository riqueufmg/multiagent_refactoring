    "justification": "The class 'Implementation' has a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing. It interacts with numerous other classes and interfaces such as 'ByteCodeAppender', 'SpecialMethodInvocation', 'Target', 'Context', 'Compound', 'Simple', etc. Additionally, it defines multiple nested interfaces and classes, each with their own set of dependencies, making it a hub-like module that centralizes interactions between various components."
