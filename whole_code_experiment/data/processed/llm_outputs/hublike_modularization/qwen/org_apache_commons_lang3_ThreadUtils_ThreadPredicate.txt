    "justification": "The class ThreadUtils is a utility class that provides static methods for thread and thread group operations. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing with other abstractions. The class encapsulates thread-related functionalities and uses standard Java libraries and its own utility classes like Predicates and DurationUtils, but does not act as a central hub connecting numerous other modules or abstractions."
