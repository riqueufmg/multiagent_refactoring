    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BooleanConditionalExprHandler has minimal dependencies. It implements the ConditionalExprHandler interface and uses ResolvedType, but does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions. It serves a very specific and limited purpose, thus does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
