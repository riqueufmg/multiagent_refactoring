    "justification": "The class ModifierValidator has dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. It extends VisitorValidator and interacts with various node types such as ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, EnumDeclaration, AnnotationDeclaration, ConstructorDeclaration, FieldDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, LambdaExpr, CatchClause, VariableDeclarationExpr, and ModuleRequiresDirective. It also uses ProblemReporter for reporting issues and utilizes utility classes like SeparatedItemStringBuilder. Additionally, it handles multiple Modifier.Keyword arrays and validation logic involving numerous modifier combinations, indicating a high degree of connectivity and responsibility, which are characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
