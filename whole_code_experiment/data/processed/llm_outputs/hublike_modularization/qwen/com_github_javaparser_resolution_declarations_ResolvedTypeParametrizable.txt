    "justification": "The ResolvedTypeParametrizable interface defines a minimal contract for entities with type parameters and has only three methods: getTypeParameters, findTypeParameter, and isGeneric. It does not exhibit a high number of dependencies either incoming or outgoing. The classes that implement or interact with it (e.g., ReflectionTypeParameter, JavaParserTypeParameter, JavassistTypeParameter) depend on it, but the interface itself does not depend on a large number of other abstractions. Therefore, it does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
