    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class SubtypeOfBound has a limited number of dependencies. It primarily interacts with TypeHelper for utility methods and uses basic types from com.github.javaparser.resolution.types. It does not exhibit a high number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize hub-like modularization."
