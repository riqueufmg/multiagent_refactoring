    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class LongConstant has limited dependencies. It depends on StackSize, StackManipulation, MethodVisitor, and Opcodes. It is not a hub-like module because it does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It serves a specific purpose of loading long constants onto the operand stack and interacts with only a few other abstractions."
