    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class Safelist has high incoming and outgoing dependencies. It is depended upon by many other classes (high incoming coupling), as it is a core configuration class for HTML cleaning. It also depends on multiple classes like Validate, Normalizer, Attribute, Attributes, Element, and several internal static classes (TagName, AttributeKey, AttributeValue, Protocol, TypedValue), indicating high outgoing coupling. This central role with many dependencies in both directions classifies it as Hub-like Modularization."
