    "justification": "The Solver interface has dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. It uses or references the following classes: SymbolReference, ResolvedValueDeclaration, Value, ResolvedTypeDeclaration, MethodUsage, ResolvedType, Context, Node, Type, ResolvedDeclaration, UnsolvedSymbolException, List, Optional, Class. This high number of dependencies indicates Hub-like Modularization."
