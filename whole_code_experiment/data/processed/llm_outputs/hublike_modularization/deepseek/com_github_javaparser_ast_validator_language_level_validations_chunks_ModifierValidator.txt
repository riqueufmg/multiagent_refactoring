    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ModifierValidator has dependencies with 12 other abstractions: ProblemReporter, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, ModuleRequiresDirective, SeparatedItemStringBuilder, MethodDeclaration, CatchClause, AnnotationDeclaration, Modifier, ConstructorDeclaration, LambdaExpr, VariableDeclarationExpr, FieldDeclaration, EnumDeclaration, TypeDeclaration, and AnnotationMemberDeclaration. It receives dependencies from VisitorValidator (inheritance) and provides dependencies to all these classes through its validation methods, making it a hub with both incoming and outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions."
