    "justification": "The interface ClassFileLocator has a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It is implemented by 10+ inner classes (NoOp, MultiReleaseAware, Simple, ForClassLoader, ForModule, ForJarFile, ForModuleFile, ForFolder, ForUrl, ForInstrumentation, PackageDiscriminating, Filtering, Compound) and has dependencies on numerous other abstractions including ClassFileVersion, DynamicType, TypeDescription, JavaModule, StreamDrainer, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AccessControllerPlugin, and many Java standard library classes. The interface serves as a central hub for class file location functionality with extensive coupling."
