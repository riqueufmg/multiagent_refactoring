    "justification": "The TypeDescription interface has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions including TypeDefinition, ByteCodeElement, TypeVariableSource, AnnotationDescription, AnnotationList, AnnotationSource, EnumerationDescription, FieldDescription, FieldList, MethodDescription, MethodList, ParameterDescription, ModuleDescription, ClassFileVersion, ElementMatcher, JavaType, and many more from the java.lang.reflect package. It defines numerous nested interfaces and classes (Generic, AbstractBase, ForLoadedType, ArrayProjection, etc.) that further increase its coupling. The extensive import list and the complex hierarchy demonstrate hub-like modularization where this central abstraction mediates between many different components of the ByteBuddy library."
