    "justification": "The interface has only one outgoing dependency (java.util.function.ObjIntConsumer) and no incoming dependencies shown in the provided context. It defines a single abstract method, a static factory method, and a singleton constant, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies with other abstractions."
