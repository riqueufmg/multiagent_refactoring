    "justification": "TooltipUtil has only one static method that depends on ParseUtil and StringUtil (2 outgoing dependencies) and is called by BytecodeAnnotationBuilder and CompileChainWalker (2 incoming dependencies). This small number of dependencies (2 incoming, 2 outgoing) does not meet the threshold for Hub-like Modularization."
