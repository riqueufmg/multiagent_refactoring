    "justification": "The LazyInterfaceList class is a small, focused inner class that serves as a lazy projection for interface types. It has minimal dependencies (only depends on its enclosing TypeDescription class and a few utility classes) and does not act as a central hub with numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies."
