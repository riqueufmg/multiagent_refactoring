    "justification": "The class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it imports 28 different types from various packages (java.util, org.openjdk.jmh.annotations, org.openjdk.jmh.results, org.openjdk.jmh.infra, etc.), extends Object (implicitly), and collaborates with multiple JMH framework classes (InfraControl, ThreadParams, Blackhole, Control, RawResults, BenchmarkTaskResult, etc.) across its methods. It acts as a central hub connecting to numerous JMH components for benchmarking functionality."
