    "detection": true,
    "justification": "DocBuilder has dependencies with 7 other abstractions: Doc, Doc.Level, Indent, Op, OpenOp, CloseOp, and Doc.Break. It receives incoming dependencies from Op implementations (Token, Space, Break, Tok, OpenOp, CloseOp) and has outgoing dependencies to Doc, Doc.Level, and Indent. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
