    "justification": "RecordAdapter has limited dependencies: it extends ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter, uses standard Java classes (Constructor, Map, Object[], etc.), and only interacts with a few Gson internal classes (ReflectionHelper, BoundField). It does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions."
