    "justification": "The FixedValue class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: incoming dependencies from ByteCodeAppender, NullConstant, MethodReturn, and its own inner classes; outgoing dependencies to ByteCodeAppender, StackManipulation, Assigner, TypeDescription, MethodDescription, InstrumentedType, FieldDescription, ConstantValue, JavaConstant, RandomString, and multiple bytecode manipulation classes (ClassConstant, NullConstant, FieldAccess, MethodReturn, MethodVariableAccess). It serves as a central hub coordinating various fixed value implementations."
