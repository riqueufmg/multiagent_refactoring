    "justification": "The ClassLoadingStrategy interface has a large number of dependencies with other abstractions. It has incoming dependencies from multiple inner classes (Default, Configurable, UsingLookup, ForBootstrapInjection, ForUnsafeInjection, ForJnaInjection) and outgoing dependencies to numerous other classes including ClassInjector, ByteArrayClassLoader, PackageDefinitionStrategy, ClassLoaderDecorator, TypeDescription, ProtectionDomain, Instrumentation, File, Map, and various Java standard library classes. The interface serves as a central hub coordinating different class loading strategies and their configurations."
