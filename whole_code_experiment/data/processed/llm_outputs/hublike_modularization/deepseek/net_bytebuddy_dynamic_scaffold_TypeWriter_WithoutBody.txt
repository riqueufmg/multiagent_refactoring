    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter$Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it imports 68 classes from various packages, implements multiple nested interfaces (FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool), contains inner classes (UnresolvedType, ValidatingClassVisitor, ForInlining, ForCreation), and collaborates with numerous external types (TypeDescription, ClassFileVersion, DynamicType, Implementation, AnnotationValueFilter, etc.). This central role in coordinating class file generation makes it a hub-like modularization."
