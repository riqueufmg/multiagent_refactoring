    "justification": "The ErrorCorrection class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ModulusGF and ModulusPoly) and 1 incoming dependency (PDF417ScanningDecoder), which does not constitute a large number of dependencies in either direction. It serves a focused error correction purpose without being a central hub."
