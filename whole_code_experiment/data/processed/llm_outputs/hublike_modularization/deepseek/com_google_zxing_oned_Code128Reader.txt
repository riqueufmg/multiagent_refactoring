    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from Code128Writer (which references its CODE_PATTERNS array) and outgoing dependencies to 8 other abstractions: BarcodeFormat, ChecksumException, DecodeHintType, FormatException, NotFoundException, Result, ResultMetadataType, ResultPoint, and BitArray. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies qualifies it as a hub-like modularization."
