    "justification": "The Functions class acts as a central hub with numerous dependencies. It defines 9 functional interfaces (FailableBiConsumer, FailableBiFunction, FailableBiPredicate, FailableCallable, FailableConsumer, FailableFunction, FailablePredicate, FailableRunnable, FailableSupplier) and provides 28 static methods that interact with these interfaces and standard Java functional types (BiConsumer, BiFunction, BiPredicate, Callable, Consumer, Function, Predicate, Runnable, Supplier). It also depends on external classes like ExceptionUtils, Failable, FailableBooleanSupplier, and FailableStream, creating a high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
