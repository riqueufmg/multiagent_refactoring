    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.DefaultValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The DefaultValue class has only 2 incoming dependencies (from StubMethod and VoidAwareAssigner) and 6 outgoing dependencies (to IntegerConstant, LongConstant, FloatConstant, DoubleConstant, Trivial, and NullConstant). This does not constitute a large number of dependencies in either direction, and the class serves a specific, focused purpose of providing default values for different types."
