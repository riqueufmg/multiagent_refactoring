    "justification": "AbstractFormatCache has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: incoming dependencies from FastDateFormat (which uses it as a cache), TimeZones (via toTimeZone method), LocaleUtils (via toLocale method), and java.text.Format/DateFormat/SimpleDateFormat; outgoing dependencies to TimeZones, LocaleUtils, ConcurrentMap, ArrayKey, Format, and various Java standard library classes. It acts as a central hub for formatting operations with both incoming and outgoing connections to multiple abstractions."
