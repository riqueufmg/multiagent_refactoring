    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender$ForTypeAnnotations",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It depends on: AnnotationAppender, AnnotationValueFilter, TypeDescription.Generic.Visitor, TypeDescription.Generic, TypeList.Generic, AnnotationDescription, TypeReference, TypePath, and multiple ASM classes (AnnotationVisitor, ClassVisitor, FieldVisitor, MethodVisitor, RecordComponentVisitor). It also has incoming dependencies from AnnotationAppender.Default and multiple static factory methods that create instances of ForTypeAnnotations, indicating it acts as a central hub for type annotation appending."
