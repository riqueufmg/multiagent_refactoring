    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has numerous incoming dependencies (imports from 25 different packages) and outgoing dependencies (it defines 8 inner classes/interfaces, extends InjectionClassLoader, implements multiple methods with complex parameter/return types, and interacts with many external types like ConcurrentMap, Enumeration, URL, ProtectionDomain, etc.). This high coupling with many other abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
