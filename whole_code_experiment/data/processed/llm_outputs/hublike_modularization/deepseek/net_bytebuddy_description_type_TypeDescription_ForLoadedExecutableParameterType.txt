    "justification": "The TypeDescription interface has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It directly depends on 35 imported classes/interfaces from its own package and 45 imported classes/interfaces from external packages. It also defines multiple nested interfaces (Generic, Visitor, AnnotationReader, etc.) that themselves have extensive dependencies. The interface serves as a central hub for type description functionality with both incoming and outgoing dependencies across the Byte Buddy framework."
