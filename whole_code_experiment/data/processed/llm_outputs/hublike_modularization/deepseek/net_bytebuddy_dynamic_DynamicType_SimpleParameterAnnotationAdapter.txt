    "justification": "The DynamicType interface has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It imports 71 classes from various packages (net.bytebuddy.*, org.objectweb.asm, java.*, etc.), defines 5 nested interfaces (Builder, Unloaded, Loaded, ModuleDefinition, InnerTypeDefinition) with extensive method signatures referencing many types, and serves as a central hub for dynamic type creation with numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies across the Byte Buddy framework."
