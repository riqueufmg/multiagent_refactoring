    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The LockingVisitors class acts as a central hub with numerous dependencies. It has incoming dependencies from three specialized visitor classes (ReentrantLockVisitor, ReadWriteLockVisitor, StampedLockVisitor) that extend its inner LockVisitor class. It also has outgoing dependencies to multiple Java concurrency classes (Lock, ReadWriteLock, ReentrantLock, ReentrantReadWriteLock, StampedLock) and Apache Commons utility classes (AbstractSupplier, Failable, FailableConsumer, FailableFunction, Suppliers). The class serves as a factory creating instances of all three visitor types and contains the core LockVisitor abstraction that all specialized visitors depend on."
