    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.PrettyPrinterConfiguration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has dependencies with 6 other abstractions: Indentation, ConfigurationOption, DefaultPrinterConfiguration, PrinterConfiguration, PrettyPrintVisitor, and PrettyPrinter. It has incoming dependencies from PrettyPrintVisitor and PrettyPrinter, and outgoing dependencies to Indentation, ConfigurationOption, DefaultPrinterConfiguration, and PrinterConfiguration. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
