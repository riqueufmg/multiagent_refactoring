    "justification": "AutoFocusManager has limited dependencies: incoming from CameraManager (creates it), outgoing to Camera (Android API), AsyncTask (Android API), PreferencesActivity (constant only), and its inner class AutoFocusTask. The number of distinct abstractions is small (5-6), not constituting a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies typical of a hub."
