    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Uncheck class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it imports and uses multiple functional interfaces (IOBiConsumer, IOConsumer, IOIntConsumer, IOTriConsumer, IOBiFunction, IOFunction, IOQuadFunction, IOTriFunction, IOComparator, IOSupplier, IOBooleanSupplier, IOIntSupplier, IOLongSupplier, IORunnable, IOPredicate), IOException, UncheckedIOException, and Supplier. It also has outgoing dependencies to all these types through its method parameters and return types, making it a central hub for unchecked IO operations."
