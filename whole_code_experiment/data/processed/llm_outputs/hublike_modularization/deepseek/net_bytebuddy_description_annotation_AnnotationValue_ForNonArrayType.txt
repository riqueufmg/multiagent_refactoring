    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The interface AnnotationValue has a large number of dependencies with other abstractions. It contains 7 inner classes (ForConstant, ForAnnotationDescription, ForEnumerationDescription, ForTypeDescription, ForDescriptionArray, ForMissingType, ForMismatchedType, ForMissingValue, ForIncompatibleType), 2 inner enums (RenderingDispatcher, State, Sort), and 1 inner interface (Loaded). Additionally, it imports and depends on numerous external classes including ClassFileVersion, EnumerationDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDefinition, TypeDescription, ClassFileLocator, and various Java reflection and annotation types. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
