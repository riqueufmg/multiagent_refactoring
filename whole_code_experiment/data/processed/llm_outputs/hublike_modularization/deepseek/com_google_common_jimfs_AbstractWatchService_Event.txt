    "justification": "The class AbstractWatchService has incoming dependencies from its inner classes Event and Key, and outgoing dependencies to numerous external classes (e.g., WatchService, WatchKey, WatchEvent, Watchable, BlockingQueue, AtomicBoolean, AtomicInteger, AtomicReference, ImmutableSet, ImmutableList, IOException, ClosedWatchServiceException, TimeUnit). It also manages and interacts with many abstractions, acting as a central hub for watch service operations."
