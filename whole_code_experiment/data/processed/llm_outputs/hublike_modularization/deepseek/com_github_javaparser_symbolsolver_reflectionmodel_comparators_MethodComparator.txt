    "class": com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionClassDeclaration,
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ReflectionClassDeclaration has numerous incoming dependencies (it extends AbstractClassDeclaration and implements MethodUsageResolutionCapability, SymbolResolutionCapability) and outgoing dependencies (it imports and uses many classes from various packages, including java.lang.reflect, java.util, com.github.javaparser.resolution, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver, and others). It also depends on multiple other abstractions like ReflectionClassAdapter, ReflectionMethodDeclaration, ReflectionFieldDeclaration, MethodComparator, and various interfaces and classes from the JavaParser ecosystem, indicating a hub-like structure with high coupling."
