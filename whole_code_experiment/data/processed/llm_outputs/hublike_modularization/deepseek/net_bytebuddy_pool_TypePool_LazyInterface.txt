    "justification": "The LazyInterface class is a small inner class with limited dependencies. It only depends on its enclosing class (TypePool.Default.WithLazyResolution.ExtendedLazyTypeDescription.LazyInterfaceList) and a few core types (Generic.LazyProjection.WithLazyNavigation, AnnotationList, TypeDescription). It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
