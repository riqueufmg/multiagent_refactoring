    "justification": "The InvocationFactory interface has only 2 incoming dependencies (from TypeProxy and TypeProxy.Default) and 2 outgoing dependencies (to Implementation.Target and Implementation.SpecialMethodInvocation). This limited number of dependencies does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization, which requires a 'large number' of dependencies in both directions."
