It depends on 28 other classes (ByteCodeAppender, StackManipulation, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, etc.) and is depended upon by 2 other classes (ByteCodeAppender and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). The interface contains 5 nested interfaces (Composable, SpecialMethodInvocation, Target, Context, ExtractableView) and 4 nested classes (Compound, Simple, Illegal, AbstractBase) with extensive functionality, making it a central hub in the codebase."
