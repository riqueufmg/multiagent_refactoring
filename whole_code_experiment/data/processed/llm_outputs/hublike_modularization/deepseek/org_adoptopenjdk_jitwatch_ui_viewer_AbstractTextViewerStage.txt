    "justification": "JITWatchUI has incoming dependencies from AbstractTextViewerStage, Viewer, UserInterfaceUtil, and many other UI components. It also has outgoing dependencies to numerous abstractions including IStageAccessProxy, IJITListener, ILogParseErrorListener, IStageClosedListener, IMemberSelectedListener, IParserSelectedListener, and concrete classes like MainConfigStage, TimeLineStage, StatsStage, HistoStage, TopListStage, CodeCacheStage, CodeCacheLayoutStage, CompilerThreadStage, TriView, BrowserStage, ReportStage, SandboxStage, TextViewerStage, JournalViewerStage, CompileChainStage, and many model classes. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
