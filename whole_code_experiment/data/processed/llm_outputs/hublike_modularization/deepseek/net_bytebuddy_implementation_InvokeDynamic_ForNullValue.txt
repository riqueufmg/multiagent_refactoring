    "justification": "The class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it imports 45 classes from various packages (net.bytebuddy.description, net.bytebuddy.dynamic, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode, net.bytebuddy.utility, org.objectweb.asm, java.lang.reflect, java.util), defines multiple inner classes and interfaces (InvocationProvider, TerminationHandler, AbstractDelegator, WithImplicitArguments, WithImplicitTarget, WithImplicitType, Appender), and interacts with numerous external types (MethodDescription, TypeDescription, JavaConstant, Assigner, StackManipulation, etc.). Its methods return and accept many different types, making it a central hub in the codebase."
