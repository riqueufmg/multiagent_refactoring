    "justification": "The SignatureKey class is a simple inner class with only two fields (internalName and descriptor) and basic equals/hashCode methods. It has no dependencies on other abstractions, neither incoming nor outgoing, and serves only as a data holder for field/method signatures within the TypeWriter context."
