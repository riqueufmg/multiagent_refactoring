    "justification": "PackageManager has incoming dependencies from MetaClass, ParseUtil, JITDataModel, AssemblyProcessor, BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, ClassSearch, and JITWatchUI. It has outgoing dependencies to MetaClass and MetaPackage. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub for managing package and class metadata across the system."
