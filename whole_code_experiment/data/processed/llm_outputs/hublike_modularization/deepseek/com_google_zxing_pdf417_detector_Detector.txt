    "justification": "The Detector class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (BinaryBitmap, PDF417DetectorResult) and 1 incoming dependency (PDF417Reader), which is a small number of dependencies in both directions. It does not act as a central hub with a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies."
