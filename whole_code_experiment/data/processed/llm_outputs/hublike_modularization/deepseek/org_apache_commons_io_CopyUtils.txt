    "justification": "CopyUtils has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: incoming dependencies from IOUtils (static import of EOF, ScratchChars), ByteArrayInputStream, StringReader, InputStreamReader, OutputStreamWriter, and outgoing dependencies to InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer, String, byte[], Charset, IOException, and IOUtils. It acts as a central hub for copying operations between various source and destination types."
