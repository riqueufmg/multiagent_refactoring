    "justification": "The Encoder class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: incoming dependencies from AztecWriter (calls encode methods), HighLevelEncoder (used in encode method), and outgoing dependencies to BitArray, BitMatrix, GenericGF, ReedSolomonEncoder, AztecCode, and HighLevelEncoder. It acts as a central hub coordinating the entire Aztec encoding process."
