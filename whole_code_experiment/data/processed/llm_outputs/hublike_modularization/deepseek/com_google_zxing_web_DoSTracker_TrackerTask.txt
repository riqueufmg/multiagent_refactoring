    "justification": "The TrackerTask inner class has only 2 incoming dependencies (from DoSTracker constructor and run method) and 2 outgoing dependencies (to java.lang.management.OperatingSystemMXBean and java.util.logging.Logger). This limited number of dependencies in both directions does not meet the threshold for Hub-like Modularization."
