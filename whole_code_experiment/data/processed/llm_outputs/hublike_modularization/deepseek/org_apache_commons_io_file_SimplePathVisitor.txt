    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.SimplePathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SimplePathVisitor has limited dependencies: it extends SimpleFileVisitor<Path> and implements PathVisitor, uses IOBiFunction, and contains an inner AbstractBuilder class. It has only 2-3 incoming dependencies (from CountingPathVisitor) and 2-3 outgoing dependencies (to SimpleFileVisitor, PathVisitor, IOBiFunction), which does not constitute a large number of dependencies typical of Hub-like Modularization."
