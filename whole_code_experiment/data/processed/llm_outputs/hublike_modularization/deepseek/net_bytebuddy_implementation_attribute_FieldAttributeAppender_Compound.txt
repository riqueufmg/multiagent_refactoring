    "justification": "The FieldAttributeAppender.Compound class has limited dependencies: it depends on FieldAttributeAppender interface, FieldDescription, FieldVisitor, AnnotationValueFilter, and standard Java collections. It has only 2-3 incoming dependencies from other FieldAttributeAppender implementations and 2-3 outgoing dependencies to other classes. This does not constitute a large number of dependencies in either direction."
