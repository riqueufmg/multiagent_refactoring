    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it implements WatchService interface, depends on WatchKey, WatchEvent, Watchable from java.nio.file, uses multiple concurrency classes (BlockingQueue, AtomicBoolean, AtomicInteger, AtomicReference), imports utility classes from com.google.common (Preconditions, MoreObjects, ImmutableList, ImmutableSet), and contains two inner classes (Event and Key) that further increase dependency connections."
