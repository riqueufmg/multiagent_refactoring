    "justification": "The MethodGraph interface has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions including: MethodDescription, MethodList, TypeDefinition, TypeDescription, ElementMatcher, FilterableList, Visibility, Node, NodeList, Linked, Compiler, Default, Harmonizer, Merger, Key, Store, Entry, Graph, Simple, and Empty. It also contains multiple nested interfaces and classes that depend on each other, creating a hub-like structure with both incoming and outgoing dependencies across the entire method graph hierarchy."
