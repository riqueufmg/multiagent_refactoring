    "justification": "The Regex class has incoming dependencies from Re2jRegex (via static method call) and potentially many other classes that use regex functionality. It has outgoing dependencies to java.util.regex.Pattern, java.lang.reflect classes, System, SharedConstants, Re2jRegex, and ValidationException. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub."
