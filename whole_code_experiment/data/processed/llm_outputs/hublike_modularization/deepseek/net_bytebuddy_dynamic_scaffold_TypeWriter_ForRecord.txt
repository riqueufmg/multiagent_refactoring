    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The TypeWriter interface and its inner classes (FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool, Default, ForInlining, ForCreation) have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class imports 58 different types from various packages (net.bytebuddy.description, net.bytebuddy.implementation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic, org.objectweb.asm, etc.) and defines multiple nested interfaces and classes that interact with these dependencies. The abstraction serves as a central hub for class file generation, coordinating field, method, and record component handling, type validation, annotation processing, and ASM visitor wrapping, resulting in extensive incoming and outgoing dependencies."
