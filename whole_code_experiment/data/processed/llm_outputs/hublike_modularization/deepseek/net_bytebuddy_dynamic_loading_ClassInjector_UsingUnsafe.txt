    "justification": "The ClassInjector interface and its inner classes have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It imports 45 classes from various packages (net.bytebuddy.*, com.sun.jna.*, java.lang.reflect.*, java.security.*, java.util.*, etc.), defines 5 major inner classes (AbstractBase, UsingReflection, UsingLookup, UsingUnsafe, UsingInstrumentation, UsingJna) each with their own complex internal structures, and interacts with multiple external systems (reflection, unsafe, instrumentation, JNA). The class acts as a central hub for class injection strategies, coordinating between diverse implementation approaches and numerous dependent types."
