    "justification": "The Position class has minimal dependencies: it only imports java.util.Objects and uses assertNotNull from utils. It has no outgoing dependencies to other abstractions in the provided context, and only Node and Range have incoming dependencies to Position. This limited number of dependencies does not meet the threshold for Hub-like Modularization."
