    "detection": true,
    "justification": "JavaParserMetaModel has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It contains static references to 134 different meta-model classes (e.g., nodeMetaModel, bodyDeclarationMetaModel, annotationExprMetaModel, etc.), initializes them in static blocks, and provides access methods. This creates both incoming dependencies (other classes depend on it for meta-model retrieval) and outgoing dependencies (it depends on all meta-model classes), making it a central hub in the metamodel package."
