    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Safelist",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Safelist class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It imports and uses: org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer, org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes, org.jsoup.nodes.Element. Additionally, it contains four inner classes (TagName, AttributeKey, AttributeValue, Protocol) that extend TypedValue, and it interacts with multiple Java standard library classes including HashMap, HashSet, Iterator, Map, Objects, and Set. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
