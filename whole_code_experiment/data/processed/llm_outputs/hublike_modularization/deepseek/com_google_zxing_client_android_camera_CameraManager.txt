    "justification": "CameraManager has dependencies with many other abstractions: incoming dependencies from CaptureActivity, CaptureActivityHandler, ViewfinderView, and AmbientLightManager; outgoing dependencies to CameraConfigurationManager, PreviewCallback, AutoFocusManager, OpenCameraInterface, OpenCamera, and PlanarYUVLuminanceSource. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub in the camera subsystem."
