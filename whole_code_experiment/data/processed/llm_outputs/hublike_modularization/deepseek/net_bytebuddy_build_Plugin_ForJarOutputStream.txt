It has incoming dependencies from Plugin.Factory, Plugin.Engine, Plugin.WithPreprocessor, Plugin.WithInitialization, and their nested types. It has outgoing dependencies to ElementMatcher, TypeDescription, DynamicType.Builder, ClassFileLocator, ByteBuddy, TypeStrategy, PoolStrategy, ErrorHandler, Listener, Dispatcher, Source, Target, and many other types from the net.bytebuddy package and Java standard library. The interface serves as a central hub in the build plugin system, connecting numerous components."
