    "justification": "The Uncheck class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It has outgoing dependencies to IOBiConsumer, IOConsumer, IOIntConsumer, IOTriConsumer, IOBiFunction, IOFunction, IOQuadFunction, IOTriFunction, IOComparator, IOSupplier, IOBooleanSupplier, IOIntSupplier, IOLongSupplier, IORunnable, IOPredicate, and UncheckedIOException. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from IOBiConsumer, IORunnable, IOLongSupplier, IOSupplier, IOIntSupplier, IOBooleanSupplier, IOConsumer, IOIntConsumer, IOFunction, IOPredicate, IOComparator, IOTriConsumer, IOBiFunction, UncheckedIOIterator, UncheckedFilterReader, UncheckedBufferedReader, UncheckedFilterInputStream, UncheckedFilterWriter, UncheckedFilterOutputStream, and FileUtils. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
