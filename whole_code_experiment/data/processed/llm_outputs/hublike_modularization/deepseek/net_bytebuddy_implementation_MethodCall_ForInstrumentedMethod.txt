    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions including: Implementation.Composable, MethodLocator, TargetHandler, ArgumentLoader, MethodInvoker, TerminationHandler, Assigner, ByteCodeAppender, StackManipulation, TypeDescription, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, ParameterDescription, ElementMatcher, FieldLocator, InstrumentedType, MethodGraph, and numerous bytecode manipulation classes. It contains multiple nested interfaces and classes (MethodLocator, ArgumentLoader, TargetHandler, MethodInvoker, TerminationHandler) that further increase dependency complexity. The class imports 35+ different types and defines 5+ major internal component interfaces, making it a central hub in the bytecode generation system."
