{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 27 incoming dependencies (imports from other packages) and 15 outgoing dependencies (other classes that depend on it, such as CameraManager, CaptureActivityHandler, ViewfinderView, HistoryManager, BeepManager, AmbientLightManager, InactivityTimer, ScanFromWebPageManager, DecodeFormatManager, DecodeHintManager, IntentSource, Intents, DecodeThread, DecodeHandler, and ResultHandlerFactory). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub coordinating many different components of the barcode scanning system."
