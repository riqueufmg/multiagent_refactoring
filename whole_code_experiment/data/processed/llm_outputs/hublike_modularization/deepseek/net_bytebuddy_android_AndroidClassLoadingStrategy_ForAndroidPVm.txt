    "justification": "The class has numerous incoming dependencies (imports from android, com.android.dx, dalvik, net.bytebuddy, java.io, java.lang.reflect, java.util) and outgoing dependencies (abstract methods, inner classes, interfaces like DexProcessor and FileProcessor, and concrete implementations like Wrapping and Injecting). It acts as a central hub coordinating Android class loading, dex file processing, and multiple strategies."
