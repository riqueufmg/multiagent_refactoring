    "justification": "The class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: incoming dependencies from TypeReferenceAdjustment, OpenedClassReader, TypePool, ElementMatcher, and multiple ASM classes (ClassVisitor, AnnotationVisitor, FieldVisitor, MethodVisitor, RecordComponentVisitor, Type, Handle, ConstantDynamic, Label, TypePath); outgoing dependencies to TypeReferenceAdjustment, OpenedClassReader, TypePool, ElementMatcher, and ASM classes. It acts as a central hub for type reference collection and adjustment."
