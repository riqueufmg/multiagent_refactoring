    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class RemoveUnusedImports has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It imports 28 different classes/packages (including static imports) from various libraries (com.google.common, com.sun.source, com.sun.tools.javac, javax.tools, java.lang.reflect, java.util, org.jspecify). Additionally, it contains inner classes (UnusedImportScanner, DocTreeScanner, ReferenceScanner) that further increase its coupling. The class acts as a central hub coordinating parsing, scanning, and replacement operations for import removal."
