    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Main",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Main has incoming dependencies from UsageException (via super constructor call), CommandLineOptionsParser (via parse method), and FormatFileCallable (via constructor and Result class). It has outgoing dependencies to CommandLineOptions, JavaFormatterOptions, FormatFileCallable, ExecutorService, ExecutorCompletionService, PrintWriter, InputStream, Path, Files, and multiple Java standard library classes. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub coordinating many other abstractions."
