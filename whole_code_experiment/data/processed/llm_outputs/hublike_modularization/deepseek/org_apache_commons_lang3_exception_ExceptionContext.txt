    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The interface ExceptionContext has incoming dependencies from ContextedRuntimeException and ContextedException (both implement it), and outgoing dependencies to List, Set, and Pair (from method signatures). It serves as a central hub connecting multiple exception classes to data structures, with both incoming and outgoing dependencies to several other abstractions."
