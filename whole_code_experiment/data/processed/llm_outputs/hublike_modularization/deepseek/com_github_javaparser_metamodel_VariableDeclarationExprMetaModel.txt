    "justification": "JavaParserMetaModel has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It contains static references to 134 different meta-model classes (e.g., nodeMetaModel, bodyDeclarationMetaModel, expressionMetaModel, etc.), imports 3 classes, and is referenced by VariableDeclarationExpr and other AST node classes. The class acts as a central hub that aggregates and initializes all meta-model components in the system."
