    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.Injecting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Injecting class has dependencies on its parent class AndroidClassLoadingStrategy, DexProcessor, File, Set, Map, TypeDescription, and a few Android-specific classes (BaseDexClassLoader, DexFile). The total number of distinct incoming/outgoing dependencies is limited and does not indicate a hub-like structure with a large number of connections to many other abstractions."
