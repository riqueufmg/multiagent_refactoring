    "justification": "The class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it imports 28 different types (including java.io.*, java.nio.*, java.net.*, and org.apache.commons.io.* packages), defines 11 inner classes that each handle different origin types, and provides conversion methods between 12 different data types (byte[], CharSequence, File, Path, RandomAccessFile, InputStream, Reader, ReadableByteChannel, OutputStream, Writer, WritableByteChannel, URI). This central hub orchestrates conversions between numerous I/O abstractions."
