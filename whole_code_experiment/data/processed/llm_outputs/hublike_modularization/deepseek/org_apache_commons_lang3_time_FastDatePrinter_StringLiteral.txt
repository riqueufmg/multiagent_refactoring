    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The FastDatePrinter class acts as a central hub with dependencies to numerous other abstractions. It has incoming dependencies from external classes like FastDateFormat (factory), DatePrinter (interface), and various callers. It has outgoing dependencies to many internal nested classes (CharacterLiteral, StringLiteral, TextField, Iso8601_Rule, TimeZoneNameRule, TimeZoneNumberRule, PaddedNumberField, UnpaddedNumberField, TwoDigitNumberField, TwoDigitMonthField, TwoDigitYearField, UnpaddedMonthField, TwelveHourField, TwentyFourHourField, DayInWeekField, WeekYear, TimeZoneDisplayKey, Rule, NumberRule) and external classes (Calendar, Date, TimeZone, Locale, DateFormatSymbols, Appendable, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, IOException, ConcurrentMap, CharUtils, ClassUtils, LocaleUtils, ExceptionUtils, CalendarUtils). The large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it serves as a central coordination point, fitting the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
