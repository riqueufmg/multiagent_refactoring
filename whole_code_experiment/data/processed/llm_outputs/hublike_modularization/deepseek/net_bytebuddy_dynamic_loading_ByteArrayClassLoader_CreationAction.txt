    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It depends on numerous external classes (ClassFileVersion, TypeDescription, JavaModule, GraalImageCode, JavaDispatcher, various Java standard library classes) and has multiple inner classes/interfaces (SynchronizationStrategy, PackageLookupStrategy, PersistenceHandler, ChildFirst, etc.) that depend on it. It also has many constructor overloads and static factory methods that create dependencies with other components, making it a central hub in the dependency graph."
