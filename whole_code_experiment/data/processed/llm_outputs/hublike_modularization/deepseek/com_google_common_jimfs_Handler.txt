    "justification": "The Handler class has minimal dependencies: it extends URLStreamHandler, uses PathURLConnection, and interacts with basic Java classes (URL, URLConnection, InetAddress, System). It has only one outgoing dependency (PathURLConnection) and no incoming dependencies from other abstractions in the provided context, which does not meet the criteria of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
