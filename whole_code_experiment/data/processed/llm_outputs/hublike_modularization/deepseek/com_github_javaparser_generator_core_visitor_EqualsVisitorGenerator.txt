    "justification": "SourceRoot has numerous incoming dependencies (used by EqualsVisitorGenerator and other classes in the codebase) and outgoing dependencies (imports JavaParser, CompilationUnit, ParserConfiguration, ParseResult, Path, Files, List, Map, ConcurrentHashMap, ForkJoinPool, RecursiveAction, Function, Pattern, Charset, IOException, and many other classes). It acts as a central hub for file parsing operations with extensive coupling to multiple system and domain abstractions."
