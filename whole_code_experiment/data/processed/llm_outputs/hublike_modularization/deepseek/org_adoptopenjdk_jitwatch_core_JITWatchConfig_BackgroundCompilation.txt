    "justification": "The class has numerous incoming dependencies (imports from 8 different packages including java.io, java.util, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util, com.chrisnewland.freelogj) and outgoing dependencies (provides configuration data to many other components through its 50+ public getter/setter methods). It acts as a central configuration hub managing properties for source locations, class locations, compilation modes, UI settings, and sandbox configurations."
