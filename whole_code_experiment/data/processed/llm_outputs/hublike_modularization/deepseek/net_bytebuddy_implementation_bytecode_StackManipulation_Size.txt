    "justification": "The StackManipulation interface has numerous incoming dependencies (implementations: Illegal, Trivial, AbstractBase, Compound, Simple, Size) and outgoing dependencies (MethodVisitor, Implementation.Context, StackSize, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). It serves as a central hub for stack manipulation operations with multiple inner classes and interfaces depending on it, while it also depends on several external types."
