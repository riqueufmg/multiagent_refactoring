    "justification": "The TypeDescription interface has a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It extends TypeDefinition, ByteCodeElement, and TypeVariableSource, and contains numerous nested interfaces (Generic, Visitor, AnnotationReader, etc.) and inner classes (AbstractBase, ForLoadedType, ArrayProjection, etc.). It imports 58 other classes/packages and declares 5 static fields, 58 methods, and multiple nested types, making it a central hub in the type description system with extensive coupling."
