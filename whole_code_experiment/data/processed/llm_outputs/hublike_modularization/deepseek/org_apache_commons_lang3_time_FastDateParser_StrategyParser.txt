    "justification": "StrategyParser is a private inner class with limited dependencies. It only depends on its enclosing class FastDateParser (for pattern field), Calendar, CharUtils, Objects, and StringBuilder. It has few incoming dependencies (only used by FastDateParser.init()) and few outgoing dependencies, not meeting the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
