    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Decoder class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (BitMatrixParser, DataBlock, DecodedBitStreamParser) and 2 incoming dependencies (DataMatrixReader and its own constructor). This does not constitute a large number of dependencies in either direction, so it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
