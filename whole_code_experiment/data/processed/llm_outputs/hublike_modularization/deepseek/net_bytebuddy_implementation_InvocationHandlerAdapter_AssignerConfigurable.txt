    "justification": "The class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: incoming dependencies from Implementation.Composable, Implementation, ByteCodeAppender, Target, Context, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, FieldDescription, StackManipulation, Assigner, MethodConstant, FieldAccess, MethodInvocation, MethodVariableAccess, ArrayFactory, NullConstant, Removal, MethodReturn, FieldLocator, InstrumentedType, and outgoing dependencies to all these types plus InvocationHandler, List, ArrayList, MethodVisitor, Opcodes, RandomString, and various matchers. It acts as a central hub connecting many different components of the bytecode generation system."
