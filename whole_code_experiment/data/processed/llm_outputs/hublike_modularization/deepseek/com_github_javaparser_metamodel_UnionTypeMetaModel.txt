    "justification": "JavaParserMetaModel has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It contains static fields for 112 different MetaModel classes (e.g., nodeMetaModel, bodyDeclarationMetaModel, callableDeclarationMetaModel, etc.), initializes property meta models for all these classes in initializePropertyMetaModels() method, and maintains a list of all node meta models in nodeMetaModels. This makes it a central hub with both incoming and outgoing dependencies to virtually all other meta model classes in the system."
