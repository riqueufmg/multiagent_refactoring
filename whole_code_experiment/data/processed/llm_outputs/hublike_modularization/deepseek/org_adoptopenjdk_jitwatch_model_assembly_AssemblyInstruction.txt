    "detection": true,
    "justification": "AssemblyInstruction has incoming dependencies from AssemblyLabels, AbstractAssemblyParser, AssemblyParserX86, AssemblyParserARM, AssemblyBlock, ViewerAssembly, and AssemblyLabel. It has outgoing dependencies to StringUtil, AssemblyLabels, and uses multiple static imports from JITWatchConstants. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
