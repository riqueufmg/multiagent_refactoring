    "justification": "The class has a high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It depends on numerous external abstractions (ByteBuddy, ClassFileVersion, ClassVisitorFactory, AndroidDescriptor, BuildLogger, EntryPoint, Plugin, TypeDescription, ClassFileLocator, DynamicType, TypePool, Logger, BuildService, BuildServiceParameters, BuildServiceSpec, Action, GradleException, JavaVersion, Property, Closeable, ClassVisitor, File, URL, URLClassLoader, List, Collection, ArrayList) and is also depended upon by its nested classes (State, ConfigurationAction, Parameters). This creates a hub-like structure with many connections."
