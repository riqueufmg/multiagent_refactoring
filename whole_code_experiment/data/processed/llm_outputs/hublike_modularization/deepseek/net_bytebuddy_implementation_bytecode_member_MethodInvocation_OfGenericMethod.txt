    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it imports and uses TypeDescription, MethodDescription, Implementation, StackManipulation, JavaConstant, JavaType, TypeCasting, and interacts with multiple classes from the net.bytebuddy package. It also defines inner classes (OfGenericMethod, Invocation, HandleInvocation, HandleType) and interfaces (WithImplicitInvocationTargetType) that further increase coupling. The class serves as a central hub for method invocation logic, coordinating between various bytecode manipulation components."
