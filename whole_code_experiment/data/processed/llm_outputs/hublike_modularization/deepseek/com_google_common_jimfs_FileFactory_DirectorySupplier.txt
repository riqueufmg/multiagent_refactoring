    "justification": "The class has dependencies on a limited number of abstractions: HeapDisk, FileTimeSource, Directory, RegularFile, SymbolicLink, JimfsPath, and Supplier. It does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; it primarily creates and supplies file objects, acting as a focused factory rather than a hub."
