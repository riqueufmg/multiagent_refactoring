    "class": InnerClassDotExpressions.InnerClass,
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (from InnerClassDotExpressions.main) and 2 outgoing dependencies (to InnerClassContainer.InnerClass.InnerInnerClass and InnerClassContainer.InnerClass.InnerInnerClass.InnerInnerInnerClass). This does not constitute a large number of dependencies in either direction that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
