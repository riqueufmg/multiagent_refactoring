    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.NodeUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "NodeUtils has incoming dependencies from Node, Element, and Document classes (via method calls like NodeUtils.parser(), NodeUtils.outputSettings(), NodeUtils.stream(), NodeUtils.selectXpath()). It also has outgoing dependencies to Validate, W3CDom, Parser, HtmlTreeBuilder, Document, Node, NodeIterator, Spliterator, Stream, and StreamSupport classes. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub connecting many abstractions."
