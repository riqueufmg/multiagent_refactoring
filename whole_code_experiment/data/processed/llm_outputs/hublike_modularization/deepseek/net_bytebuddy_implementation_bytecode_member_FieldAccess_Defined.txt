    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.FieldAccess",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The FieldAccess enum has dependencies with only 8 other abstractions (EnumerationDescription, FieldDescription, FieldList, TypeDefinition, Implementation, StackManipulation, StackSize, TypeCasting) plus standard library imports. This is not a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization. The class has a focused responsibility of representing field access operations."
