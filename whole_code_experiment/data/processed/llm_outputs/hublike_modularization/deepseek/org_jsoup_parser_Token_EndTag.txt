    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Token class acts as a central hub with dependencies to many other abstractions. It has incoming dependencies from its inner classes (Doctype, Tag, StartTag, EndTag, Comment, Character, CData, XmlDecl, EOF) and outgoing dependencies to multiple external classes (TokenData, TreeBuilder, CharacterReader, Attributes, Range, Normalizer, Validate, ParseSettings, TokeniserState, Tokeniser). The class serves as a container for numerous token types and coordinates interactions between many different parser components."
