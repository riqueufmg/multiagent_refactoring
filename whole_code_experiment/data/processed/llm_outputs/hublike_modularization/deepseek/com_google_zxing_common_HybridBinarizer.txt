    "justification": "HybridBinarizer has limited dependencies: it extends GlobalHistogramBinarizer, uses LuminanceSource (incoming dependency via constructor), BitMatrix (outgoing dependency), and NotFoundException. The total number of distinct incoming/outgoing dependencies is small (approximately 4), which does not indicate a hub-like structure with a large number of connections."
