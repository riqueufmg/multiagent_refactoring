    "justification": "The JavaConstant interface and its inner classes (Simple, MethodType, MethodHandle, Dynamic) have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Incoming dependencies include: TypeDescription, TypeList, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, EnumerationDescription, TypePool, ClassFileLocator, StackManipulation, JavaDispatcher, ConstantValue, JavaType, and various ASM classes (ConstantDynamic, Handle, Type, Opcodes). Outgoing dependencies include: all the above plus IntegerConstant, LongConstant, FloatConstant, DoubleConstant, TextConstant, ClassConstant, JavaConstantValue, and numerous Java reflection types (Method, Constructor, Field). The abstraction acts as a central hub for constant representation with extensive bidirectional coupling."
