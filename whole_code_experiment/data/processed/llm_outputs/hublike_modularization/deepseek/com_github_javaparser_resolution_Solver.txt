    "justification": "The Solver interface has 14 method declarations with incoming dependencies from JavaParserFacade, TypeExtractor, and Context, and outgoing dependencies to SymbolReference, ResolvedValueDeclaration, ResolvedTypeDeclaration, Value, MethodUsage, ResolvedType, Node, Context, and Type. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub in the resolution system."
