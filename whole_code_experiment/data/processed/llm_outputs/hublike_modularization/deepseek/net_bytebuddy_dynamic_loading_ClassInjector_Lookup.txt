    "justification": "The ClassInjector interface has a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It contains multiple inner classes (AbstractBase, UsingReflection, UsingLookup, UsingUnsafe, UsingInstrumentation, UsingJna) that implement or extend it, creating incoming dependencies. It also has outgoing dependencies to numerous other abstractions including ClassLoader, ProtectionDomain, PackageDefinitionStrategy, TypeDescription, ClassFileLocator, JavaDispatcher, ByteBuddy, DynamicType, and many utility classes from the net.bytebuddy package. The interface serves as a central hub for class injection functionality with many implementation variants."
