    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: incoming dependencies (DifferenceElement, Reshuffled, Added, Kept, Removed, NodeText, TextElement, DifferenceElementCalculator, PeekingIterator, ArrayIterator) and outgoing dependencies (CsmElement, CsmMix, CsmToken, List, Map, HashMap, LinkedList, ArrayList, EnumMap, Iterator, Comparator, Optional). The total number of distinct dependency abstractions exceeds typical thresholds for hub-like modularization."
