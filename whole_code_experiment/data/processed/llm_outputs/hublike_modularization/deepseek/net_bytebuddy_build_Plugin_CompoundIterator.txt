    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Plugin interface has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It directly depends on 28 types from the net.bytebuddy package (ByteBuddy, ClassFileVersion, TypeDescription, ClassFileLocator, DynamicType, TypeResolutionStrategy, MethodNameTransformer, LoadedTypeInitializer, ElementMatcher, TypePool, CompoundList, QueueFactory, StreamDrainer, AlwaysNull, MaybeNull, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, EntryPoint) and 45 types from Java standard library (Closeable, IOException, InputStream, OutputStream, File, JarFile, Manifest, List, Map, Set, Iterator, Executor, Future, etc.). It also defines 12 nested interfaces/classes (WithPreprocessor, WithInitialization, Factory, Engine, NoOp, ForElementMatcher) that further increase its coupling. The interface serves as a central hub for the Byte Buddy build plugin system, coordinating transformations, error handling, source/target management, and plugin discovery."
