    "justification": "The AsmClassReader interface has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: incoming dependencies from AsmClassReader.Default, AsmClassReader.ForAsm, AsmClassReader.ForClassFileApi, OpenedClassReader, and outgoing dependencies to ClassFileVersion, AccessControllerPlugin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, JavaDispatcher, MaybeNull, GetSystemPropertyAction, Attribute, ClassReader, ClassVisitor, PrivilegedAction, Arrays, Collections, List, and Object. It serves as a central hub connecting multiple implementations and external dependencies."
