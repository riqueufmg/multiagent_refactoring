    "justification": "AstObserverAdapter has only 4 outgoing dependencies (Node, NodeList, ObservableProperty, and AstObserver interface it implements) and no incoming dependencies from other classes in the provided context. This does not meet the threshold for a large number of dependencies in both directions."
