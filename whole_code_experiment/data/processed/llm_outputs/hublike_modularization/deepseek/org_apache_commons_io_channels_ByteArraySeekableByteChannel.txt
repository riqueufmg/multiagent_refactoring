    "detection": true,
    "justification": "IOUtils has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it imports 45 classes from various packages (java.io, java.nio, java.net, java.util, etc.), uses multiple internal classes (ScratchBytes, ScratchChars), and interacts with numerous external classes through its method parameters and return types (InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer, URL, etc.). This extensive coupling makes it a central hub in the commons-io library."
