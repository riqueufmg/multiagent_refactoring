    "justification": "JavaParserMetaModel has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (over 100 meta model classes). It contains static fields referencing numerous meta model classes (e.g., stringLiteralExprMetaModel, nodeMetaModel, bodyDeclarationMetaModel, etc.), initializes them in static blocks, and maintains a list of all node meta models. Additionally, it has methods that operate on these many dependencies, making it a central hub in the metamodel package."
