    "detection": true,
    "justification": "FieldAccess has incoming dependencies from 7 classes (Implementation, StackManipulation, TypeDefinition, EnumerationDescription, FieldList, FieldDescription, StackSize) and outgoing dependencies to 8 classes (EnumerationDescription, FieldDescription, FieldList, Implementation, StackManipulation, StackSize, TypeDefinition, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). The total number of distinct dependency relationships (15) indicates hub-like modularization where this abstraction serves as a central connector between many other abstractions."
