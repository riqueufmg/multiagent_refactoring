    "justification": "The Wrapping class has limited dependencies: it extends AndroidClassLoadingStrategy, uses DexProcessor, File, RandomString, TypeDescription, Map, Set, DexClassLoader, and HashMap. It does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions."
