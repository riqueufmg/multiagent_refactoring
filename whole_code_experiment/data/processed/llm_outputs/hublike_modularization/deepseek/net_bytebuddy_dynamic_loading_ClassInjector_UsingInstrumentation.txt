    "justification": "The ClassInjector interface has a large number of dependencies with other abstractions. It has incoming dependencies from multiple classes (AccessControllerPlugin, JavaDispatcher, RandomString, ClassFileVersion, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) that import and use it. It also has outgoing dependencies to numerous other abstractions through its inner classes (UsingReflection, UsingLookup, UsingUnsafe, UsingInstrumentation, UsingJna) and their extensive use of external types from various packages including java.lang, java.lang.instrument, java.lang.reflect, java.security, sun.misc, jdk.internal.misc, com.sun.jna, and multiple Byte Buddy internal packages. The interface serves as a central hub with many incoming and outgoing connections."
