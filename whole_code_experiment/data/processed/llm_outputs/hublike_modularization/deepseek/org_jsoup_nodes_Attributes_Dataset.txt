    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Attributes class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It imports and uses classes from multiple packages including org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable, org.jsoup.internal.SharedConstants, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.parser.ParseSettings, and org.jsoup.nodes.Document.OutputSettings. It also has bidirectional relationships with the Attribute class, creates and returns Dataset inner class instances, and interacts with various Java collections and utility classes. This high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies qualifies it as a hub-like modularization."
