    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The ClassInjector interface has a large number of dependencies with other abstractions. It has incoming dependencies from multiple nested classes (AbstractBase, UsingReflection, UsingLookup, UsingUnsafe, UsingInstrumentation, UsingJna) and their inner classes. It also has outgoing dependencies to numerous external classes including ClassLoader, ProtectionDomain, TypeDescription, ClassFileLocator, PackageDefinitionStrategy, JavaModule, ByteBuddy, DynamicType, and many others from the Java standard library and ByteBuddy framework. The interface serves as a central hub coordinating multiple class injection strategies, resulting in high coupling with many other abstractions."
