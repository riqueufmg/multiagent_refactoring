    "justification": "JavaParserMetaModel has a large number of incoming dependencies (it is referenced by all AST node classes via getMetaModel() method, as seen in RecordPatternExpr) and outgoing dependencies (it contains static fields for all node meta models, initializes property meta models for all node types, and manages constructor parameters for all meta models). The class centralizes dependencies for the entire metamodel system, acting as a hub."
