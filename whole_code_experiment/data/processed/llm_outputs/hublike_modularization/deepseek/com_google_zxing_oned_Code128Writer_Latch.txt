    "justification": "The class has limited dependencies: it extends OneDimensionalCodeWriter, uses Code128Reader.CODE_PATTERNS array, and imports standard Java collections and ZXing types. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions. The internal MinimalEncoder class is self-contained within Code128Writer."
