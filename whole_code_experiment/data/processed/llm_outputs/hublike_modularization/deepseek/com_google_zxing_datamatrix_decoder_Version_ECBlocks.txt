    "justification": "The Version class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it contains two inner classes (ECBlocks and ECB), depends on FormatException from another package, and is instantiated 48 times within its own buildVersions() method. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from external callers through getVersionForDimensions() and outgoing dependencies through its constructor parameters and field types."
