    "justification": "The Indent class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It has incoming dependencies from JavaInputAstVisitor (which imports and uses Indent, Indent.Const, Indent.If), Doc (which uses Indent), Doc.Level (which uses Indent), Doc.Token (which uses Indent), Doc.Break (which uses Indent), OpenOp (which uses Indent), and OpsBuilder (which uses Indent.Const). It also has outgoing dependencies to Doc.Level and Doc.Break through its abstract definition and usage in conditional indentation logic. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
