    "justification": "The TypeList.Explicit class has limited dependencies: it extends TypeList.AbstractBase and uses basic Java types (List, Arrays, ArrayList). It does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions. The main complexity and dependencies are in the containing TypeList interface and its nested interfaces, not in the Explicit class itself."
