    "justification": "The class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: ResolvedMethodDeclaration, ResolvedType, TypeSolver, MethodUsage, ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedArrayType, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, LambdaArgumentTypePlaceholder, SymbolReference, FunctionalInterfaceLogic, MethodAmbiguityException, ResolvedMethodLikeDeclaration, ResolvedParameterDeclaration, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ResolvedTypeVariable, ResolvedPrimitiveType, and various context classes (MethodCallExprContext, LambdaExprContext, etc.). It acts as a central hub for method resolution logic, coordinating interactions between many different type and declaration abstractions."
