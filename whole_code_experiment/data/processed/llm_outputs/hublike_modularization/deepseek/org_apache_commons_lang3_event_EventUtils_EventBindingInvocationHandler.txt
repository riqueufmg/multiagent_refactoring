    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.event.EventUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The EventUtils class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (MethodUtils and java.lang.reflect.Proxy) and 0 incoming dependencies from other classes in the provided context. This low number of dependencies does not meet the threshold for Hub-like Modularization, which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with other abstractions."
