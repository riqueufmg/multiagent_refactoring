    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies (extends AbstractFutureProxy, implements UncheckedFuture) and 4 outgoing dependencies (UncheckedInterruptedException, UncheckedExecutionException, UncheckedTimeoutException, and the superclass method calls). This does not constitute a large number of dependencies in either direction."
