    "justification": "DirectoryProperty has incoming dependencies from ByteBuddyTaskConfiguration (which imports and uses it) and outgoing dependencies to Provider (which it extends) and Directory (its generic type). It also has outgoing dependencies to File (via getAsFile return type) and FileTree (via getAsFileTree return type). This interface acts as a central hub connecting multiple abstractions across different packages (org.gradle.api.file, org.gradle.api.provider, net.bytebuddy.build.gradle)."
