    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithActiveRecord",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class TypeWriter.WithActiveRecord has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It imports 68 classes from various packages, including net.bytebuddy.description.*, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.*, net.bytebuddy.implementation.*, net.bytebuddy.utility.*, org.objectweb.asm.*, and others. It also defines multiple nested interfaces (FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool) and classes (Default, ForInlining, ForCreation) that further increase its coupling. The class is central to the Byte Buddy library's type generation, coordinating field, method, and record component writing, annotation handling, and ASM integration, making it a hub with extensive incoming and outgoing dependencies."
