    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from AsmVisitorWrapper.AbstractBase, Plugin, and Plugin.Factory interfaces. It has outgoing dependencies to Renaming interface, ElementMatcher, TypeDescription, DynamicType.Builder, ClassFileLocator, ClassVisitor, Implementation.Context, TypePool, FieldList, MethodList, and multiple ASM and utility classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates Hub-like Modularization."
