    "detection": true,
    "justification": "TreeBuilder has incoming dependencies from classes like Parser, Tokeniser, CharacterReader, ParseErrorList, TagSet, and NodeVisitor. It has outgoing dependencies to classes like Document, Element, Node, Attributes, Tag, Token, ParseSettings, Range, and SharedConstants. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub in the parsing module."
