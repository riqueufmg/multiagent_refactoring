    "justification": "The LockVisitor class has incoming dependencies from multiple concrete visitor classes (ReadWriteLockVisitor, ReentrantLockVisitor, StampedLockVisitor) and their builders, and outgoing dependencies to numerous external types including Lock, ReadWriteLock, ReentrantLock, StampedLock, Supplier, AbstractSupplier, Failable, FailableConsumer, FailableFunction, and Suppliers. It serves as a central hub connecting various locking mechanisms with functional interfaces."
