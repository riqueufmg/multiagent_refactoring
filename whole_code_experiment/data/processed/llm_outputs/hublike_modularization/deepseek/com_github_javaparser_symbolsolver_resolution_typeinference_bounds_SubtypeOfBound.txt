    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SubtypeOfBound has limited dependencies: it extends Bound, uses ResolvedType, and interacts with TypeHelper and InferenceVariable. It has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ResolvedType, TypeHelper) and 1 incoming dependency (BoundSet). This does not constitute a large number of dependencies in both directions."
