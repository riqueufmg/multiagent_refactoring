    "justification": "The ThreadUtils class acts as a central hub with numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies. It contains multiple inner classes/interfaces (ThreadPredicate, ThreadGroupPredicate, AlwaysTruePredicate, NamePredicate, ThreadIdPredicate) that all depend on ThreadUtils. Additionally, ThreadUtils has outgoing dependencies to many external classes including Thread, ThreadGroup, Collection, Stream, Predicate, Function, Objects, DurationUtils, and Predicates. The class provides utility methods that serve as a central point for thread-related operations, connecting various thread-related abstractions."
