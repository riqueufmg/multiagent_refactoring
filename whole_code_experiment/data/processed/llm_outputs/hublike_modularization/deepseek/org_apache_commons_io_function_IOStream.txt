    "detection": true,
    "justification": "IOStream has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: incoming dependencies from IOStreams, IOStreamAdapter, Erase, and multiple IO functional interfaces (IOPredicate, IOConsumer, IOFunction, IOBinaryOperator, IOComparator, IOSupplier, IOBiConsumer, IOBiFunction, IOUnaryOperator). It also has outgoing dependencies to Stream, Optional, DoubleStream, IntStream, LongStream, Collector, and various java.util.function interfaces. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
