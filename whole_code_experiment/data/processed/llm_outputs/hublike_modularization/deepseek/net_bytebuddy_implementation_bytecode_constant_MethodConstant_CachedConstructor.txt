    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The CachedConstructor class has limited dependencies: it depends on TypeDescription, StackManipulation, Implementation.Context, MethodVisitor, and FieldAccess. It does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions. The class is a simple wrapper that delegates to FieldAccess for reading a cached field value."
