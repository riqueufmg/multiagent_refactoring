    "detection": true,
    "justification": "SourceRoot has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: incoming dependencies from ParseResult, JavaParser, ParserConfiguration, CompilationUnit, Log, CodeGenerationUtils, Utils, and multiple demo classes; outgoing dependencies to JavaParser, ParseResult, CompilationUnit, ParserConfiguration, Path, Files, ConcurrentHashMap, ForkJoinPool, RecursiveAction, Function, Pattern, and many other Java and JavaParser classes. It acts as a central hub for parsing operations, coordinating between file system access, parsing configuration, result caching, and parallel processing."
