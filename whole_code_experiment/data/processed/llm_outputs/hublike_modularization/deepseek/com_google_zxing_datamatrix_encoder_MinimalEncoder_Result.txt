    "justification": "The MinimalEncoder class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions including: MinimalEncoder.Mode enum, MinimalEncoder.Edge inner class, MinimalEncoder.Result inner class, MinimalEncoder.Input inner class, HighLevelEncoder, SymbolShapeHint, MinimalECIInput, Charset, StandardCharsets, ArrayList, List, and various primitive types. It serves as a central hub coordinating encoding logic across multiple modes (ASCII, C40, TEXT, X12, EDF, B256) and managing complex interactions between Edge, Result, and Input classes."
