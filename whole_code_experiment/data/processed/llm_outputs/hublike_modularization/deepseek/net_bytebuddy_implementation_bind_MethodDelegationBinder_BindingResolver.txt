    "justification": "The interface MethodDelegationBinder has a large number of dependencies with other abstractions. It contains multiple nested interfaces (Record, MethodInvoker, ParameterBinding, MethodBinding, BindingResolver, AmbiguityResolver, TerminationHandler) and classes (Processor, Builder.Build, Virtual, Anonymous, Unique, StreamWriting, Compound) that depend on it. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to numerous other classes such as MethodDescription, TypeDescription, Implementation.Target, StackManipulation, Assigner, MethodInvocation, and various annotation classes. The interface acts as a central hub coordinating method delegation binding with many interconnected components."
