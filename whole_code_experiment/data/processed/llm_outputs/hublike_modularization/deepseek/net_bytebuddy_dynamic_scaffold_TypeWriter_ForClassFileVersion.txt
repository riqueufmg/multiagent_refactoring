    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class TypeWriter.ForClassFileVersion (inner class of TypeWriter) has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It imports 58 classes from various packages (net.bytebuddy.*, org.objectweb.asm.*, java.*, javax.*) and defines multiple nested interfaces and classes (FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool, Default, ForInlining, ForCreation, etc.) that themselves have extensive dependencies. The class acts as a central hub for class file writing operations, coordinating field pools, method pools, record component pools, type validation, ASM visitors, and implementation contexts, resulting in high incoming and outgoing dependencies."
