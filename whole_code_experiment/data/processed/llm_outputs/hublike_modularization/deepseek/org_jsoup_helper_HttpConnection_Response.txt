    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The HttpConnection class has a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It implements the Connection interface and contains inner classes Request, Response, Base, and KeyVal. It imports numerous classes from various packages (org.jsoup.*, org.jsoup.internal.*, org.jsoup.nodes.*, org.jsoup.parser.*, java.io.*, java.net.*, java.nio.*, java.util.*, javax.net.ssl.*, etc.) and is referenced by other classes like RequestExecutor, AuthenticationHandler, and DataUtil. This high coupling with many abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
