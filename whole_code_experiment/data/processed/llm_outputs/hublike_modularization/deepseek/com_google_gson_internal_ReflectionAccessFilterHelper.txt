    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.ReflectionAccessFilterHelper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies (from ReflectionAccessFilter and ConstructorConstructor) and 2 outgoing dependencies (to ReflectionAccessFilter and JavaVersion). This small number of dependencies does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization, which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
