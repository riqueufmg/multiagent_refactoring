    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.SuperMethodCall",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The SuperMethodCall class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it implements Implementation.Composable, uses Target, InstrumentedType, ByteCodeAppender, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, MethodVisitor, Implementation.Context, MethodReturn, MethodVariableAccess, Removal, and contains inner classes WithoutReturn and Appender (which itself depends on TerminationHandler). This high number of both incoming (implemented interfaces) and outgoing dependencies qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
