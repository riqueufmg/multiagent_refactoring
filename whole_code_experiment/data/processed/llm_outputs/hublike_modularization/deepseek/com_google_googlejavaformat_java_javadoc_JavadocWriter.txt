    "justification": "JavadocWriter has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it imports and uses Token, Token.Type, JavadocFormatter, NestingCounter, and its own inner enums RequestedWhitespace and AutoIndent. It also has numerous outgoing dependencies through its many write methods that handle different Token types, and incoming dependencies from JavadocFormatter which calls its methods extensively."
