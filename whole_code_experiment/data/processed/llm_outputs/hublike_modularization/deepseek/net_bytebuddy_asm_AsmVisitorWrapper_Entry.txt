    "justification": "The interface has incoming dependencies from multiple classes (FieldDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation, ElementMatcher) and outgoing dependencies to numerous abstractions including ClassVisitor, FieldVisitor, MethodVisitor, TypeDescription, Implementation.Context, TypePool, FieldList, MethodList, and various nested classes (NoOp, AbstractBase, ForDeclaredFields, ForDeclaredMethods, Compound). It acts as a central hub coordinating ASM visitor functionality across the ByteBuddy framework."
