    "justification": "AbstractOrigin has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it imports 28 different types (including InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer, Channel, File, Path, URI, etc.), contains 12 inner classes (ByteArrayOrigin, CharSequenceOrigin, FileOrigin, etc.) that each handle specific origin types, and provides conversion methods between all these different abstractions, making it a central hub for I/O type conversions."
