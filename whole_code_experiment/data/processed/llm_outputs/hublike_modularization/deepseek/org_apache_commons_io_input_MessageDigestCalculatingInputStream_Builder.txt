    "justification": "The Builder class has limited dependencies: it extends AbstractBuilder<Builder>, uses MessageDigest, NoSuchAlgorithmException, IllegalStateException, Arrays, and Objects. It has only 6 distinct dependency types, which is not a large number of dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
