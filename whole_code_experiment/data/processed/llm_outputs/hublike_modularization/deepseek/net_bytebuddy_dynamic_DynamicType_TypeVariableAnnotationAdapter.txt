    "justification": "The DynamicType interface has a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It imports 72 classes from various packages (net.bytebuddy.*, org.objectweb.asm, java.*, etc.) and defines numerous nested interfaces (Builder, Unloaded, Loaded) with extensive method signatures that reference many other abstractions. The interface serves as a central hub for dynamic type creation with dependencies across the entire Byte Buddy framework including type descriptions, method definitions, field definitions, annotations, bytecode manipulation, and class loading strategies."
