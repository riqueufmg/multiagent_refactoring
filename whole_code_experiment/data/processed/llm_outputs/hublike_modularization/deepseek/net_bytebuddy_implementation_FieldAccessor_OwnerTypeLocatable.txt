    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The FieldAccessor class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions including: FieldDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, FieldLocator, InstrumentedType, ByteCodeAppender, StackManipulation, Assigner, FieldAccess, MethodReturn, MethodVariableAccess, ConstantValue, JavaConstant, RandomString, and multiple nested interfaces and classes (FieldLocation, FieldNameExtractor, PropertyConfigurable, AssignerConfigurable, OwnerTypeLocatable, ForImplicitProperty, ForSetter). It acts as a central hub coordinating field access operations across the bytecode generation framework."
