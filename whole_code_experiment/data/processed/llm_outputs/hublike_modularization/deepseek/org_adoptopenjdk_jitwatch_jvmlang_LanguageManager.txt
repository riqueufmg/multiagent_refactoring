    "justification": "LanguageManager has incoming dependencies from Sandbox and SandboxStage, and outgoing dependencies to 14 different compiler and runtime classes (CompilerGroovy, CompilerJRuby, CompilerJava, CompilerJavaScript, CompilerKotlin, CompilerScala, RuntimeGroovy, RuntimeJRuby, RuntimeJava, RuntimeJavaScript, RuntimeKotlin, RuntimeScala), plus JITWatchConfig, ILogListener, and various constants. It acts as a central hub that connects to numerous abstractions for language-specific compilation and execution."
