    "justification": "The VariantAction class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it depends on Project, Configuration, ConcurrentMap, Variant, GradleException, ConfigurationConfigurationAction, TransformationDispatcher, ByteBuddyAndroidService, RuntimeClassPathResolver, ByteBuddyTransformationConfiguration, VariantConfigurationConfigurationAction, and interacts with multiple Gradle APIs (Artifacts, Instrumentation, TaskProvider, FileCollection). It also orchestrates dependencies between these components, acting as a central hub."
