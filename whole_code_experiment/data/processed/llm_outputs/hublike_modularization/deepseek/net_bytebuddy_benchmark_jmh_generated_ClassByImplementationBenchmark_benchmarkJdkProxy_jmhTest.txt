    "justification": "The class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it imports 25 different classes from multiple packages (java.util, java.util.concurrent, org.openjdk.jmh.annotations, org.openjdk.jmh.results, org.openjdk.jmh.infra, org.openjdk.jmh.util) and depends on ClassByImplementationBenchmark_jmhType. It also has outgoing dependencies through method calls to numerous JMH framework classes (Blackhole, InfraControl, RawResults, BenchmarkTaskResult, ThroughputResult, etc.) and incoming dependencies as it's a generated benchmark class likely called by JMH runners."
