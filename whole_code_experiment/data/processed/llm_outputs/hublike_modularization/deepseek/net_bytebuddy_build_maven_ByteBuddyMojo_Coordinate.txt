    "justification": "The ByteBuddyMojo class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Incoming dependencies include multiple Maven components (MavenProject, MojoExecution, RepositorySystem, BuildContext), Byte Buddy abstractions (Plugin, EntryPoint, ClassFileVersion, ClassFileLocator, MethodNameTransformer, ElementMatcher), and various utility classes. Outgoing dependencies include numerous inner classes (ForLifecycleTypes, ForExplicitLocations, ForDependencyFolder, Transformer, Coordinate, StalenessFilter, MavenBuildLogger, TransformationLogger) and external dependencies from Maven, Aether, and Byte Buddy libraries. The class acts as a central hub coordinating transformations across many different components."
