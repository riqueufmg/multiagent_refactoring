    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedArrayType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ResolvedArrayType has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ResolvedType and ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration) and 1 incoming dependency (from ArrayType). This is far below the threshold for hub-like modularization, which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
