    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ByQuadrantReader has only one outgoing dependency (to Reader interface via delegate) and one incoming dependency (from its constructor parameter). It uses BinaryBitmap, Result, and ResultPoint but these are parameter/return types, not direct dependencies. The class has a low number of dependencies and acts as a simple wrapper, not a hub."
