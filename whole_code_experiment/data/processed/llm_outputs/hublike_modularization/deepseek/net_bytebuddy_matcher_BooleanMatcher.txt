    "justification": "ElementMatchers has 85 incoming dependencies (used by 85 other classes/methods) and 2 outgoing dependencies (depends on BooleanMatcher and ElementMatcher). This high number of incoming dependencies (85) combined with outgoing dependencies qualifies it as a hub-like modularization smell."
