    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Report class has incoming dependencies from 8 other classes (AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker, MemberComparator, ScoreComparator, SuggestionWalker, InliningWalker, ViewerBytecode, EliminatedAllocationRowBean, OptimisedLockRowBean, SuggestionRowBean, InliningRowBean, LinkedBCICell, MemberTableCell) and outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes (IMetaMember and ReportType). This large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub in the system."
