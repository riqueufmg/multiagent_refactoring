    "justification": "The ByteBuddyAgent class acts as a central hub with dependencies to numerous other abstractions. It contains multiple nested interfaces (AttachmentProvider, ProcessProvider, AgentProvider, AttachmentTypeEvaluator) and enums that are tightly coupled to the main class. The class has 20+ public static methods that orchestrate interactions between these abstractions, and it imports 25+ external classes from various packages (java.io, java.lang.instrument, java.lang.reflect, java.net, java.security, java.util.jar, etc.), indicating high incoming and outgoing dependencies."
