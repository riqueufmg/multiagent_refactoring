    "justification": "The Safelist class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: it imports org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer, org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes, org.jsoup.nodes.Element, and uses java.util.HashMap, HashSet, Iterator, Map, Objects, Set. Additionally, it defines four inner classes (TagName, AttributeKey, AttributeValue, Protocol) that extend TypedValue, and interacts with these types throughout its methods. The class serves as a central configuration hub for HTML cleaning rules, managing multiple collections of these types and coordinating their interactions."
