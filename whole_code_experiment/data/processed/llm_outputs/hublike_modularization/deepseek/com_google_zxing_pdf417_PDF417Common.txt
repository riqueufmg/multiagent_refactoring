    "justification": "PDF417Common has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It is imported by PDF417Reader, BarcodeValue, DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn, PDF417ScanningDecoder, PDF417CodewordDecoder, DetectionResult, and ModulusGF (incoming dependencies). It also depends on MathUtils (outgoing dependency). The class contains public static constants and methods that are used extensively throughout the PDF417 decoding subsystem, making it a central hub."
