    "detection": true,
    "justification": "RandomAccessFileMode has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: incoming dependencies from PathUtils, AbstractOrigin.FileOrigin, AbstractOrigin.PathOrigin, and MagicNumberFileFilter; outgoing dependencies to IOConsumer, IOFunction, IORandomAccessFile, RandomAccessFile, File, Path, OpenOption, StandardOpenOption, and IOException. It acts as a central hub for file access mode operations across multiple packages."
