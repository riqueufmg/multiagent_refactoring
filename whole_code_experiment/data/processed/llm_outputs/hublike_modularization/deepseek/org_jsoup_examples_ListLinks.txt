{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Document",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Document has incoming dependencies from ListLinks, Jsoup, and Elements, and outgoing dependencies to Element, Connection, Jsoup, Validate, DataUtil, StringUtil, Parser, Tag, Elements, Evaluator, Selector, Charset, OutputSettings, QuirksMode, DocumentType, FormElement, XmlDeclaration, and Entities.EscapeMode. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
