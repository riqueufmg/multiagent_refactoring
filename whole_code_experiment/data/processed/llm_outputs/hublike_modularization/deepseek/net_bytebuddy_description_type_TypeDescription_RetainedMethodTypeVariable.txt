    "justification": "The TypeDescription interface has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions including TypeDefinition, ByteCodeElement, TypeVariableSource, FieldDescription, MethodDescription, RecordComponentDescription, AnnotationDescription, EnumerationDescription, PackageDescription, ModuleDescription, ClassFileVersion, and numerous nested interfaces and classes within its own hierarchy (Generic, AbstractBase, ForLoadedType, ArrayProjection, etc.). It also imports and references many external classes from java.lang.reflect, org.objectweb.asm, and other packages, demonstrating extensive incoming and outgoing dependencies."
