    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceZip",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SourceZip has only 4 direct dependencies (JavaParser, ParserConfiguration, ParseResult, and its own Callback interface). It has 2 incoming dependencies (from itself via Callback and from unspecified callers). This small number of dependencies does not meet the threshold for Hub-like Modularization."
