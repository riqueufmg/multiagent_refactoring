    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.NumberTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NumberTypeAdapter has only 2 incoming dependencies (Gson and ToNumberStrategy) and 2 outgoing dependencies (ToNumberStrategy and JsonReader). This does not constitute a large number of dependencies in either direction, so it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
