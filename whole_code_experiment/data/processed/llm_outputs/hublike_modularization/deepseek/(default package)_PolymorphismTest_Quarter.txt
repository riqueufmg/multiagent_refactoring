    "class": PolymorphismTest,
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class PolymorphismTest has incoming dependencies from its inner classes (Nickel, Dime, Quarter) and outgoing dependencies to those same classes. It also depends on and is depended upon by the Coin interface. This creates a hub with multiple bidirectional dependencies between the main class and several other abstractions."
