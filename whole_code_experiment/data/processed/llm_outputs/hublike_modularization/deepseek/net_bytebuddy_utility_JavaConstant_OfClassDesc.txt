    "justification": "The JavaConstant interface and its nested classes (Simple, MethodType, MethodHandle, Dynamic) have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Incoming dependencies include: ConstantValue, TypeDescription, TypeList, ClassFileLocator, TypePool, StackManipulation, ClassConstant, DoubleConstant, FloatConstant, IntegerConstant, JavaConstantValue, LongConstant, TextConstant, JavaDispatcher, JavaType, ConstantDynamic, Handle, Opcodes, Type, Constructor, Field, Method, EnumerationDescription, FieldDescription, MethodDescription, and various utility classes. Outgoing dependencies are similarly extensive, covering all the types used in method parameters, return types, and field declarations throughout the large class structure."
