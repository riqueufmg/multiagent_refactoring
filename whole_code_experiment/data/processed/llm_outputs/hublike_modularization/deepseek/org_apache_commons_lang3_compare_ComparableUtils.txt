    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.compare.ComparableUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal dependencies: only one external class (ObjectUtils) and one standard library interface (Predicate). It has a single inner class (ComparableCheckBuilder) with which it has a natural parent-child relationship. The number of distinct dependencies is small, and the class serves a focused purpose of providing comparison utilities without acting as a hub connecting many unrelated abstractions."
