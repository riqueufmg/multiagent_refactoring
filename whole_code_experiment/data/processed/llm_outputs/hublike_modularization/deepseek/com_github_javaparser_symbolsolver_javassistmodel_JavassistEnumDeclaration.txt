    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has numerous incoming dependencies (it implements ResolvedEnumDeclaration, MethodResolutionCapability, MethodUsageResolutionCapability, SymbolResolutionCapability, and extends AbstractTypeDeclaration) and outgoing dependencies (it imports and uses many other abstractions including TypeSolver, Context, MethodUsage, ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedType, SymbolReference, JavassistUtils, JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter, JavassistFactory, and various Resolved*Declaration interfaces). It acts as a central hub connecting multiple abstractions in the system."
