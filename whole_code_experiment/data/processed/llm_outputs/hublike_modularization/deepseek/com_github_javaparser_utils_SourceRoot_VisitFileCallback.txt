    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The SourceRoot class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Incoming dependencies include usage by its inner classes (Callback, ParallelParse) and potentially external callers. Outgoing dependencies include imports of JavaParser, ParseProblemException, ParseResult, ParserConfiguration, CompilationUnit, DefaultPrettyPrinter, and numerous java.nio and java.util classes (Files, Path, ConcurrentHashMap, ForkJoinPool, etc.). It also depends on utility classes like Log and CodeGenerationUtils. The class acts as a central hub for file parsing operations, coordinating between file system access, parsing logic, configuration, caching, and parallel execution."
