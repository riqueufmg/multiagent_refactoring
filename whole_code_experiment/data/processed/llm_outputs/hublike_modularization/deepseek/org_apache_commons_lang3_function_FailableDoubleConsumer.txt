    "justification": "The Failable class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It has incoming dependencies from multiple Failable* functional interfaces (FailableDoubleConsumer, FailableIntConsumer, FailableLongConsumer, FailableBiConsumer, FailableConsumer, FailableBiFunction, FailableFunction, FailableDoubleBinaryOperator, FailableBiPredicate, FailablePredicate, FailableCallable, FailableRunnable, FailableSupplier, FailableBooleanSupplier, FailableDoubleSupplier, FailableIntSupplier, FailableLongSupplier, FailableShortSupplier) and outgoing dependencies to numerous standard Java functional interfaces (BiConsumer, BiFunction, BiPredicate, Callable, Consumer, Function, Predicate, Runnable, Supplier) as well as other utility classes (Objects, ExceptionUtils, Streams). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
