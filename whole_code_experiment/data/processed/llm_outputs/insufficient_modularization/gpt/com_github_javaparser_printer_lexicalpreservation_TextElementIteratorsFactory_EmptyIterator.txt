        "The EmptyIterator class is minimal and single-purpose: it implements Iterator<E> with hasNext() returning false and next() throwing an exception. It has no fields and no additional responsibilities.",
        "Related iterator behaviors are split into separate nested classes (CascadingIterator, SingleElementIterator, ComposedIterator) and factory methods (reverseIterator, partialReverseIterator), indicating responsibilities are decomposed rather than concentrated.",
        "There is no evidence of a bloated interface, excessive size, or multiple unrelated responsibilities in this class, so it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
