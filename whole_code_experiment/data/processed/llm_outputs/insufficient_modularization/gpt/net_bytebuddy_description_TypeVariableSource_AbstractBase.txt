    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it implements only type-variable resolution behavior (findVariable and findExpectedVariable) and declares a single abstract helper (toSafeString). It delegates work to getTypeVariables().filter(...), getEnclosingSource(), and TypeDescription.Generic, and throws a specific IllegalArgumentException when resolution fails. It does not contain unrelated responsibilities, large fused logic, or a bloated interface; instead it provides a focused shared implementation for the TypeVariableSource abstraction. Therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
