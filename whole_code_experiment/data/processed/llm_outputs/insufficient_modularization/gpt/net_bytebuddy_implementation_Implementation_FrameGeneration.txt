    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The enum is cohesive and focused on a single responsibility: generating and writing stack map frames. It defines three closely related strategies (GENERATE, EXPAND, DISABLED) that each implement the abstract generate(...) behavior and exposes related convenience methods (same, same1, append, chop, full). The auxiliary static helpers (toStackMapFrames, toStackMapFrame) and the EMPTY/active fields are directly tied to frame generation logic. There are no unrelated responsibilities (no field caching, accessor or auxiliary-type management) mixed into this type, and its size and complexity are appropriate for the functionality it provides."
