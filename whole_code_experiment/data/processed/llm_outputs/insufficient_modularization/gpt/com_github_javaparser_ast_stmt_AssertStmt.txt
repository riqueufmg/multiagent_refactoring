    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The AssertStmt class is small and cohesive: it models a single language construct (an assert statement) with only two fields (check and optional message). Its methods are standard AST-node operations (constructors, getters/setters, visitor acceptors, clone, remove/replace, type-casting helpers) and are marked as generated, indicating they follow the common node pattern rather than containing unrelated responsibilities. There is no evidence of a bloated interface, excessive size, or unrelated functionality concentrated in this class, and its responsibilities are narrowly focused and appropriate for its abstraction."
