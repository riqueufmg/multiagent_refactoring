    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "MemberSubstitution.Source",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The enum MemberSubstitution.Source encapsulates a single, well-defined responsibility: resolving the source of values for substitutions (representation of 'this', arguments, argument lists, method handles and origin representations). Its cases (SUBSTITUTED_ELEMENT, ENCLOSING_METHOD) and methods (self, argument, arguments, handle, isRepresentable, resolve) plus the small nested Value class are cohesive and narrowly focused on that concern. There is no evidence of unrelated responsibilities, bloated public API, or multiple orthogonal roles within this class, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
