    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AccessibleScanner is a minimal, single-purpose adapter: it only declares a protected constructor that delegates to super (protected AccessibleScanner(ScannerFactory fac, JavaTokenizer tokenizer) { super(fac, tokenizer); }) and defines no fields or additional methods. It does not contain a large API, multiple responsibilities, or excessive internal logic; instead it exists solely to expose Scanner's protected constructor. Therefore it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
