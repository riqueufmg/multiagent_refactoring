    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeList.Empty is small and cohesive: it implements only three trivial methods (toInternalNames returning NO_INTERFACES, getStackSize returning 0, and asGenericTypes returning new Generic.Empty()). It extends FilterableList.Empty and encapsulates the single responsibility of representing an empty type list. There is no evidence of bloated interface, multiple unrelated responsibilities, or excessive complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
