    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Java16Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: it extends Java15Validator and its sole constructor adjusts a few validation rules (remove(noPatternMatchingInstanceOf), remove(noRecordDeclaration), remove(innerClasses), add(recordAsTypeIdentifierNotAllowed), add(recordDeclarationValidator)). There are no large methods, no many fields, and no concentration of unrelated responsibilities; it delegates actual validation behavior to the superclass and to added/removed validators. Therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in this class."
