        "NodeList is small and focused: it encapsulates a single List<? extends Node> and exposes minimal list operations (get, size) plus a wrap method and asMethodList conversion.",
        "The class has a single responsibility (representing and adapting a list of MethodGraph.Node instances) and does not contain unrelated functionality such as graph compilation, merging, or visibility logic found elsewhere in the enclosing type.",
        "There are no signs of excessive fields, complex branching, or a bloated interface: only one private field and four simple methods, indicating good cohesion and modularity.",
        "NodeList leverages FilterableList.AbstractBase for list behavior, showing appropriate decomposition rather than consolidating additional behavior into this class."
