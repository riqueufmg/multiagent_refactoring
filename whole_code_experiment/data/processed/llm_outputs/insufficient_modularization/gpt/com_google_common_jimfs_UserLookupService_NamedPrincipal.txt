    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NamedPrincipal is small and cohesive: it contains a single final field (name) and three simple final methods (getName, hashCode, toString). Responsibilities are appropriately separated — the two concrete nested classes (JimfsUserPrincipal and JimfsGroupPrincipal) only implement type-specific equals logic, and factory methods for creating principals are provided on the outer class. There is no evidence of a large, bloated interface or concentrated unrelated responsibilities in NamedPrincipal, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
