    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NullWriter is a small, single-purpose class that cleanly implements the Writer contract by discarding all input. It contains no state (only a singleton INSTANCE and a deprecated alias), overrides Writer methods (write, append, flush, close) with trivial implementations, and delegates input validation to IOUtils. There is no sign of multiple responsibilities, bloated logic, or a large/unwieldy interface—the class is cohesive and minimal—so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
