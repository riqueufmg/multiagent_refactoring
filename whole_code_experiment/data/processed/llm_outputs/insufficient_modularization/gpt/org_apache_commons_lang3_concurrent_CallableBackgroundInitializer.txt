    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "CallableBackgroundInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: it has a single final field (callable), two constructors, a private null-check helper (checkCallable), an override getTypedException that wraps an Exception for typing, and initialize() that simply delegates to callable.call(). It concentrates one clear responsibility (adapting a Callable to BackgroundInitializer) and delegates execution and lifecycle concerns to the BackgroundInitializer superclass and any provided ExecutorService. There is no evidence of excessive size, multiple unrelated responsibilities, or a bloated interface, so insufficient modularization is not present."
