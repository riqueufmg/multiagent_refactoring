    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is cohesive and focused on a single responsibility: emulating a Reader of a given size. Its state is small and related (size, position, mark, readLimit, eof, and flags markSupported/throwEofException). Methods map directly to the Reader contract (read(), read(char[]...), skip(), mark(), reset(), close()) and there are clear, small helper/extension points (protected processChar/processChars and private doEndOfFile). There is no mixing of unrelated responsibilities, no large unrelated methods, and the implementation is modular enough to be extended via subclasses, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
