    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ByteCodeElement.Token.TokenList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TokenList is small and cohesive: it encapsulates a List<? extends S> tokens, provides two constructors, an accept(TypeDescription.Generic.Visitor) to transform contained tokens, and simple collection operations (wrap, get, size). It delegates type transformation to token.accept(visitor) and extends a collection base (FilterableList.AbstractBase) rather than combining unrelated responsibilities. There is no evidence of an excessive API surface, multiple unrelated responsibilities, or large complex logic that would indicate insufficient modularization."
