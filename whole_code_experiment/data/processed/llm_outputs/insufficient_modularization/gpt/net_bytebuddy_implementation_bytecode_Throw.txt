    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Throw",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Throw enum is a tiny, single-responsibility singleton that implements StackManipulation. It declares one INSTANCE, two trivial methods (isValid() returning true and apply(...) that emits a single ATHROW instruction via MethodVisitor and returns StackSize.SINGLE.toDecreasingSize()). There is no evidence of a bloated interface, multiple responsibilities, excessive size, or internal complexity that would warrant further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not present."
