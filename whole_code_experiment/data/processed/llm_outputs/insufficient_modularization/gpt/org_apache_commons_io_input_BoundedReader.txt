    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it has a single clear responsibility (limit characters read from an underlying Reader). Fields (target, charsRead, markedAt, readAheadLimit, maxCharsFromTargetReader) all relate to enforcing the bound. Methods are limited to the Reader contract (constructor, close, mark, read, read(char[],int,int), reset) and primarily delegate I/O to the underlying reader while managing counting/limits. There is no evidence of unrelated functionality, bloated interface, or excessive complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
