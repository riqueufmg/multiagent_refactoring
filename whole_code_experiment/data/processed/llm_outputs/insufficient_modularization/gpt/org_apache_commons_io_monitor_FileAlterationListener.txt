    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "FileAlterationListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed type is a focused listener interface that exposes a small, cohesive set of callbacks related to file-system alteration events: six methods for file/directory create/change/delete (onDirectoryChange, onDirectoryCreate, onDirectoryDelete, onFileChange, onFileCreate, onFileDelete) and two lifecycle methods (onStart, onStop). Each method has a single, specific parameter (File or FileAlterationObserver). There is no evidence of unrelated responsibilities, excessive size, or a bloated API; the interface groups related concerns (file/directory events and observer lifecycle) and is intended to be used with FileAlterationObserver. Therefore it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
