    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "TypeDescription.Generic.LazyProjection.OfMethodParameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: it stores only three fields (method, index, erasure) and implements a single cohesive responsibility — lazily resolving a method parameter's generic type. Its behavior is limited to resolve(), asErasure(), and getAnnotationReader(), delegating annotation resolution to a specialized AnnotationReader.Delegator. It does not contain unrelated functionality, large conditionals, or a bloated public API, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
