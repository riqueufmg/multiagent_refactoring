        "The class is small and focused on a single responsibility: releasing direct ByteBuffer memory.",
        "Platform-specific behaviors are separated into a Cleaner interface with two private static inner implementations (Java8Cleaner and Java9Cleaner), showing clear modularization of version-specific logic.",
        "Public API surface is minimal (static clean(ByteBuffer) and isSupported()) and initialization is encapsulated in getCleaner(), so there is no bloated interface or mixed responsibilities.",
        "No excessive methods, fields, or unrelated concerns that would indicate the class should be decomposed further."
