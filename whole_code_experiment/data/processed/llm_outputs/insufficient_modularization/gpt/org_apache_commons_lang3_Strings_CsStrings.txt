    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CsStrings is a small, focused private static nested class that only implements case-sensitive behavior by overriding a limited set of methods (compare, contains, equals(CharSequence,CharSequence), equals(String,String), indexOf(CharSequence,CharSequence,int), lastIndexOf(CharSequence,CharSequence,int)). It delegates heavy lifting to utilities (CharSequenceUtils, StringUtils) and does not accumulate unrelated responsibilities or a bloated interface. Its scope is cohesive (case-sensitive string operations) and low in complexity and size, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
