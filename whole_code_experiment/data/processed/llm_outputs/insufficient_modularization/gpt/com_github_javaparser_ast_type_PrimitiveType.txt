        "The class is small and focused on a single abstraction: representing primitive types in the AST.",
        "Related functionality (boxing, descriptors, lookup by name) is encapsulated in the nested enum Primitive, which is cohesive and appropriate for this class.",
        "Static factory methods (booleanType, intType, etc.), the unboxMap, and Primitive.lookup methods are convenience and lookup utilities directly related to primitive-type behavior, not unrelated responsibilities.",
        "AST-related operations (annotations handling, visitor acceptors, cloning, meta-model access, resolution and conversion to usage) are consistent with the role of a Type node and are expected concerns inherited or required by the framework.",
        "There are few instance fields (only 'type') and no signs of a bloated interface or unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient decomposition."
