    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CastExpr is a small, cohesive AST node focused solely on representing a type cast. It has only two primary fields (type, expression) with corresponding getters/setters (getType/setType, getExpression/setExpression), simple constructors, visitor acceptors (accept for GenericVisitor and VoidVisitor), clone(), replace(), and type-query helpers (isCastExpr, asCastExpr, ifCastExpr, toCastExpr). Behavior is delegated to visitors (CloneVisitor, GenericVisitor/VoidVisitor) and it implements NodeWithType and NodeWithExpression interfaces, so responsibilities are well-scoped and not bloated. There are no large methods combining unrelated concerns or excessive fields that would indicate insufficient decomposition."
