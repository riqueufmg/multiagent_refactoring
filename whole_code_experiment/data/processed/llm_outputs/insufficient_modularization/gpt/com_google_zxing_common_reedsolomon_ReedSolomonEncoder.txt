    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ReedSolomonEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ReedSolomonEncoder is small and cohesive: it has only two fields (field, cachedGenerators), a constructor, one public method (encode) and one private helper (buildGenerator). Polynomial arithmetic is delegated to GenericGFPoly and GenericGF, showing clear separation of concerns. The class encapsulates caching of generator polynomials and encoding logic only, with no unrelated responsibilities or a bloated public API. Therefore it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
