    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed type is a small, single-responsibility interface with one method (assignUnboxedTo). Its behavior is cleanly decomposed: explicit cases are handled by the nested ExplicitlyTypedUnboxingResponsible enum and implicit cases by the nested ImplicitlyTypedUnboxingResponsible class. The PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate enum contains the mapping/unboxing mechanics while UnboxingResponsible only defines the contract for performing an unboxing assignment. There is no excessive size, bloated interface, or concentrated unrelated responsibilities in this interface or its small implementations."
