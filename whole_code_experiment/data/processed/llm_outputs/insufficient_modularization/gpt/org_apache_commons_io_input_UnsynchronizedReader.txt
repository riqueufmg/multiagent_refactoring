    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": ["UnsynchronizedReader"],
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it contains only three private fields (closed, skipBuffer, MAX_SKIP_BUFFER_SIZE) and a focused set of methods (constructor, checkOpen, close, isClosed, setClosed, skip). All members relate to a single responsibility — providing an unsynchronized Reader implementation and managing its open/closed state and skip behavior. There are no large/mixed responsibilities, no bloated interface, and the longest method (skip) is self-contained and narrowly scoped (buffer allocation and looped read). Therefore it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
