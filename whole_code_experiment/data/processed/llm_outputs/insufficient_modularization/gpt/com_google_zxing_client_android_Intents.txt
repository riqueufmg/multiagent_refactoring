    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Intents",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a small, final utility holder that only defines related public static constants. It groups constants into focused nested static classes (Scan, Encode, History, SearchBookContents, WifiConnect, Share), each representing a single intent-related concern. There are no large methods, no mixed responsibilities, and private constructors prevent instantiation. Responsibilities are cohesive and already modularized, so the Insufficient Modularization smell is not present."
