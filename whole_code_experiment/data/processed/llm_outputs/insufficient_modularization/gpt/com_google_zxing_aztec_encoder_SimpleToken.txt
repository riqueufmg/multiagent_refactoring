        "Methods and fields are cohesive and directly related to the token's responsibility (encoding bits into a BitArray and producing a binary string representation).",
        "It cleanly extends Token and delegates prior chaining to the superclass via super(previous), indicating proper decomposition in the token hierarchy rather than concentrating unrelated responsibilities here.",
        "No signs of excessive size, large public interface, or multiple unrelated responsibilities that would indicate a need to split the class further."
