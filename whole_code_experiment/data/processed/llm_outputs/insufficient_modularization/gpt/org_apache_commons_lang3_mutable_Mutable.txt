        "The interface is minimal and cohesive: it defines a single abstraction (mutable access to a value) via get()/getValue() and setValue(T).",
        "Only three API elements exist: default T get() (delegates to getValue()), deprecated T getValue(), and void setValue(T) — no bloated interface or unrelated responsibilities.",
        "The default get() method is a small compatibility convenience and reduces duplication; extending Supplier<T> integrates with JDK functional types rather than adding unrelated functionality.",
        "The generic type parameter <T> keeps the abstraction focused and reusable across types, indicating good modularization rather than a monolithic class."
