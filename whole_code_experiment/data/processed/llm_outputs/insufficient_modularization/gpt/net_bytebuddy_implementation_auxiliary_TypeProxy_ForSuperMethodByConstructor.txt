    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: it has only five instance fields, a constructor, and a single apply(MethodVisitor, Implementation.Context) method. Its sole responsibility is creating and initializing a proxy instance by invoking a chosen constructor and writing the proxy into a field. Complex behavior is delegated to other types (TypeProxy, DefaultValue, MethodInvocation, Implementation.Context), and there is no evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities, a bloated interface, or excessive size/complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
