    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ConstructorResolutionLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class concentrates multiple distinct responsibilities and contains large, complex methods that indicate insufficient decomposition: (1) The isApplicable(...) method is long and mixes variadic-argument normalization, type-parameter substitution, wildcard-tolerance handling, and assignability checks in deeply nested logic — it is a clear sign of multiple concerns in one routine. (2) groupVariadicParamValues(...) and the TODO-bearing findCommonType(...) implement argument normalization logic that could be factored into a dedicated parameter-normalization helper. (3) findMostApplicable(...) implements selection/ambiguity-resolution logic (specificity comparison, exact-match preference, and throws MethodAmbiguityException) which is a separate concern from type/assignability checks and could be separated into a comparator/selector component. (4) The method performs repeated patterns of type-parameter replacement and assignability testing (calls into MethodResolutionLogic repeatedly and also performs local matching via matchedParameters map), suggesting extractable sub-operations (type substitution, matching strategy, wildcard-tolerance strategy). These elements (large monolithic methods, mixed responsibilities, TODO stub, repeated logic) justify that the class is insufficiently modular and would benefit from splitting into smaller, cohesive classes/functions (e.g., VariadicNormalizer, TypeMatcher, ApplicabilityChecker, MostSpecificSelector)."
