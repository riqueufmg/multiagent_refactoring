    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class represents a single clear abstraction: metadata for AST Node types. Its state (type, name, packageName, isAbstract, hasWildcard, lists of declared/derived properties and constructorParameters, and optional superNodeMetaModel) and its methods (accessors, getAllPropertyMetaModels, isInstanceOfMetaModel, name/type helpers, and construct which uses the stored constructorParameters) are all tightly related to that abstraction. The implementation size is moderate, methods are cohesive (e.g., getAllPropertyMetaModels walks the meta-model hierarchy; construct uses constructorParameters to instantiate a Node), and the public surface is focused on metadata access and node construction based on that metadata. There is no evidence of unrelated responsibilities, excessive complexity, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient decomposition."
