    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Configuration class aggregates many distinct responsibilities and configuration domains in a single large class rather than decomposing them: it contains separate path configuration (pathType, nameDisplayNormalization, nameCanonicalNormalization, pathEqualityUsesCanonicalForm), disk configuration (blockSize, maxSize, maxCacheSize), attribute configuration (attributeViews, attributeProviders, defaultAttributeValues, fileTimeSource), watch-service configuration (watchServiceConfig), and other concerns (roots, workingDirectory, supportedFeatures, displayName). Its nested Builder is large and performs multiple kinds of validation and logic (normalization checks via checkNormalizations and checkNormalizationNotSet, ATTRIBUTE_PATTERN and defaultAttributeValues management in setDefaultAttributeValue, path parsing/validation in setRoots and setWorkingDirectory, many setters across unrelated areas). In addition, the class includes platform-default factory logic and static holder classes (UnixHolder, OsxHolder, WindowsHolder, forCurrentPlatform) that mix creation/selection responsibilities into the same class. These facts (many unrelated fields, long builder with varied validation/logic, and platform factory logic) indicate the class is doing too much and would benefit from splitting into smaller, cohesive components (e.g., PathConfig, DiskConfig, AttributeConfig, WatchServiceConfig, and a smaller composing builder)."
