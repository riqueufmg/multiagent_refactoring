    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is minimal and focused: it contains a single constructor that delegates to its superclass with a fixed set of parameters, has no additional fields or methods, and represents a single, narrow responsibility (the meta-model for StringLiteralExpr). It is generated code (annotated with @Generated) intended to be a small, specific part of a larger metamodel and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. Therefore it does not show Insufficient Modularization."
