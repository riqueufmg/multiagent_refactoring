    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it models a single AST concept (an 'opens' directive) with two fields (name, moduleNames) and related node-management behavior. All methods (constructors, getName/setName, getModuleNames/setModuleNames, remove, replace, clone, visitor acceptors, type-casting helpers, getMetaModel) are directly related to maintaining or interacting with that AST node. There is no evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities, excessive size, or a bloated interface that would warrant decomposition. The presence of generated boilerplate (annotations like @Generated and repeated type-casting/accessor patterns) reflects consistent AST-node conventions rather than insufficient modularization."
