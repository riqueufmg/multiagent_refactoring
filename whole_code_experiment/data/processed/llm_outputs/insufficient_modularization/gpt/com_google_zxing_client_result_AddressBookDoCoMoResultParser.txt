    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "AddressBookDoCoMoResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "This class is small and cohesive: it implements a single responsibility (parsing MECARD entries). It exposes one main method parse(Result) and one small private helper parseName(String). It delegates detailed parsing work to AbstractDoCoMoResultParser helper methods (getMassagedText, matchDoCoMoPrefixedField, matchSingleDoCoMoPrefixedField) and merely assembles an AddressBookParsedResult. There is no large interface, no many unrelated responsibilities, and no excessive size or complexity indicative of insufficient modularization."
