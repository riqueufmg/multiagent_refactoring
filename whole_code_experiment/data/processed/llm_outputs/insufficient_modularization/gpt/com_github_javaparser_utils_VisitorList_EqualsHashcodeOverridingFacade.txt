    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, focused responsibility: it is a List wrapper that overrides element equality/hashCode using provided visitor instances. It declares cohesive state (innerList, hashcodeVisitor, equalsVisitor) and most methods are straightforward delegations to innerList required by the List interface (add, get, remove, iterator, listIterator, toArray, etc.). The small private inner class EqualsHashcodeOverridingFacade encapsulates the equality/hashCode override logic and is tightly coupled to the outer class (uses the visitors), so there is no evidence of a bloated or mixed set of responsibilities. The number of methods is explained by the List contract rather than by unrelated functionality, so the class is adequately modularized."
