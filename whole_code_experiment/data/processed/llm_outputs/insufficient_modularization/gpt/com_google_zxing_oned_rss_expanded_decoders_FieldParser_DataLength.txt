    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The nested DataLength class is small, cohesive and has a single responsibility: represent whether a field length is fixed or variable and store the length. It exposes only two final fields (variable, length), a private constructor, and two clear static factory methods (fixed, variable). It does not contain unrelated responsibilities, large methods, or a bloated interface. While the enclosing FieldParser class contains extensive mapping and parsing logic, DataLength itself is well-modularized and appropriately encapsulated as a private static helper type."
