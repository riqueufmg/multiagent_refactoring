    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "BrokenReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive with a single responsibility: a Reader that always throws a configured exception. It contains a single field (exceptionSupplier), a few constructors, a private helper (rethrow) and overrides of Reader methods (close, mark, read, ready, reset, skip) that consistently delegate to rethrow(). There is no sign of multiple unrelated responsibilities, excessive size, or a bloated interface — the implemented methods are the minimum required to fulfill the Reader contract for this behavior. Therefore it does not demonstrate insufficient modularization."
