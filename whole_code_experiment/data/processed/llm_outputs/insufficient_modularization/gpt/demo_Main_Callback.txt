        "It has a single, well-defined responsibility (logging the found file and returning Result.SAVE) and is used only by Main.process, so it is appropriately encapsulated.",

        "There is no evidence of excessive size, a bloated interface, or multiple unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
