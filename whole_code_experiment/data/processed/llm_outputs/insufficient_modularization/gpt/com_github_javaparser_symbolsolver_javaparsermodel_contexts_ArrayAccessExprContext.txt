        "The class is small and focused: it only defines a constructor and a single method solveSymbolInParentContext which simply delegates to the superclass.",
        "Its purpose is a narrow specialization (context handling for ArrayAccessExpr) and it extends ExpressionContext<ArrayAccessExpr>, indicating appropriate decomposition in the package.",
        "There are no large methods, no many responsibilities, no bloated interface or fields: the class merely documents and enforces a specific behavior (preventing recursive parent-node access).",
        "Given its cohesion and minimal implementation, there is no evidence of excessive size or concentrated unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
