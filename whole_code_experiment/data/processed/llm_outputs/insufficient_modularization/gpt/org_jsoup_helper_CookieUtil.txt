        "All methods are small, static helpers focused on a single domain: cookie handling for HTTP connections (applying stored/request cookies to requests, storing response cookies, and parsing cookie strings).",
        "Methods map to closely related responsibilities: applyCookiesToRequest (compose Cookie/Cookie2 headers), requestCookieSet (build request cookie set), storeCookies (store to CookieManager and extract Set-Cookie headers), parseCookie (parse single Set-Cookie value), and asUri (URL->URI conversion used for cookie store lookups).",
        "The class has no instance state and a minimal, cohesive interface (only cookie-related constants and utilities), so responsibilities are not overly concentrated or unrelated.",
        "Methods are small and focused; there is no excessive size, complexity, or a bloated API that would indicate the need to split into multiple abstractions."
