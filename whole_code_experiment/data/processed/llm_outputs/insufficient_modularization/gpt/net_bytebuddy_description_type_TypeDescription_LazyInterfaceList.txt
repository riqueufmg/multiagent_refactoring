        "The source shown is part of a very large, monolithic TypeDescription type that consolidates many distinct responsibilities into a single file/type hierarchy: generic type modelling (TypeDescription.Generic and many nested kinds), signature generation/validation (SignatureVisitor/ForSignatureVisitor), annotation reading (AnnotationReader and many Delegator subclasses), reflection proxies/dispatchers (LazyProxy, JavaDispatcher usage, ForLoadedType.Dispatcher), builders and builders' visitors, array projection, class-loading projections (SuperTypeLoading and ClassLoadingTypeProjection), and many concrete implementations (ForLoadedType, ArrayProjection, Latent, ForPackageDescription, etc.).",
        "This concentration produces excessive size and complexity (dozens of nested classes and hundreds of methods across multiple concerns) and a bloated interface/implementation that mixes high-level abstractions with low-level JVM/reflection/class-loading logic.",
        "Many cohesive responsibilities could be separated (e.g., generic-type representation, annotation reading, loaded-type adaptation, class-loading helpers, signature handling and builders) into focused classes/modules. The presence of small utility/dispatcher classes alongside large core logic in the same type indicates inadequate decomposition and thus insufficient modularization."
