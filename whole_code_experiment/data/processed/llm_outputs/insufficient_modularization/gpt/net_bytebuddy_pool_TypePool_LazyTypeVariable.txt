    "justification": [
        "The analyzed class (LazyTypeVariable) is narrowly scoped and focused: it represents a formal type variable with lazy resolution of its bounds and annotations. Its fields (typePool, typeVariableSource, annotationTokens, boundaryAnnotationTokens, symbol, boundTypeTokens) all relate directly to that single responsibility.",
        "Its public behavior is small and cohesive (getUpperBounds, getTypeVariableSource, getSymbol, getDeclaredAnnotations) and it contains one tightly-related helper inner class (LazyBoundTokenList) that encapsulates bound-list behavior. There are no large methods, no unrelated concerns (parsing, IO, caching, or module handling), and it delegates complex tasks to other types already present in the package.",
        "Given its limited size, cohesive API, and single responsibility, there is no evidence of excessive size, bloated interface, or concentration of unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
