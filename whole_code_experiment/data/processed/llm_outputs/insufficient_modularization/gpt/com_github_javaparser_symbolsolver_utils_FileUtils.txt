    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": ["FileUtils"],
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class contains only two small, focused static helper methods (isValidPath and getParentPath) that operate on file path strings. It has no fields, no large or bloated public interface, and concentrates a single, cohesive responsibility (simple file-related utilities). There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or multiple unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
