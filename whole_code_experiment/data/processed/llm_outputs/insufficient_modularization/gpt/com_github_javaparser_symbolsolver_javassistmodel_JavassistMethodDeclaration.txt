    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "JavassistMethodDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: it wraps a javassist CtMethod and exposes a ResolvedMethodDeclaration view. Many responsibilities (parameter handling, type parameters, exceptions, return type resolution) are delegated to JavassistMethodLikeDeclarationAdapter, and conversion tasks use JavassistFactory. The class contains only simple delegations and a few trivially implemented queries (isStatic, isAbstract, isDefaultMethod, getName, toDescriptor). There is no evidence of a bloated interface, excessive logic, or multiple unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
