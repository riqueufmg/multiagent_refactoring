    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "BarcodeMetadata",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it holds only five related fields (columnCount, errorCorrectionLevel, rowCountUpperPart, rowCountLowerPart, rowCount), a constructor that initializes them, and simple getters. It represents a single, well-defined abstraction (barcode metadata), uses immutable final fields, and contains no unrelated responsibilities, large methods, or a bloated interface. Therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in this class."
