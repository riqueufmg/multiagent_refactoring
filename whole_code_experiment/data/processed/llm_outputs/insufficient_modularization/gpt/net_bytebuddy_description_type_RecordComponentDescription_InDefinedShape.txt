        "The abstraction is decomposed into focused nested types with clear responsibilities: AbstractBase provides shared behavior, ForLoadedRecordComponent handles reflection/priviliged access, Latent models synthetic/constructed components, TypeSubstituting handles type substitution, and Token encapsulates detached properties.",
        "Methods and fields are small and cohesive (e.g. getType, getAccessor, getActualName, getDeclaredAnnotations, getGenericSignature) and duplication is reduced via AbstractBase and nested interfaces (InGenericShape, InDefinedShape).",
        "Related functionality is colocated in the same API surface (record component descriptions) but separated into specific classes rather than merged into a single large class, avoiding a bloated interface or mixed responsibilities.",
        "Use of helper patterns (dispatchers, visitors, explicit token objects) further modularizes behavior instead of concentrating complexity in one class."
