    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "AccessControllerPlugin.WithoutProperty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The nested static class WithoutProperty is small and highly cohesive: it only provides a constructor and a single overridden method onAccessController that emits a constant true (mv.visitInsn(Opcodes.ICONST_1)) and returns a constant stack-size (return 1). It declares no fields, no large methods, and encapsulates a single, well-defined variant of Initializer behavior. Responsibilities are narrowly focused and appropriately decomposed via subclassing of Initializer, so there is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface indicating insufficient modularization."
