    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.Dialogs.Response",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed type is a small enum with only three constants (NO, YES, NEVER) and no additional fields or methods. It does not contain excessive size, complex logic, or a bloated interface. While the enclosing Dialogs outer class contains many dialog-related methods (which could be examined for modularization issues), the Dialogs.Response enum itself is cohesive and trivial, so it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
