    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ParameterList.OfLegacyVmMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: it holds three related fields (method, parameterType[], parameterAnnotationSource), constructs itself in a single constructor, and exposes only two straightforward behaviors (get(int) returning a delegated ParameterDescription.ForLoadedParameter.OfLegacyVmMethod, and size() returning parameterType.length). Responsibility is narrowly scoped to representing method parameters on legacy VMs and it delegates parameter details to ParameterDescription classes. It participates in a well-decomposed family of nested classes (ForLoadedExecutable, OfLegacyVmConstructor, OfMethod, etc.), indicating appropriate modularization rather than a bloated or multi-responsibility design."
