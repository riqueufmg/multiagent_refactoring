    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is cohesive and focused on a single responsibility: representing an annotation member in the AST. It only holds a small set of related fields (modifiers, type, name, defaultValue) and implements node/visitor/resolution interfaces that are appropriate for AST nodes; the many methods are generated property accessors, mutators, visitor/clone/replace/remove helpers and notification/parenting logic rather than unrelated functionality. There is no evidence of many unrelated responsibilities, large unrelated code blocks, or a bloated interface — the implemented interfaces and methods are directly relevant to the node role, so insufficient modularization is not present."
