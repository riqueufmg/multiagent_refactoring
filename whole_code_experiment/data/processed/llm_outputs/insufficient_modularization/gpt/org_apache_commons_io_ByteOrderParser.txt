        "The class is small and focused: it provides a single public static method parseByteOrder that maps String values to ByteOrder constants.",
        "There is a single responsibility (parsing a byte order string) with only two straightforward conditional branches and a clear exception for unsupported values — no large method, no many responsibilities to split.",
        "The class has no state, no fields, and a private constructor (utility final class), indicating intentional, cohesive utility behavior rather than a bloated abstraction.",
        "No large public API or excessive complexity that would warrant decomposition into smaller classes or modules."
