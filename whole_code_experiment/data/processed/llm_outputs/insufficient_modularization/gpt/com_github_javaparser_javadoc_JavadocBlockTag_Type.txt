    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class (the Type enum and its enclosing JavadocBlockTag) is small and cohesive. The Type enum encapsulates a single responsibility (representing tag kinds and mapping names to enum values) with only a keyword field, a constructor, hasName() and fromName() helper methods. The enclosing JavadocBlockTag class focuses on representing and parsing a Javadoc block tag (fields: type, content, name, tagName; constructors; a factory createParamBlockTag; getters; toText; equals/hashCode/toString). Parsing logic delegates to Utils.nextWord and JavadocDescription.parseText, showing separation of concerns. There is no excessive size, duplicated responsibilities, or a bloated interface that would indicate the need to split the class into additional abstractions."
