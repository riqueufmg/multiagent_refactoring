    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The interface is minimal and cohesive: it declares a single abstract method call() and is annotated @FunctionalInterface. It has no fields, no large or bloated API surface, and a single, well-defined responsibility (a callable that may throw a checked exception). The use of simple generics (R, E extends Throwable) keeps it flexible without adding unrelated responsibilities. Therefore it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
