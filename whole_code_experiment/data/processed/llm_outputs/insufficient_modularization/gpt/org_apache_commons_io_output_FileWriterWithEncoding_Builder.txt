        "Builder is small and focused: it contains only two configurable fields (append, charsetEncoder) and simple setters for them.",
        "Single responsibility: the class's sole purpose is to configure and build FileWriterWithEncoding instances (get() returns a new FileWriterWithEncoding(this)).",
        "Delegation to other abstractions: it extends AbstractStreamBuilder and uses AbstractOrigin for file lookup (checkOriginFile), so file handling and stream initialization are delegated elsewhere.",
        "No bloated interface or large methods: there are only a few short methods (constructor, checkOriginFile, get, getEncoder, setAppend, setCharsetEncoder) and no complex logic beyond a small validation in getEncoder().",
        "IO and resource cleanup logic is implemented in FileWriterWithEncoding.initWriter rather than in the Builder, indicating proper separation of responsibilities."
