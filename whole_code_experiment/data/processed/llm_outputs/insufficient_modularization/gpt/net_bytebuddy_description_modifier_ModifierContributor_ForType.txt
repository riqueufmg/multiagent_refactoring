        "ForType is a marker interface with a single constant (MASK) and no methods, indicating a very small, focused abstraction.",
        "It has a single, clear responsibility (representing modifiers applicable to types) and does not aggregate unrelated functionality.",
        "Related behaviors are factored into other nested interfaces (ForField, ForMethod, etc.) and the separate Resolver class, demonstrating appropriate decomposition.",
        "There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface in this class, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
