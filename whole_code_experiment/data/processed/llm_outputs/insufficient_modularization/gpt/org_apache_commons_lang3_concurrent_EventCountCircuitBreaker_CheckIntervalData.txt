    "justification": [
        "The class is a small, focused immutable data holder with only two fields (eventCount, checkIntervalStart), a constructor, simple getters, and a single increment(delta) helper. It encapsulates a single responsibility (holding interval data) and does not combine unrelated concerns.",
        "It is private static and used internally by EventCountCircuitBreaker, limiting its scope and exposure, which reduces modularization concerns.",
        "No large/complex methods, no bloated interface, and no evidence of mixed responsibilities or excessive size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
