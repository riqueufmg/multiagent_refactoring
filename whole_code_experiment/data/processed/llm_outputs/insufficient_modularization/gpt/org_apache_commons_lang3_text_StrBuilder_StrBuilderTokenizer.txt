    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrBuilder.StrBuilderTokenizer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The inner class is very small and focused: it only overrides getContent() and tokenize(char[], int, int) to delegate to StrTokenizer and to the enclosing StrBuilder (calling StrBuilder.this.toString(), StrBuilder.this.buffer, and StrBuilder.this.size()). It has no fields, minimal behavior, and a single clear responsibility (adapting StrTokenizer to read from the enclosing StrBuilder). There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface, so Insufficient Modularization is not present."
