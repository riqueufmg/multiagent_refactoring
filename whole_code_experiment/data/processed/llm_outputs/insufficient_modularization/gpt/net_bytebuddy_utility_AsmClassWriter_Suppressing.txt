        "The class is small and focused: it contains a single private final field (Factory delegate), a constructor, and four make(...) methods that delegate to the contained factory.",
        "All methods are simple delegations (make(int), make(int, AsmClassReader), make(int, TypePool), make(int, AsmClassReader, TypePool)) implementing a single responsibility: suppressing/forwarding classReader usage to the delegate.",
        "No large data structures, complex control flow, or unrelated responsibilities are present (no utility code mixed in, no long methods).",
        "The class documentation and name indicate a narrow purpose (a suppressing factory wrapper), demonstrating adequate decomposition rather than a bloated abstraction."
