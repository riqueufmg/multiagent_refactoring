        "The class has a single clear responsibility: parsing and validating VINs (parse method plus supporting validation/mapping helpers).",
        "All helper methods (checkChecksum, vinCharValue, vinPositionWeight, checkChar, modelYear, countryCode) are private static and directly related to VIN parsing, keeping the public surface small.",
        "The class size and complexity are modest; the logic is cohesive rather than a mix of unrelated concerns.",
        "While some helper logic (e.g., country/model-year mappings or checksum calculation) could be extracted for reuse or testing, extraction is a refinement rather than a necessity to address a modularization smell."
