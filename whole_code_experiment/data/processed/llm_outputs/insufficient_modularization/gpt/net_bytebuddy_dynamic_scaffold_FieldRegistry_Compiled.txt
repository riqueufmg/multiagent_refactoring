    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FieldRegistry.Compiled is a small, focused abstraction: it defines a single responsibility (the target(FieldDescription) contract) and contains a single trivial NoOp implementation (enum INSTANCE) that returns a Record.ForImplicitField. The substantial logic and state are implemented in separate classes (FieldRegistry.Default and FieldRegistry.Default.Compiled and their nested Entry classes), which handle entry storage, matching and binding. There are no large methods, many fields, or mixed responsibilities within FieldRegistry.Compiled itself, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
