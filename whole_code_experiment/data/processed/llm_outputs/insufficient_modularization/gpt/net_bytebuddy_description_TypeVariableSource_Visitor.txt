    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Visitor interface is small and cohesive (only onType and onMethod) with a simple NoOp enum implementation. The related TypeVariableSource abstraction keeps responsibilities grouped: accessor methods (getTypeVariables, getEnclosingSource, isInferrable, isGenerified), lookup helpers (findVariable, findExpectedVariable) and a shared AbstractBase that encapsulates common logic. There is no evidence of a bloated interface or multiple unrelated responsibilities concentrated in this class, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
