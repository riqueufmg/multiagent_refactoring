        "PatternStrategy is small and focused: it contains a single field (Pattern pattern) and a few related methods (createPattern, parse, isNumber, abstract setCalendar, toString).",
        "The class has a single clear responsibility — matching a regex against the input and delegating value handling via setCalendar — which indicates good cohesion rather than a bloated interface.",
        "No large methods, numerous unrelated fields, or mixed responsibilities are present within PatternStrategy; more complex behavior is delegated to subclasses and to surrounding classes (Strategy, StrategyAndWidth, StrategyParser), showing appropriate modularization."
