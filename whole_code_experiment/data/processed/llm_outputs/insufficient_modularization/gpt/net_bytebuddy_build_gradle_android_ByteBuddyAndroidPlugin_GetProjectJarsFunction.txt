        "The analyzed class is a tiny nested enum acting as a single-function adapter: it defines a single INSTANCE constant and one method invoke(...) that simply returns task.getInputJars().",
        "It has a single, well-defined responsibility (providing a function mapping a ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask to its input jars) and no additional fields, complex logic, or large interface surface.",
        "As a concise, single-purpose component (singleton function object) it demonstrates appropriate modularization rather than a bloated, under-decomposed abstraction."
