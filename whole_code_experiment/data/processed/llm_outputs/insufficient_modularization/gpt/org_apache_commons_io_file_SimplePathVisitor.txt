    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "SimplePathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: it contains a single meaningful field (visitFileFailedFunction), a single overridden method (visitFileFailed) that simply delegates to the injected function, and a compact nested AbstractBuilder that only configures that same function. There are no large methods, no mixing of multiple responsibilities, and the public API is minimal (constructors and the visitFileFailed override). These elements indicate the class is cohesive and not overly bloated, so it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
