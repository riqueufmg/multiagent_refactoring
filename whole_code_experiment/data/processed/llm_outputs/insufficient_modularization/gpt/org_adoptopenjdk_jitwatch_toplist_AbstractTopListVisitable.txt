        "Traversal is delegated to TreeVisitor.walkTree(model, this), so the class does not embed tree-walking logic and therefore avoids mixing unrelated responsibilities.",
        "Extension hooks (empty reset(), visitTag(...), and postProcess()) indicate designed points for subclassing rather than accumulating disparate responsibilities in one class.",
        "Sorting is a simple, localized operation (anonymous Comparator inside buildTopList()) and does not indicate excessive size or complexity warranting further decomposition.",
        "No large number of unrelated methods or many fields are present, and the class responsibilities (collecting scores and returning a sorted top list) are cohesive."
