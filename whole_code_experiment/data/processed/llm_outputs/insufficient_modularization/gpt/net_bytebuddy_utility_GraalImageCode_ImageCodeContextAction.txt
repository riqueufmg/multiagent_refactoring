    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The nested ImageCodeContextAction is small and cohesive: it is a single-value enum (INSTANCE) implementing PrivilegedAction<GraalImageCode> with one focused run() method. The run() method performs a single responsibility (inspecting JVM input arguments via reflection to detect the native-image agent) and returns either GraalImageCode.AGENT or GraalImageCode.NONE. There are no additional fields, no large or bloated public API, and low complexity (single loop and try/catch). These characteristics indicate the class is adequately modularized and does not suffer from insufficient modularization."
