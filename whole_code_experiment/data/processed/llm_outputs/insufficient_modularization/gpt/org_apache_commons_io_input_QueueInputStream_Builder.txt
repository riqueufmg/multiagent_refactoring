        "The Builder class is small and focused: it only holds two configuration fields (blockingQueue, timeout) and provides setters for them plus a get() method to build the QueueInputStream.",
        "Setter methods perform minimal, appropriate validation (non-negative timeout, null mapping for blockingQueue) and return the builder for chaining — no unrelated responsibilities are present.",
        "Construction logic is delegated to QueueInputStream (via get()), and the class extends AbstractStreamBuilder, indicating proper use of the builder abstraction rather than embedding extra functionality.",
        "There is no evidence of excessive size, bloated interface, or mixing of responsibilities that would indicate a need to decompose this class further."
