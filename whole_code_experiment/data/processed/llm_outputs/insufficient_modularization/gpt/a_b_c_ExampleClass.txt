    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ExampleClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is minimal and not a bloated abstraction: it declares a single field (protected final DataObjectFactory doFactory), a constructor (which sets doFactory = null), and one method (getDataObject) that simply delegates to doFactory.getDataObject(objectID). There are no many unrelated methods, no large state, and no large or complex interface that would indicate an insufficient decomposition. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
