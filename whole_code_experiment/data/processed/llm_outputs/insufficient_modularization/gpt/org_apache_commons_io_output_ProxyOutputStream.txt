    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ProxyOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is cohesive and focuses on a single responsibility: proxying an OutputStream and providing extension hooks. It delegates all I/O operations to the protected 'out' stream (constructor and setReference/unwrap), offers small protected hook methods (beforeWrite, afterWrite, handleIOException) for subclasses, and includes a minimal Builder inner class for construction. The additional writeRepeat convenience methods are small, related helpers and do not add unrelated responsibilities. There is no evidence of a bloated interface, excessive size, or mixing of unrelated concerns—so it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
