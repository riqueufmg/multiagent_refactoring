    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Streams",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Streams class is small and cohesive: its public API is limited to stream-related utilities (parse, write, writerForAppendable). Parsing/writing logic is delegated to JsonElementTypeAdapter.ADAPTER, and the Appendable-to-Writer adaptation is encapsulated in the private nested AppendableWriter and its CurrentWrite helper. The nested classes are private implementation details that support a single responsibility. There is no evidence of excessive size, a bloated public interface, or multiple unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
