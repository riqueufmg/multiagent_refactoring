    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ElisionTest is small and cohesive: it defines only two methods (the constructor and main) and no instance fields. The constructor contains a single, simple workflow (create a Vector<Long>, populate it in a loop, compute a sum in a loop, print the result). There is no large class interface, no mix of unrelated responsibilities, and no excessive size or complexity that would warrant decomposition. All state is local to the constructor (local variables: vector, sum, loop indices), so there is no evidence of a bloated class or multiple responsibilities requiring modularization."
