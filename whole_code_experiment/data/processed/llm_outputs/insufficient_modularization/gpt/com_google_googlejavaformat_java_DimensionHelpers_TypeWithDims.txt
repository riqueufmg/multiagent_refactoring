    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeWithDims is a small, cohesive value-holder with only two final fields (Tree node and ImmutableList<List<AnnotationTree>> dims) and a single constructor. It contains no additional methods, no broad responsibilities, and a minimal interface, so it is not excessively large or complex and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. (The more complex logic in the file is in the outer DimensionHelpers, but the nested TypeWithDims itself remains narrowly focused.)"
