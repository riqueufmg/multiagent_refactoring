    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "JavaToken.Kind",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although JavaToken.Kind contains a very large number of enum constants and a large generated valueOf switch, it represents a single cohesive abstraction (the set of token kinds). Its methods are few and focused (valueOf, isPrimitive, getKind) and are directly related to the enum's responsibility. The large size is due to the number of tokens (and generated code), not because the class mixes unrelated responsibilities or contains multiple orthogonal concerns, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
