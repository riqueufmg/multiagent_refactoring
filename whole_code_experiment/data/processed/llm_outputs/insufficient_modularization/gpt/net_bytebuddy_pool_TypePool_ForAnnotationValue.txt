    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ForAnnotationValue is small and cohesive: it declares two private final fields (typePool, annotationToken), a constructor, getSort() returning Sort.ANNOTATION, and a single doResolve() method that resolves the annotation token into an AnnotationValue. It has a single, well-defined responsibility (lazy resolution of an annotation value) and does not contain large unrelated logic, numerous responsibilities, or a bloated interface. Therefore it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
