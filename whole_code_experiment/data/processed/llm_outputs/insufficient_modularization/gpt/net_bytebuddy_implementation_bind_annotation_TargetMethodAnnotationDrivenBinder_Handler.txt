        "The Handler abstraction is small and focused: it declares only two methods (isBound and bind), indicating a narrow responsibility.",
        "Behavior is cleanly decomposed into two concise nested implementations, Unbound and Bound, each encapsulating distinct logic (fallback binding vs. bound-annotation binding).",
        "Unbound and Bound delegate specific tasks (creating an Argument default, invoking a ParameterBinder) rather than accumulating unrelated responsibilities, demonstrating adequate modularization.",
        "While the surrounding outer class contains many nested types, the Handler interface and its implementations remain cohesive and not excessively large or complex."
