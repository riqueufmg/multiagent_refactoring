    "justification": "The class is small and focused (Null Object implementation of Cache) with a single responsibility. All methods are minimal stubs (create(), put(), get(), remove(), removeAll(), contains(), size(), isEmpty(), stats()) and intentionally do nothing or return default values. There is no evidence of excessive size, bloated interface, or multiple unrelated responsibilities to justify Insufficient Modularization."
