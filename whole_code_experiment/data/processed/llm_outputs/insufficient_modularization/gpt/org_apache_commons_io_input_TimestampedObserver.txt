        "Single responsibility: all methods (getOpenInstant, getCloseInstant, getOpenToCloseDuration, getOpenToNowDuration, isClosed, closed) relate directly to timestamp management for the observer.",
        "No bloated interface or unrelated behavior: there are no unrelated utilities, large conditionals, or multiple distinct responsibilities concentrated in this class.",
        "Thread-safety considered: openInstant is final and closeInstant is volatile, indicating concern for concurrent use rather than mixing responsibilities.",
        "Extends Observer appropriately to fulfill a narrow role within the input package; responsibilities are cohesive and well encapsulated."
