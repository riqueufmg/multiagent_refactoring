    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ClassByExtensionBenchmark.ByteBuddyPrefixInterceptor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The nested class is minimal and highly cohesive: it contains a private constructor that prevents instantiation and a single static method intercept() with no state, no fields, and no branching. Its sole responsibility is to act as a prefix interceptor used by the benchmark. There is no evidence of a bloated API, mixed responsibilities, or excessive size/complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
