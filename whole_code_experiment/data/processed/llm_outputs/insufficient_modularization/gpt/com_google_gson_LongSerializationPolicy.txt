    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a small, focused enum in com.google.gson that defines a single abstract operation serialize(Long). It has exactly two enum constants (DEFAULT and STRING), each encapsulating its own serialization behavior via concise overrides of serialize(Long) that either return JsonPrimitive(value) or JsonPrimitive(value.toString()) and handle null with JsonNull.INSTANCE. There are no large methods, no bloated interface, and responsibilities are clearly separated into the two enum constants, so there is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or combined responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
