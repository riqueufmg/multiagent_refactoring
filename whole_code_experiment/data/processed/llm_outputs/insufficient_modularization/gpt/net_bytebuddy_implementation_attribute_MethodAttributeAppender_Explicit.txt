    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Explicit class is small and cohesive, with a single clear responsibility: appending a provided list of annotations to a method or a method parameter. It contains only two state fields (target, annotations), narrow constructors, a few factory helpers (of, ofMethodAnnotations, ofParameterAnnotations) and one apply(...) method that delegates to AnnotationAppender. Its nested Target interface and its implementations (OnMethod, OnMethodParameter) are directly related to that responsibility. There is no evidence of unrelated functionality, a bloated interface, or excessive complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
