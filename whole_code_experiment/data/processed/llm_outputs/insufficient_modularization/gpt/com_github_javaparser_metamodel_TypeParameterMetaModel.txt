    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: it only declares a constructor and two PropertyMetaModel fields (namePropertyMetaModel, typeBoundPropertyMetaModel). It extends ReferenceTypeMetaModel and appears to be an auto-generated metamodel node (annotated @Generated), following the pattern of one metamodel class per AST node. There is no large interface, no excessive responsibilities or many unrelated fields/methods that would indicate a need to decompose the class further."
