    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "IORunnable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The IORunnable interface is small and cohesive: it declares a single abstract method run() that models an IO-capable Runnable (single responsibility). The additional members are lightweight, closely related helpers: a static noop() factory returning a constant and a default asRunnable() adapter that wraps the IO exception into UncheckedIOException. The @FunctionalInterface annotation, absence of unrelated methods or large implementations, and minimal surface area indicate the abstraction is adequately decomposed and not overly large or bloated."
