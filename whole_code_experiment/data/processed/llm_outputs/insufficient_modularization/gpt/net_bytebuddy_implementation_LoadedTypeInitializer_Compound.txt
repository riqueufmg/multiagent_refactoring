    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "LoadedTypeInitializer.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Compound class has a single, well-defined responsibility: to aggregate and invoke multiple LoadedTypeInitializer instances. It contains one primary field (loadedTypeInitializers), two constructors that normalize/flatten inputs and filter NoOp/Compound entries, and two simple behavior methods (onLoad iterates and delegates; isAlive checks any delegate isAlive). The class is small, cohesive, and uses composition rather than combining unrelated responsibilities, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
