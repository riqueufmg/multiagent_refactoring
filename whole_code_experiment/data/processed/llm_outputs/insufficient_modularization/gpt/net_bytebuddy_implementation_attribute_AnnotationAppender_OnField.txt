    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "AnnotationAppender.OnField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a small, focused wrapper around an ASM FieldVisitor: it has a single private final field (fieldVisitor), a single constructor, and two simple visit methods that delegate to fieldVisitor.visitAnnotation and fieldVisitor.visitTypeAnnotation. It concentrates a single responsibility (writing annotations to a field) and exhibits low complexity and a minimal interface, so there is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or combined responsibilities indicative of insufficient modularization."
