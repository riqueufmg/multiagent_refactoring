    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "SerializedConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SerializedConstant is small and cohesive: it has one private final field (serialization), one constant (CHARSET), a protected constructor, a single factory method (of) that performs serialization, and an apply method that builds a stack manipulation for deserialization. Responsibilities are narrowly focused on representing a serialized value and producing bytecode to recreate it; complex work (bytecode instructions, method/constructor lookups) is delegated to other classes (TextConstant, TypeCreation, MethodInvocation, etc.). There is no evidence of a bloated interface, excessive size, or multiple unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
