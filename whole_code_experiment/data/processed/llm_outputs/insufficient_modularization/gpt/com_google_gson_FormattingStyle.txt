    "justification": "FormattingStyle is small and cohesive: it contains only three private final fields (newline, indent, spaceAfterSeparators), an input-validating constructor, three withX factory-style mutators, three simple accessors, and two static presets (COMPACT, PRETTY). Responsibilities are narrowly focused on describing output formatting for JSON; there are no large methods, no unrelated responsibilities, and no bloated interface to justify further decomposition. The class is immutable and the withX methods return modified copies, showing a clear single responsibility and good modularization."
