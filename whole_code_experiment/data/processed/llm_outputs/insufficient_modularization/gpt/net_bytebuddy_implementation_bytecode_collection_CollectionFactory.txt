    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed type is a narrow interface (CollectionFactory) that declares only two methods: getComponentType() and withValues(List<? extends StackManipulation>). Both methods are cohesive and pertain to a single abstraction (creating collections/arrays from provided values). The interface surface is small, has no large number of responsibilities, no long method bodies or internal state, and uses precise types (TypeDescription.Generic and StackManipulation) that indicate clear separation of concerns. There is no evidence of a bloated API or combined unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
