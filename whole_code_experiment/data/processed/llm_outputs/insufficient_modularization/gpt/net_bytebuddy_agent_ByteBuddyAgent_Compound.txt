    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ByteBuddyAgent.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The AttachmentProvider.Compound class is small and cohesive: it maintains a single field (attachmentProviders), provides constructors that flatten nested Compound instances, and implements a single behavior attempt() that delegates to contained AttachmentProvider instances and returns the first available Accessor (or Accessor.Unavailable.INSTANCE). It cleanly composes responsibility rather than accumulating unrelated functionality or a bloated interface, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
