    "justification": "ECIEncoderSet is small and focused: it encapsulates the creation and query of a set of CharsetEncoders for a specific input string. Responsibilities are cohesive (building neededEncoders in the constructor, maintaining encoders[] and priority index, and providing accessor/encoding methods). Public surface is limited (length, getCharsetName, getCharset, getECIValue, getPriorityEncoderIndex, canEncode, encode) and fields are minimal (encoders, priorityEncoderIndex). The static ENCODERS list is a self-contained platform capability lookup. There is no evidence of a bloated interface, multiple unrelated responsibilities, or excessive size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
