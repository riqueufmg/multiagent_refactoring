    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ByteCodeAppender.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Compound class is small and cohesive: it stores a list of ByteCodeAppender, flattens nested Compound instances in its constructor, and its apply(...) method simply delegates to contained appenders and merges their Size results. It implements a single clear responsibility (composition of appenders) without a bloated API or unrelated methods, so there is no indication that it requires further decomposition."
