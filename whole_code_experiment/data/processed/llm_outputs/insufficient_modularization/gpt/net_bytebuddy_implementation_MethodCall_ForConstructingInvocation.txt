    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "MethodCall.ForConstructingInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it has a single field (instrumentedType) and three focused methods (resolve, getTypeDescription, toStackManipulation) that all relate to invoking a constructor by creating a new instance (uses TypeCreation.of(...) and Duplication.SINGLE). Its nested Factory enum only provides trivial creation/prepare logic. There are no unrelated responsibilities, no large/bloated interface, and minimal state, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
