    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it encapsulates a single responsibility (managing codewords for a column and mapping image rows to array indices). It has only two private final fields (boundingBox, codewords) and a limited set of focused methods (getCodewordNearby, imageRowToCodewordIndex, setCodeword, getCodeword, getBoundingBox, getCodewords, toString). No large methods, no mixed responsibilities, and internal logic (nearby search) is directly related to the class's purpose. There is no evidence of a bloated interface or excessive size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
