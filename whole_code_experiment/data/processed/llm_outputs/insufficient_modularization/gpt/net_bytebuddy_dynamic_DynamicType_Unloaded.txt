        "DynamicType.Unloaded is a small, focused nested interface that adds only a few closely related responsibilities (loading the dynamic type into a ClassLoader and including auxiliary types).",
        "It declares only the load(...) overloads and include(...) variants; the surface area is minimal and cohesive (all methods concern turning an unloaded dynamic type into a loaded one or composing auxiliary types).",
        "The broader DynamicType abstraction centralizes many other responsibilities in separate nested interfaces/classes (Builder, Loaded, AbstractBase, Default, etc.), so functionality is already decomposed appropriately and Unloaded is not bloated."
