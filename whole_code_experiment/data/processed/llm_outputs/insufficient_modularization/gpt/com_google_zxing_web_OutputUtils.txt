    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it defines two constants, a private constructor, one public static method (arrayToString) and one small private helper (hexChar). Its sole responsibility is formatting byte arrays as hex for decoderesult.jspx. There is no long/bloated interface, no large number of unrelated methods, and no concentration of multiple responsibilities that would indicate insufficient decomposition."
