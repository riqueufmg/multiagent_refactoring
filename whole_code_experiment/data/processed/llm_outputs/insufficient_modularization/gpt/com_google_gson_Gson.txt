    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Gson",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Gson class centralizes many distinct responsibilities and is relatively large and feature-rich: its constructor builds and registers a long list of TypeAdapterFactory instances (the factories list) and instantiates jsonAdapterFactory and constructorConstructor; it manages adapter creation and caching (threadLocalAdapterResults, typeTokenCache, getAdapter, getDelegateAdapter) including proxying for cyclic graphs (nested FutureTypeAdapter); it provides many IO/configuration concerns (newJsonWriter, newJsonReader, strictness/htmlSafe/serializeNulls handling, Streams wiring, assertFullConsumption); it contains numerous type-specific adapter helpers (doubleAdapter, floatAdapter, longAdapter, atomicLongAdapter, atomicLongArrayAdapter) and many public overloads for toJson/fromJson/toJsonTree/fromJson. The class also holds a large set of configuration fields (excluder, fieldNamingStrategy, instanceCreators, formattingStyle, strictness, serialization policies, number strategies, reflectionFilters). Concentrating adapter registry/creation, caching, IO configuration, numeric/atomic adapters, strictness handling and public API surface in one class indicates insufficient decomposition and low modularity; these concerns could be separated into smaller, cohesive components (adapter registry/factory manager, cache/proxy manager, IO/configuration helper, numeric adapter factory, etc.)."
