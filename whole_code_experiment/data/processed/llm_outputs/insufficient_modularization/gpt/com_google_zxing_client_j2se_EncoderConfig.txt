    "justification": "EncoderConfig is a small, focused data-holder for command-line parameters (fields: barcodeFormat, imageFormat, outputFileBase, width, height, errorCorrectionLevel, help, contents) annotated with JCommander @Parameter. It has a single responsibility (encapsulating CLI configuration) and contains no business logic, large methods, or mixed responsibilities that would justify further decomposition. Its size and interface are concise and cohesive within the com.google.zxing.client.j2se context."
