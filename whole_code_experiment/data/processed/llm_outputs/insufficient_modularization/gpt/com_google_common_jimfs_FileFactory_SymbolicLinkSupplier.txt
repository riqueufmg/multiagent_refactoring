    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The SymbolicLinkSupplier is a small, focused private inner class with a single responsibility: hold a JimfsPath target (final field), validate it in the constructor (checkNotNull), and create a SymbolicLink via get() which delegates to the outer FileFactory.createSymbolicLink(target). It defines a minimal interface (one method) and contains no unrelated behavior or excessive size. While the enclosing FileFactory contains multiple factory responsibilities, this inner supplier itself is cohesive and appropriately modular."
