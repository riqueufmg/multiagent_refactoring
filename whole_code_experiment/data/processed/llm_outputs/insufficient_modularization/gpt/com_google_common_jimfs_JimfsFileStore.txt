        "JimfsFileStore primarily acts as a thin facade/coordinator rather than a bloated, monolithic class: most methods immediately delegate to specialized collaborators (examples: tree.lookUp(...), factory.regularFileCreator(), factory.directoryCreator(), factory.symbolicLinkCreator(...), attributes.readAttributes(...), attributes.setAttribute(...), disk.getTotalSpace(), disk.getUnallocatedSpace()).",
        "Its fields represent clearly separated responsibilities (FileTree tree, FileFactory factory, HeapDisk disk, AttributeService attributes, FileSystemState state), indicating functionality has been modularized into distinct classes rather than concentrated here.",
        "Methods are short and focused (e.g., lookUp, setInitialAttributes, readAttributes, getRootDirectoryNames) and contain little internal logic, reducing cognitive load and avoiding mixed responsibilities.",
        "Concurrency/state concerns are limited and well-scoped (it creates and exposes ReadWriteLock and calls state.checkOpen()), rather than being intermixed with unrelated business logic.",
        "Given the delegation pattern and clear separation of concerns, the class does not exhibit the characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
