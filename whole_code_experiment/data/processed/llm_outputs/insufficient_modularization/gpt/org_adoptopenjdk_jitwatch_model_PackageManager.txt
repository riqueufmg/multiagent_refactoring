    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PackageManager has a focused, small API and a single cohesive responsibility: managing MetaPackage and MetaClass registries and building package hierarchy. Its state is limited to metaClasses (Map), metaPackages (Map) and roots (List). Public methods are few and narrowly scoped (clear, addMetaClass, getMetaClass, getMetaPackage, buildPackage, getRootPackages) and a single small private helper (storePackage) is used. The only non-trivial method, buildPackage, implements a contained task (parsing a package name and creating parent/child MetaPackage objects). There is no evidence of excessive size, multiple unrelated responsibilities, or a bloated interface that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
