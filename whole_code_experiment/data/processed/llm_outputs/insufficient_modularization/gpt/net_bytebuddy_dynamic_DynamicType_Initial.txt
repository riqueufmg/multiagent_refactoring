    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The analyzed type (the DynamicType interface and its nested types) is extremely large and contains many distinct responsibilities concentrated in a single top-level abstraction. Evidence: (1) Numerous nested builder interfaces and deep adapter/implementation classes (Builder, Builder.AbstractBase, Builder.Adapter, ModuleDefinitionAdapter, FieldDefinitionAdapter, MethodDefinitionAdapter, RecordComponentDefinitionAdapter, etc.) that encode building, matching and materialization logic. (2) Mixed concerns within the same type: API surface for type construction (defineField/defineMethod/defineProperty/etc.), low-level I/O and packaging (saveIn, toJar, inject, doInject, manifest handling, JarInputStream/ JarOutputStream use), class loading and initialization (load, ClassLoadingStrategy, InjectionClassLoader handling, Loaded/Unloaded implementations), and bytecode/type writing (TypeWriter, AsmVisitorWrapper, AsmClassReader/Writer). (3) Very large public API with many unrelated groups of methods (module definition, inner-type handling, record components, attribute appenders, transformers, matchers, registry management). These indicate a bloated abstraction that bundles many cohesive modules (builder, writer, loader, IO utilities, module descriptor management, adapter factories) into one type, matching the Insufficient Modularization smell."
