    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and single-purpose: it contains only a generated constructor that forwards parameters to the superclass (StatementMetaModel) to represent the EmptyStmt meta-model. It is annotated as @Generated, indicating it is produced by a metamodel generator. There are no additional fields, methods, or mixed responsibilities, no large or bloated interface, and no signs of excessive complexity that would warrant decomposing the class further."
