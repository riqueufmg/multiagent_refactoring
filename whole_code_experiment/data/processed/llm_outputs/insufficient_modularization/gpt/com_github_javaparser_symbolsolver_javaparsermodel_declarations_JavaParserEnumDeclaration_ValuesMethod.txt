    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "JavaParserEnumDeclaration.ValuesMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The ValuesMethod nested class is small and focused on a single responsibility: modelling the implicit enum values() method. It only holds two fields (enumDeclaration, typeSolver) and implements a limited set of methods required by ResolvedMethodDeclaration and TypeVariableResolutionCapability (e.g. declaringType, getReturnType, getNumberOfParams, isStatic, getName, toDescriptor). It delegates resolution and context work to the enclosing enumDeclaration/typeSolver and throws UnsupportedOperationException only for operations that are not applicable. There is no bloated interface, no mixing of unrelated responsibilities, and minimal state, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
