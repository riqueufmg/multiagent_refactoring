        "Its sole responsibility is to locate the component type of an annotation property by querying the provided TypePool and inspecting a single annotation method return type; there is no mixing of unrelated concerns.",
        "There is no large public API surface or many unrelated methods/fields that would indicate a bloated interface or excessive complexity.",
        "Behavior is delegated to TypePool and its TypeDescription API (cohesive, single-responsibility), so no decomposition is necessary."
