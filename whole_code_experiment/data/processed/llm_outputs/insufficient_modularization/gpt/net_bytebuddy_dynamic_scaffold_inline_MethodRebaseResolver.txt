    "justification": [
        "The interface file contains many distinct responsibilities packed together: the public API (MethodRebaseResolver), multiple Resolution variants (Preserved, ForRebasedMethod, ForRebasedConstructor), nested types describing rebased methods/constructors (RebasedMethod, RebasedConstructor) and a full Default implementation with construction logic.",
        "Default.make(...) performs complex construction logic (placeholder auxiliary type creation, iterating declared methods, distinguishing constructors vs. methods, building resolutions and auxiliary types) which is more than a simple resolver behavior and mixes factory logic, bookkeeping, and type generation.",
        "Nested RebasedMethod and RebasedConstructor implement method-description transformation logic (return types, parameters, modifiers, internal names) which represent separate concerns that could be extracted to dedicated classes to reduce the size and coupling of the interface file.",
        "The large number of nested classes and responsibilities concentrated in one unit increases complexity, coupling and maintenance burden (mapping resolutions, auxiliary type lifecycle, signature transformation and token-map conversion), indicating insufficient decomposition into smaller, cohesive modules."
