        "The class is large and bundles many different responsibilities: benchmark lifecycle management, measurement for multiple modes, sampling, and state initialization. Examples: methods benchmarkByteBuddyWithProxyAndReusedDelegatorWithTypePool_Throughput, _AverageTime, _SampleTime, _SingleShotTime and their corresponding *_jmhStub variants all live in the same class.",
        "There is substantial duplicated and mode-specific logic mixed together (warmup/warmdown loops, notifyControl handling, blackhole consumption) across the multiple benchmark mode methods rather than isolated helpers (see repeated blocks in each mode method).",
        "The class contains many fields that increase its size and surface area (p000..p255 padding fields, startRndMask, benchmarkParams, iterationParams, threadParams, blackhole, notifyControl, f_classbyextensionbenchmark0_0), indicating a bloated interface and state that could be partitioned.",
        "Sample handling and sampling algorithm (benchmarkByteBuddyWithProxyAndReusedDelegatorWithTypePool_sample_jmhStub, SampleBuffer usage, rnd/rndMask logic) are embedded alongside lifecycle and measurement code instead of being separated into a dedicated sampler/collector component."
