    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.FieldTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it has a single private final field (ElementMatcher<? super TypeDescription.Generic> matcher), a constructor, one core behavior method (doMatch) that simply delegates to matcher.matches(target.getType()), and a toString override for representation. There are no multiple responsibilities, no large or complex methods, and no bloated interface or many fields to suggest insufficient decomposition. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
