    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and highly cohesive: it encapsulates a single responsibility (efficiently generating random integers of a requested bit length using a byte cache). It has one core public method (nextBits) plus a constructor, and state limited to cache, random, and bitIndex with supporting constants (MAX_CACHE_SIZE, MAX_BITS, BIT_INDEX_MASK, BITS_PER_BYTE). The bit-extraction and cache-replenishment logic belong to the same abstraction and are implemented together; there are no unrelated responsibilities, no large unrelated branches, and the class is package-private and final (used internally by RandomStringUtils). These facts indicate the abstraction is sufficiently modular and does not suffer from insufficient modularization."
