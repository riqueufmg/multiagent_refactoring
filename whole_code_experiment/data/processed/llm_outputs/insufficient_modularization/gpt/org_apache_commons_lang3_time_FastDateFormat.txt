    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": [
        "The class is small and primarily delegates responsibilities: it holds two private final fields 'printer' (FastDatePrinter) and 'parser' (FastDateParser) which encapsulate the formatting and parsing logic respectively.",
        "Constructors immediately create FastDatePrinter and FastDateParser (protected FastDateFormat(...)), indicating decomposition of behavior into separate classes rather than consolidating logic here.",
        "Nearly all public methods are thin wrappers that delegate to printer or parser (e.g. format(Calendar), format(Date), format(long), parse(String), parse(String, ParsePosition), parse(String, ParsePosition, Calendar)), showing single-responsibility and modular design.",
        "The class uses a dedicated cache (private static final AbstractFormatCache<FastDateFormat> CACHE) and static factory methods to obtain instances, keeping caching and creation concerns separated from formatting/parsing implementations.",
        "There are no large monolithic methods or duplicated responsibilities inside FastDateFormat; it acts as a façade that composes smaller cohesive components (FastDatePrinter/FastDateParser), so insufficient modularization is not present."
