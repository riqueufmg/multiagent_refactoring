    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is focused on a single, well-defined responsibility: representing a constructor AST node. It contains only one intrinsic field (body) and several constructors and small accessor/mutator methods (getBody, setBody). Most behaviour is simple delegation or standard node functionality (accept visitors, clone, getMetaModel, replace, type-casting helpers, resolve), and many methods are generated (annotations like @Generated) or override behavior from superclasses/interfaces. Complex concerns are delegated to superclasses (CallableDeclaration) and other node types. There is no evidence of a large, bloated interface or unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
