    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": ["StreamDrainer"],
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The StreamDrainer class is small and cohesive: it exposes a single primary responsibility (draining an InputStream to a byte[] via the drain(InputStream) method) and simple configuration via bufferSize and related constructors (DEFAULT, DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE, StreamDrainer(int)). All fields and methods relate directly to the single task of reading and buffering stream data (bufferSize, DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE, END_OF_STREAM, FROM_BEGINNING, drain implementation). There is no evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities, a bloated public interface, or excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
