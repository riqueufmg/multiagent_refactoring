    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "SimplePathVisitor.AbstractBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The AbstractBuilder is small and focused: it contains a single private field (visitFileFailedFunction), a getter, a fluent setter, and an empty constructor. It serves a single responsibility (supplying/configuring the visitFileFailed function for subclasses) and uses generics to support subclass builders via AbstractSupplier. There are no many unrelated methods, large fields, or mixed responsibilities that would indicate an overly large or bloated abstraction, so insufficient modularization is not present."
