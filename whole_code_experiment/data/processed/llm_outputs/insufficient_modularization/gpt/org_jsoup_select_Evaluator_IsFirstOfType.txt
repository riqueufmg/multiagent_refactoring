    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": ["Evaluator"],
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Evaluator class file contains a very large number of distinct evaluator implementations as nested static classes, concentrating many responsibilities in one class. Examples include Tag, TagStartsWith, TagEndsWith, Id, Class, Attribute, AttributeStarting, AttributeWithValue, AttributeWithValueNot, AttributeWithValueStarting, AttributeWithValueEnding, AttributeWithValueContaining, AttributeWithValueMatching, AttributeKeyPair, AllElements, IndexLessThan, IndexGreaterThan, IndexEquals, IsLastChild, IsFirstOfType, IsLastOfType, CssNthEvaluator, IsNthChild, IsNthLastChild, IsNthOfType, IsNthLastOfType, IsFirstChild, IsRoot, IsOnlyChild, IsOnlyOfType, IsEmpty, IndexEvaluator, ContainsText, ContainsWholeText, ContainsWholeOwnText, ContainsData, ContainsOwnText, Matches, MatchesOwn, MatchesWholeText, MatchesWholeOwnText, and deprecated MatchText. These nested classes cover multiple orthogonal concerns (attribute matching, positional selectors, text/regex matching, node handling, deprecated DOM transformation) and many have their own state and behavior (e.g. AttributeKeyPair normalization/quoting logic, CssNthEvaluator position calculation, Regex-based matchers). The file is large and mixes factory/base behavior with many concrete implementations instead of modularizing them into separate, cohesive classes or files. This concentration increases size, cognitive complexity, and maintenance burden and indicates insufficient decomposition of the evaluator abstractions."
