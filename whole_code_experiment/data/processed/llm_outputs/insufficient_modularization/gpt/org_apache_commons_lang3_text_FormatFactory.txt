    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The FormatFactory type is a small, cohesive interface with a single responsibility: producing Format instances via one method (Format getFormat(String name, String arguments, Locale locale)). It has no fields, no long methods or bloated API surface, and encapsulates the factory abstraction appropriately. There is no evidence of excessive size, multiple unrelated responsibilities, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization. (The class is deprecated, but that relates to library evolution, not a modularization smell in this type.)"
