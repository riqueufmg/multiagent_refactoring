        "The class is small and focused: it encapsulates a single responsibility (representing a non-generic receiver type) with only a couple of constructors and a few simple accessor methods (getOwnerType, getComponentType, getDeclaredAnnotations, asErasure).",
        "It has one field (typeDescription) and no complex logic or multiple unrelated responsibilities (no parsing, no large state management, no utility methods).",
        "Methods delegate to related types/structures (TypeDescription, LazyAnnotationDescription) rather than mixing responsibilities, indicating high cohesion and appropriate modularization within its nested context."
