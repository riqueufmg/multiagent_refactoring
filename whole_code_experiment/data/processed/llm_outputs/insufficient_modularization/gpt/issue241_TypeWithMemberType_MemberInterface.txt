    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "TypeWithMemberType.MemberInterface",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed member type is an empty nested interface (no methods or fields) and contains no implementation. It has minimal size and no bloated or mixed responsibilities that would indicate a lack of decomposition. There is no large interface surface, no long methods, and no evidence that responsibilities are concentrated in this type; therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
