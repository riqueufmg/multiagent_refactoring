    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AbstractBase is small and focused: it implements a concise set of package-related behaviors (getInternalName, getActualName, contains, isDefault, hashCode, equals, toString) that delegate to getName(), preserving a single responsibility. Concrete variants are factored into nested classes (Simple and ForLoadedPackage) that separate annotation handling and name storage/representation, avoiding a bloated monolithic class. There is no large state, excessive branching, or unrelated functionality concentrated in AbstractBase that would indicate poor decomposition."
