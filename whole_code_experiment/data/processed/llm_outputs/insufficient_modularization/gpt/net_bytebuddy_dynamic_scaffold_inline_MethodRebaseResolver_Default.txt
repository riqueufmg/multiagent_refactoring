    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "MethodRebaseResolver.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Default is small and cohesive: it holds two related fields (resolutions, dynamicTypes), a protected constructor, a factory method make(...) that assembles the resolver, and three simple instance methods (resolve, getAuxiliaryTypes, asTokenMap). The class has a single clear responsibility (managing method rebase resolutions and associated auxiliary types) and delegates representation/details of rebased methods to the nested Resolution classes (ForRebasedMethod, ForRebasedConstructor, Preserved). There is no evidence of excessive size, sprawling responsibilities, or a bloated interface within Default (no large number of unrelated methods or fields), so it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
