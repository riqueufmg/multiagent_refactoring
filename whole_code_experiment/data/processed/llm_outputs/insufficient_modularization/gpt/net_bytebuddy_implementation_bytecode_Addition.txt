    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Addition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Addition enum is small and cohesive: it defines four well-scoped constants (INTEGER, LONG, FLOAT, DOUBLE) each encapsulating two private fields (opcode, stackSize) and a single responsibility (emit the appropriate add instruction). Its API is minimal (constructor, isValid() returning true, and apply() which issues the opcode and returns the stack size adjustment). There is no evidence of mixed responsibilities, large size, or bloated interface; behavior is properly decomposed by enum constants for each primitive type and the implementation is focused on a single, clear task within the bytecode package."
