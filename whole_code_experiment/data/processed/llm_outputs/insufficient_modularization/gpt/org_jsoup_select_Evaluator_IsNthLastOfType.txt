    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Evaluator.IsNthLastOfType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Evaluator.IsNthLastOfType is small and cohesive: it only defines a constructor, overrides calculatePosition(Element root, Element element) to count matching following-siblings, and getPseudoClass() returning \"nth-last-of-type\". It has no extraneous fields or responsibilities, inherits common behavior from CssNthEvaluator, and encapsulates a single, well-defined piece of logic. There is no evidence of a bloated interface, large size, or mixed responsibilities within this class."
