    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "MethodAccessorFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The interface is small and cohesive: it declares exactly three related factory methods (registerAccessorFor, registerGetterFor, registerSetterFor) all concerned with creating accessor methods. Related concerns are encapsulated as nested types (AccessType for visibility and Illegal as a sentinel implementation), avoiding scattering of unrelated responsibilities. There is no large monolithic class body, no long method implementations, and no unrelated APIs combined in this type. Therefore it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
