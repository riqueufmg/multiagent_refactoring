        "The class is small and focused: it has one field (parserConfiguration), simple constructors, a getter, and a single public behavior (collect).",
        "collect(Path) delegates traversal to Files.walkFileTree and encapsulates traversal logic inside a short anonymous SimpleFileVisitor with three focused overrides (visitFile, preVisitDirectory, postVisitDirectory).",
        "Responsibilities are cohesive: discovering source roots (using getRoot, javaMatcher, and projectRoot.addSourceRoot) is a single concern rather than multiple unrelated ones.",
        "There is no large or bloated public interface, no many unrelated methods/fields, and no excessive complexity that would indicate the class should be decomposed further."
