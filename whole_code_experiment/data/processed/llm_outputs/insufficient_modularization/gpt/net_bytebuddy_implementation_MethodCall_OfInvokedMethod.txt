        "The analyzed nested class is small and focused: it only stores a single int field (index), validates inputs in resolve(...), and produces a list of ForMethodParameterArrayElement instances corresponding to the invoked method's parameters.",
        "It implements two narrowly-scoped interfaces (ArgumentLoader.Factory and ArgumentProvider) and its methods each fulfill a single, cohesive responsibility (prepare returns the unmodified instrumented type, make returns this, resolve performs validation and constructs argument loaders).",
        "There is no evidence of multiple, unrelated responsibilities, excessive size, or a bloated interface in this class: no large methods, no many fields, and no cross-cutting concerns handled here — complexity is delegated to ForMethodParameterArrayElement and other surrounding types.",
        "Because the class is cohesive, small, and has a single clear reason to change, it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
