        "The ClassFileLocator interface file contains a very large number of nested implementations and helpers (MultiReleaseAware, Simple, ForClassLoader (+ WeaklyReferenced), ForModule (+ WeaklyReferenced), ForJarFile, ForModuleFile, ForFolder, ForUrl, ForInstrumentation (with Dispatcher, ClassLoadingDelegate and many nested delegates), PackageDiscriminating, Filtering, Compound, etc.), concentrating many responsibilities in one top-level type.",
        "These nested types address orthogonal concerns: filesystem and archive I/O (ForFolder, ForJarFile, ForModuleFile), class loader/resource lookup (ForClassLoader, ForUrl), Java module/jmod support (ForModule, ForModuleFile, boot layer logic), multi-release JAR handling (MultiReleaseAware logic), instrumentation and retransformation (ForInstrumentation, ExtractionClassFileTransformer, Dispatcher), and composition/filtering of locators (Compound, Filtering, PackageDiscriminating).",
        "There is deep nesting and complex internal logic (reflection, privileged actions, manifest parsing, version detection, dispatcher patterns), which increases class size and coupling and reduces cohesion; many of these concern implementations are better split into separate top-level classes or packages to respect the single-responsibility principle.",
        "Multiple static factory methods and platform-specific detection logic are embedded in the same artifact rather than modularized, making the file hard to understand, test, and maintain."
