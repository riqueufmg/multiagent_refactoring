        "MethodCall has a focused responsibility: implementing an Invocation implementation for proxy method calls (prepare and producing a ByteCodeAppender).",
        "The class is small and exposes only a single field (methodAccessorFactory), a constructor, prepare(), and appender() methods — no large public API or bloated interface.",
        "Complex logic is decomposed into inner helper classes (Appender and AccessorMethodInvocation) that encapsulate bytecode emission and stack manipulation, indicating deliberate modularization of concerns.",
        "There is no evidence of many unrelated responsibilities or excessive size/complexity within MethodCall itself; behavior is cohesive and delegated where appropriate."
