    "justification": [
        "NumberStrategy is small and focused: it has a single field (field), a constructor, and a small set of behavior methods (isNumber, modify, parse, toString).",
        "The parse method implements a single responsibility (parsing a numeric field from the input and setting the Calendar), with clear, limited logic for trimming whitespace, enforcing maxWidth, digit extraction and integer parsing.",
        "Extensibility is provided via the protected modify(parser, iValue) hook which allows concise customization in anonymous subclasses (as used elsewhere in this class), showing modular design rather than monolithic functionality.",
        "There are no large switch statements, multiple unrelated responsibilities, or bloated public API on NumberStrategy — it delegates locale/text handling to other Strategy subclasses (PatternStrategy, CaseInsensitiveTextStrategy, TimeZoneStrategy), indicating proper decomposition at the class hierarchy level."
