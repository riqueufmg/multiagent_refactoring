    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "AnonymousClassDeclarationContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is focused on a single cohesive responsibility: providing a symbol-resolution context for anonymous class object-creation nodes. Its state is minimal (one field: myDeclaration) and it exposes three clear responsibilities implemented as overrides: solveMethod, solveType, and solveSymbol. Each method delegates substantial logic to other components (e.g., MethodResolutionLogic, JavaParserFacade, JavaParserFactory, JavaParserAnonymousClassDeclaration, ReflectionClassDeclaration) rather than hoarding unrelated behavior. The code size and complexity are moderate and limited to resolving methods, types, and symbols for anonymous classes (including special cases for ancestors and interfaces), indicating good modular separation rather than a bloated, multi-responsibility class."
