    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ErrorCorrectionLevel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a small, focused enum representing four QR error-correction levels. It has a single responsibility (encapsulating the levels and their associated two-bit codes), only two fields (bits and FOR_BITS) and two simple methods (getBits and forBits). There are no unrelated responsibilities, large methods, bloated interface, or excessive state that would indicate it needs decomposition. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
