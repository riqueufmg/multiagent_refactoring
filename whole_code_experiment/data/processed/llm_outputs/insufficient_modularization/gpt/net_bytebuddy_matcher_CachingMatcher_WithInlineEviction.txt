    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "CachingMatcher.WithInlineEviction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The nested class is small and cohesive: it introduces a single field (evictionSize) and overrides one method (onCacheMiss) to perform a single, well-scoped responsibility (evict an entry when the cache exceeds a size and then delegate to super). There are no large numbers of methods or fields, no mixed responsibilities, and the class simply extends CachingMatcher to add eviction behavior, so it does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface."
