    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": [
        "The class centralizes many distinct responsibilities into a single static utility: type lookup (findType, demandClass, demandClassOrInterface, demandEnum, getOuterTypeName/getInnerTypeName), member accessors (demandConstructor, demandField, demandMethod), general AST navigation/search (demandParentNode, demandNodeOfGivenClass, demandReturnStmt, demandSwitch, findMethodCall, findNameExpression, findSimpleName, demandVariableDeclaration), and small helpers (findSwitchHelper).",
        "Multiple methods perform different, potentially unrelated domain tasks (e.g. textual qualified-type parsing in getOuterTypeName/getInnerTypeName vs. node searches like findMethodCall), indicating low cohesion and a bloated interface.",
        "Repetitive iteration and type-checking logic appears in several places (demandConstructor, demandField, demandMethod, findType(TypeDeclaration<?>)), which suggests these responsibilities could be decomposed into focused components (e.g. TypeNavigator, MemberNavigator, SearchNavigator) to improve modularity.",
        "Presence of deprecated wrapper methods (findNodeOfGivenClass, findReturnStmt, findSwitch, requireParentNode) increases surface area and indicates legacy/overlapping APIs retained in the same class rather than separated or refactored.",
        "A TODO comment in demandConstructor ('Refactor to use `td.findAll(ConstructorDeclaration.class);` - potential difference re: searching only immediate children?') signals recognized maintenance/refactoring needs and complexity that would benefit from modularization.",
        "The class is final with a private constructor and only static methods, acting as a large ‘god’ utility class rather than smaller cohesive modules — a typical sign of insufficient modularization."
