    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it only declares static final String keys and a single lifecycle method onCreate that delegates UI work to PreferencesFragment. There is no large method, complex logic, or mixed responsibilities concentrated in this class. Preference UI and behavior are handled by the fragment, so modularization is appropriate."
