        "The nested FieldTokenList is very small and focused: it only implements two methods (get and size) that delegate to an existing fieldTokens collection and convert entries via toFieldDescription. It has a single, clear responsibility (presenting field tokens as a FieldList) and a minimal interface. There is no evidence of excessive size, multiple unrelated responsibilities, or a bloated API in this class (implementation shown: get(int) returns fieldTokens.get(index).toFieldDescription(...); size() returns fieldTokens.size()). Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
