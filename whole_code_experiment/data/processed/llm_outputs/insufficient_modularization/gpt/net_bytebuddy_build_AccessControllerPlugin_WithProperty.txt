    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin.WithProperty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The WithProperty class is a small, focused inner class with a single responsibility: provide an implementation of Initializer.onAccessController that reads a named system property and returns a boolean. It contains only one field (property), a constructor, and a single method (onAccessController) that performs a concise, well-scoped operation. It does not aggregate multiple unrelated responsibilities, large data structures, or a bloated interface, and is cohesive within the Initializer abstraction, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
