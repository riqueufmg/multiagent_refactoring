        "The class is small and focused: it holds two Method fields (register, clean) and provides three concise behaviors (isAlive, clean, register) plus a constructor.",
        "Its sole responsibility is to act as a reflective dispatcher wrapper invoking Nexus methods; it does not accumulate unrelated responsibilities or a bloated API surface.",
        "Methods are simple delegations that handle reflection exceptions and translate them into IllegalStateException; there is no large method logic, extensive branching, or many fields that would indicate poor decomposition.",
        "Given its cohesive role and minimal state, there is no evidence that this class should be decomposed further to improve modularity."
