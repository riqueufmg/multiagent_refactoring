    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it has a single responsibility of converting an Iterable<TypeDefinition> to a list of TypeDescription erasures and delegating matching to the contained matcher. Evidence: one private final field 'matcher', a single constructor, the focused method 'doMatch(T target)' which only maps elements via 'typeDefinition.asErasure()' and calls 'matcher.matches(...)', and a simple 'toString()' override. There are no multiple responsibilities, no large number of methods or fields, and no bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
