    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Builder class is small and focused: it only provides a no-arg constructor and an overridden get() method that constructs an ObservableInputStream. It delegates configuration/state to AbstractBuilder and does not contain multiple, unrelated responsibilities, large data structures, or a bloated interface. There is no excessive size or complexity in this class (only two trivial methods), so it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
