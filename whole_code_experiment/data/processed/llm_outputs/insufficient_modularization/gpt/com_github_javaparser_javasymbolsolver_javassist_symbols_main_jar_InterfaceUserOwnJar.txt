    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is minimal and cohesive: it only declares a single static final field (OWN_FIELD) and implements one interface (InterfaceOwnJar). There are no multiple responsibilities, no large number of methods or fields, and no bloated interface to suggest it should be decomposed further. Given its small size and single, simple purpose, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
