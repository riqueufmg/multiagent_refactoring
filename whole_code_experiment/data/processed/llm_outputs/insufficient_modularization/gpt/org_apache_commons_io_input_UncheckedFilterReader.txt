    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "UncheckedFilterReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused on a single responsibility: adapting a Reader to rethrow IOExceptions as UncheckedIOException. It only overrides a limited set of Reader methods (close, mark, read overloads, ready, reset, skip) and delegates to the superclass using the Uncheck utility. Construction is encapsulated in a simple nested Builder that extends AbstractStreamBuilder. The class is final, has a private constructor, and does not contain unrelated fields, large methods, or a bloated interface. These elements indicate good modularization rather than an insufficiency."
