    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The interface is small and cohesive, modeling a single abstraction (a package description). Responsibilities are separated: AbstractBase provides shared behavior (getInternalName, getActualName, contains, isDefault, equals/hashCode/toString), while Simple and ForLoadedPackage are focused, lightweight implementations (Simple holds a name and returns an empty AnnotationList; ForLoadedPackage wraps java.lang.Package to expose name and annotations). The public surface is minimal (contains, isDefault, runtime name/annotation source methods and a few constants), so there is no evidence of excessive size, bloated interface, or concentrated unrelated responsibilities."
