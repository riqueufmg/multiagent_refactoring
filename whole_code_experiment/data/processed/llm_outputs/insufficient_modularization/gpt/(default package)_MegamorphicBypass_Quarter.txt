        "Quarter is a very small, cohesive class: it implements a single method deposit() that performs one simple action (moneyBox += 25).",
        "It does not have a large interface, many fields, or multiple responsibilities to indicate poor decomposition.",
        "There is no internal complexity, branching, or size that would suggest the class should be split into smaller abstractions.",
        "Although it is an inner class and references the outer static moneyBox, that coupling does not make Quarter bloated or multi-responsibility; its behavior remains narrowly focused."
