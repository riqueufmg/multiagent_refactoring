        "The Builder (and its AbstractBuilder) are narrowly focused on construction/configuration of CountingPathVisitor: fields are limited to pathCounters, fileFilter, directoryFilter, and directoryPostTransformer and setters only mutate these fields (setDirectoryFilter, setDirectoryPostTransformer, setFileFilter, setPathCounters).",
        "Construction logic is delegated: Builder.get() returns a new CountingPathVisitor(this), and CountingPathVisitor contains the traversal and counting behavior, preserving separation of concerns between building and runtime behavior.",
        "CountingPathVisitor itself is cohesive: methods are small and single-purpose (accept, visitFile, preVisitDirectory, postVisitDirectory, updateFileCounters, updateDirCounter) and it delegates counting and filtering to PathCounters and PathFilter rather than embedding those responsibilities.",
        "There are no large monolithic methods, no mixing of unrelated responsibilities, and sensible defaults are provided via small static helpers (defaultDirectoryFilter, defaultFileFilter, defaultPathCounters, defaultDirectoryTransformer), indicating adequate decomposition and modularization."
