    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ToStringMethod.ForFixedValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class (net.bytebuddy.implementation.ToStringMethod.ForFixedValue) is small and single-responsibility: it has one private final field 'prefix', a protected constructor, and a single method 'resolve' that returns that prefix. It only implements the PrefixResolver interface behavior for a fixed value and is annotated for generated equals/hashCode. There is no large interface, no bloated public API, and no concentration of multiple unrelated responsibilities within this class. Any larger behavior lives in the enclosing ToStringMethod, so the nested ForFixedValue remains cohesive and appropriately modular."
