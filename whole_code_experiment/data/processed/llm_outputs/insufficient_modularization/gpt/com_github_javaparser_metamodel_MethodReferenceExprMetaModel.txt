    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "This class is small, generated, and focused on a single responsibility: representing the meta-model for MethodReferenceExpr. It contains a single constructor delegating to the superclass and four public PropertyMetaModel fields (identifierPropertyMetaModel, scopePropertyMetaModel, typeArgumentsPropertyMetaModel, usingDiamondOperatorPropertyMetaModel). There is no large method body, no mixed responsibilities, and no bloated interface or excessive internal complexity. The @Generated annotation and the class purpose (meta-model for one AST node) further indicate it is intentionally minimal and modular."
