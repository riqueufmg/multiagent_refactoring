    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.PaddedNumberField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PaddedNumberField is small and highly cohesive: it has only two private final fields (field, size), a constructor that validates size, and three public methods (appendTo(Appendable, Calendar), appendTo(Appendable, int), estimateLength) implementing NumberRule. Its sole responsibility is formatting a padded numeric calendar field and it delegates digit formatting to appendFullDigits. It does not accumulate unrelated responsibilities, has a minimal interface, and is already a focused decomposition of functionality within FastDatePrinter, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
