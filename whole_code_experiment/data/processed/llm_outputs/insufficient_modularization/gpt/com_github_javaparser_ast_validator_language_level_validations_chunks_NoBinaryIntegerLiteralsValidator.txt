    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "NoBinaryIntegerLiteralsValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: it extends VisitorValidator and provides two visit overrides (IntegerLiteralExpr, LongLiteralExpr) that delegate to a single private static validate method which contains the binary-literal check. There are no fields, no large public interface, and the responsibility is singular (detect/report binary integer literals). Given its concise implementation and single cohesive concern, there is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or multiple responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
