        "FileSystemView concentrates many distinct responsibilities in one class, indicating insufficient modularization. It handles path resolution and view semantics (workingDirectory, getWorkingDirectoryPath, lookUp/lookUpWithLock, toRealPath), directory stream creation and SecureDirectoryStream handling (newDirectoryStream), file creation and type-specific creation (createDirectory, createSymbolicLink, createFile, getOrCreateRegularFile, lookUpRegularFile, getOrCreateRegularFileWithWriteLock, open), deletion and delete-related checks (deleteFile, delete, checkDeletable, checkEmpty, DeleteMode enum), linking and symbolic link operations (link, readSymbolicLink), copying/moving with complex locking and attribute-copy semantics (copy, AttributeCopyOption handling, lockSourceAndCopy, unlockSourceAndCopy, checkMovable, checkNotAncestor, lockBoth), and attribute/view access (getFileAttributeView, readAttributes, setAttribute)."
