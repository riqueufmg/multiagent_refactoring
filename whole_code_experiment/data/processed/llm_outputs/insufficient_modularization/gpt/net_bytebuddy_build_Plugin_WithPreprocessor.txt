    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Plugin.WithPreprocessor is a small, focused interface that declares a single responsibility: void onPreprocess(TypeDescription typeDescription, ClassFileLocator classFileLocator). It simply extends Plugin to mark plugins that require a preprocessing callback. The interface has no additional methods, fields, or large/cohesive implementations; therefore it is adequately modular and does not concentrate unrelated responsibilities."
