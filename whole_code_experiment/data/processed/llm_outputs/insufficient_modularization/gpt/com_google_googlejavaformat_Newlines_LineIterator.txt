    "justification": [
        "The class is cohesive and focused: all public APIs (count, firstBreak, isNewline, hasNewlineAt, getLineEnding, guessLineSeparator, containsBreaks, lineOffsetIterator, lineIterator) are concerned only with newline/line-handling.",
        "Iterator implementations are encapsulated as small private static nested classes (LineOffsetIterator, LineIterator), keeping related behavior localized rather than indicating a need to split responsibilities.",
        "The implementation is concise and methods are single-purpose; there is no evidence of a large, bloated interface or unrelated responsibilities that would justify decomposing the class further."
