    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Ownership enum is small and cohesive, modeling a single abstraction (member ownership) with exactly two constants (MEMBER, STATIC). It contains a single private field (mask) and a minimal set of focused methods (getMask(), getRange(), isDefault(), isStatic()). It also cleanly implements the ModifierContributor interfaces (ForField, ForMethod, ForType) to integrate with the modifier framework. There are no large methods, mixed responsibilities, or a bloated interface that would indicate inadequate decomposition."
