        "The Initializer class has a single, well-defined responsibility: to implement a ByteCodeAppender that creates an initializer segment determining AccessController availability (implements ByteCodeAppender, holds instrumentedType and name).",
        "Its public surface is small and cohesive: a constructor, apply(MethodVisitor, Implementation.Context, MethodDescription) and an abstract helper onAccessController(MethodVisitor) that delegates variant behavior.",
        "Variant behavior is factored into two tiny nested strategy classes (WithProperty and WithoutProperty) that only implement onAccessController; these are small and focused, avoiding mixing unrelated concerns in Initializer itself.",
        "Related but separate responsibilities (method wrapping/visitor logic and signature mapping) are implemented in other nested classes (AccessControlWrapper, PrefixingMethodVisitor) and static fields, so Initializer does not concentrate unrelated functionality.",
        "Overall the class size, structure and clear separation of the strategy implementations indicate adequate modularization rather than a bloated, multi-responsibility abstraction."
