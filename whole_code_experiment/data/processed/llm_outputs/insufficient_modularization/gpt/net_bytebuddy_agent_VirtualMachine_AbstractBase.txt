    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AbstractBase is minimal and cohesive: it defines only three small delegating convenience methods (loadAgent(String), loadAgentPath(String), loadAgentLibrary(String)) that forward to the corresponding overloaded methods with a null argument. It contains no fields, no large method implementations, and does not concentrate multiple unrelated responsibilities. Larger, complex functionality (ForHotSpot, ForOpenJ9, Connection implementations, native dispatchers, etc.) is implemented in separate nested classes and interfaces, so the abstraction is already decomposed and not bloated."
