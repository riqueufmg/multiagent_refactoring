    "justification": "ArrayFill is a small, focused utility class whose purpose is a single responsibility: provide fluent-style wrappers around array-filling operations. Although it contains multiple overloaded methods (one per primitive type and a generic variant), each method is tiny and delegates to java.util.Arrays.fill or a simple loop for the failable generator. The class has no state, a private constructor to prevent instantiation, low cyclomatic complexity, and cohesive API surface. There is no evidence of excessive size, mixed responsibilities, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient decomposition."
