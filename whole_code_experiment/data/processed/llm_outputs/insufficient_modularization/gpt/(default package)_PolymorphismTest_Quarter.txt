    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Quarter is a small, focused inner class that implements the Coin interface with a single method deposit() which increments the static moneyBox by 25. It has one clear responsibility, a minimal interface (no extra fields or methods), and low complexity/size. There is no evidence of a bloated interface, multiple unrelated responsibilities, or excessive size in this class, so Insufficient Modularization is not present."
