    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ParameterManifestation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a small, focused enum that models a single concern (whether a parameter is final). It declares only two constants (PLAIN, FINAL), a single private field (mask), and four simple methods (getMask, getRange, isDefault, isFinal). There is no evidence of multiple responsibilities, large size, or a bloated interface—its API is minimal and cohesive—so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
