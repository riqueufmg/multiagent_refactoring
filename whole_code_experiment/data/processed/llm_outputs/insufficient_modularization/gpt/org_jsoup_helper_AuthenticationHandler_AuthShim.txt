        "The class is small and focused: it primarily implements authentication delegation (getPasswordAuthentication), holds minimal state (auth, attemptCount, handler), and defines a small AuthShim interface and a compact GlobalHandler fallback.",
        "There is a clear modular boundary: AuthShim abstracts per-request vs global behavior, and the static initializer/reflection delegates loading of a RequestAuthHandler implementation when available, demonstrating separation of concerns rather than a bloated single class.",
        "Nested GlobalHandler is concise (manages a ThreadLocal and installs the system Authenticator) and encapsulates Java 8 fallback behavior; it does not introduce an excessive interface or unrelated responsibilities.",
        "No large number of unrelated methods or fields are present; the behavior and responsibilities are cohesive and appropriately decomposed for this purpose."
