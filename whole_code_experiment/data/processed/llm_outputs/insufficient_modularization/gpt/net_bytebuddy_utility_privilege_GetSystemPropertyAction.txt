    "justification": "The class is minimal and highly cohesive: it encapsulates a single responsibility (reading a system property as a PrivilegedAction). It contains one final field (key), a single-argument constructor, and one run() method that delegates to System.getProperty(key). There is no excessive size, no bloated interface, and no mixed responsibilities that would warrant decomposition."
