    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed type is a tiny, single-responsibility enum used to represent an illegal/cannot-cache variant. It contains a single INSTANCE and only three small methods (cached(), isValid(), apply()) that immediately delegate to Illegal.INSTANCE. It does not accumulate many fields, large methods, or unrelated responsibilities; caching behavior is factored via the CanCache interface and other behaviors are implemented in nested classes (ForMethod, ForConstructor, PrivilegedLookup, CachedMethod, CachedConstructor) of the enclosing MethodConstant. Therefore this type is cohesive and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
