    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "LatentMatcher.ForRecordComponentToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: it contains a single private final field (RecordComponentDescription.Token token), a single constructor, and a single resolve(TypeDescription) method that delegates to ElementMatchers.named(token.getName()). It implements one clear responsibility (resolving a record component token to a matcher) and does not accumulate unrelated functionality, large interface, or excessive complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
