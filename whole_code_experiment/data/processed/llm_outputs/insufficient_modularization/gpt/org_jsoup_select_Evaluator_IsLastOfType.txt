    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Evaluator.IsLastOfType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Evaluator.IsLastOfType is a minimal, focused inner class: it only defines a constructor that calls the superclass (IsNthLastOfType) with fixed parameters and an overridden toString(). It delegates behavior to the superclass and does not contain large methods, multiple responsibilities, or a bloated interface. While the outer Evaluator class hosts many inner evaluator types, this specific class is small and cohesive, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
