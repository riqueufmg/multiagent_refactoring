    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FieldManifestation is a small, cohesive enum modeling a single concern (a field's manifestation). It defines only three constants (PLAIN, FINAL, VOLATILE), one private final field (mask), a constructor, and a small set of closely related accessors/predicates (getMask, getRange, isDefault, isFinal, isVolatile, isPlain). All members directly relate to representing and querying the final/volatile state using Opcodes.ACC_FINAL and Opcodes.ACC_VOLATILE. There is no evidence of bloated interface, unrelated responsibilities, or excessive size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
