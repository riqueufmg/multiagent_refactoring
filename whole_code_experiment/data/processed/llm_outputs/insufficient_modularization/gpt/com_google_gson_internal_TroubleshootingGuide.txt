    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "This class is small and cohesive: it contains a single static method (createUrl) that performs one well-defined task (constructing a troubleshooting URL) and a private constructor to prevent instantiation. There are no additional fields, no large or bloated interface, and no multiple responsibilities concentrated in the class. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
