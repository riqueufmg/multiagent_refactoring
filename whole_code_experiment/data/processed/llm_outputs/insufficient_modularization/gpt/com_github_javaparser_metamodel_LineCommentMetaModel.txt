        "Class is tiny and generated: contains only a single constructor and no additional fields or methods, indicating a narrow, well-defined responsibility.",
        "It delegates initialization to the superclass (CommentMetaModel) and does not aggregate multiple unrelated responsibilities or a large interface.",
        "No signs of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface; the class exists solely to represent metadata for a specific node type (LineComment) within the metamodel package.",
        "Being generator-produced (note @Generated and header comment) further suggests modular generation of one class per node type rather than manual accumulation of responsibilities."
