    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "TypeProxy.SilentConstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The SilentConstruction enum has a single, well-defined responsibility: produce an Implementation that constructs an instance without invoking a constructor via the ReflectionFactory. Its public API is minimal (prepare and appender) and it delegates the detailed byte-code emission to a single nested static Appender class. The Appender's many constants and the apply(MethodVisitor, ...) method are cohesive to the specific task of emitting reflection-based construction byte code. There is no evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities, a bloated interface, or unrelated functionality concentrated in this class, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
