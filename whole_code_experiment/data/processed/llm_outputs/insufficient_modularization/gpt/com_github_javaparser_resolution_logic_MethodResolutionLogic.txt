    "justification": [
        "The class is very large and mixes many distinct responsibilities: method applicability checks (isApplicable overloads), type variable substitution (substituteDeclaringTypeParameters, substituteTypeVariables), type inference (inferTypes), method selection and ambiguity resolution (findMostApplicable, findMostApplicableUsage, isMoreSpecific), variadic argument grouping (groupTrailingArgumentsIntoArray, groupVariadicParamValues), and small utilities (distinctByKey).",
        "Several very long, complex methods with high branching and different concerns: isApplicable(...) handles name checking, variadic grouping, lambda checks, type-parameter matching and wildcard tolerance all in one method; substituteDeclaringTypeParameters and substituteTypeVariables perform deep recursive type-substitution logic; isMoreSpecific contains many rules for specificity comparison. These indicate multiple orthogonal responsibilities that should be separated.",
        "There is duplicated or overlapping logic across methods: two separate isApplicable implementations (one for ResolvedMethodDeclaration and one for MethodUsage) perform similar parameter/variadic/type-parameter processing, suggesting extractable shared components; findMostApplicable and findMostApplicableUsage duplicate selection heuristics.",
        "The class depends on many domain types (ResolvedType, ResolvedMethodDeclaration, MethodUsage, TypeSolver, etc.) and implements detailed algorithms for different phases of method resolution; this coupling and concentration of algorithms increases maintenance difficulty and argues for splitting into cohesive modules (e.g., applicability checking, type substitution/inference, specificity comparison, variadic handling).",
        "Presence of many TODOs and UnsupportedOperationExceptions inside this large class further shows it is a growth point for multiple concerns rather than a narrowly focused abstraction, supporting the detection of insufficient modularization."
