    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "MutableFloat",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class encapsulates a single primitive field (private float value) and exposes a focused set of operations directly related to a mutable float abstraction: constructors, getters/setters (getValue/setValue/toFloat), arithmetic operations (add/subtract, increment/decrement and their get/and variants), numeric conversions (intValue, longValue, floatValue, doubleValue), comparisons and identity methods (compareTo, equals, hashCode), and float-specific checks (isNaN, isInfinite). All methods are cohesive and pertain to the single responsibility of providing a mutable wrapper for a float. The class is small and contains no unrelated responsibilities (no I/O, persistence, UI, or unrelated utilities), so there is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
