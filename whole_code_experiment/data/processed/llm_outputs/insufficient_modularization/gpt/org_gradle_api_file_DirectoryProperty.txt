        "The interface is small and focused: it declares a limited set of directory-related methods (getAsFile, getAsFileTree, dir, set) in addition to extending Provider<Directory>.",
        "All methods are cohesive and pertain to the single abstraction of a directory property (accessing as file/fileTree, deriving subdirectories, setting the value).",
        "There is no sign of a bloated API or mixed responsibilities; functionality is delegated to related types (Provider, FileTree, File), indicating appropriate decomposition.",
        "Package context (org.gradle.api.file) matches the class responsibility, so no modularization boundaries appear violated."
