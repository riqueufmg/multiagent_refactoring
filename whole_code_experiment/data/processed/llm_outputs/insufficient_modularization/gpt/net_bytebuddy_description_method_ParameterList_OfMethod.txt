    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ParameterList.OfMethod is small and focused: it only defines a constructor that delegates to its superclass ForLoadedExecutable and a single get(int) method that returns a ParameterDescription.ForLoadedParameter.OfMethod instance. It does not contain excessive size, complex logic, or multiple unrelated responsibilities; shared behavior and complexity are encapsulated in the ForLoadedExecutable superclass and other nested classes. Therefore it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
