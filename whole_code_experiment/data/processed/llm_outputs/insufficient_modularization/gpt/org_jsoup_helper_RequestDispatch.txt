        "The class is small and focused: one static field (clientConstructor), a static initialization block, and a single get(Request, Response) method.",
        "It has a single responsibility (selecting/creating the appropriate RequestExecutor) and delegates actual request handling to HttpClientExecutor or UrlConnectionExecutor, so concerns are separated.",
        "No large/bloated interface or many unrelated methods/fields are present; the reflection-based loading of HttpClientExecutor is a lightweight optional-integration mechanism, not evidence of poor decomposition.",
        "There is clear modularization: concrete executors encapsulate transport-specific behavior and RequestDispatch acts only as a factory/dispatcher."
