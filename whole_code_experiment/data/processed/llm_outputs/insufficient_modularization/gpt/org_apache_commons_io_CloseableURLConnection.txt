    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "CloseableURLConnection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility: adapt/decorate a URLConnection to be AutoCloseable. It is final, holds one field (urlConnection), and contains minimal logic (constructors/open methods and close() which calls IOUtils.close). All other methods are simple delegations to the underlying URLConnection to preserve the URLConnection API. The apparent size comes from required pass-through overrides rather than multiple unrelated responsibilities or mixed abstractions, so this is not an instance of insufficient modularization."
