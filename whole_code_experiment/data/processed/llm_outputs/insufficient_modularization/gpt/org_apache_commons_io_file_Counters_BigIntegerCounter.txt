    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Counters",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Counters class bundles multiple distinct abstractions and concrete implementations in a single top-level class: it declares two public interfaces (Counter, PathCounters), an abstract helper (AbstractPathCounters), and four concrete Counter implementations (BigIntegerCounter, LongCounter, NoopCounter) plus three PathCounters implementations (BigIntegerPathCounters, LongPathCounters, NoopPathCounters) together with many factory methods (bigIntegerCounter, longCounter, noopCounter, bigIntegerPathCounters, longPathCounters, noopPathCounters). This concentrates several responsibilities (interface definitions, multiple implementations, factories, and path-specific aggregation) in one class rather than separate, focused modules. The number of nested classes and factory methods and the blended roles (API surface + multiple implementations + singleton instances) indicate the class is larger and less modular than ideal, making it harder to understand, test, and extend. Examples: BigIntegerCounter and LongCounter are full implementations that could be standalone classes; AbstractPathCounters + its concrete PathCounters variants similarly represent a separate abstraction that could be extracted. These facts justify the detection of Insufficient Modularization."
