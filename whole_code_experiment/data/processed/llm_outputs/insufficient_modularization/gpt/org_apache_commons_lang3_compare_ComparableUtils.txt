    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ComparableUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ComparableUtils is small and cohesive: it provides a focused responsibility (translating Comparable.compareTo results to boolean checks and producing Predicate factories). The nested static ComparableCheckBuilder encapsulates related comparison operations (between, betweenExclusive, equalTo, greaterThan, greaterThanOrEqualTo, lessThan, lessThanOrEqualTo) used by the factory methods (is, between, betweenExclusive, gt, ge, lt, le). The two additional methods (min, max) are thin delegations to ObjectUtils and are consistent with the class' concern for Comparable helpers. There is no evidence of a large, bloated interface or unrelated responsibilities that would justify decomposing this class further."
