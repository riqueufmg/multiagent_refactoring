    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Instantiation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a small, cohesive data holder with exactly two fields (inferenceVariable and properType), a constructor, two getters, and standard overrides (equals, hashCode, toString). There are no large methods, no tangled responsibilities, and no bloated interface or numerous unrelated members. Its responsibility is narrowly defined (pairing an InferenceVariable with a ResolvedType), so there is no evidence of inadequate decomposition or excessive size/complexity that would indicate Insufficient Modularization."
