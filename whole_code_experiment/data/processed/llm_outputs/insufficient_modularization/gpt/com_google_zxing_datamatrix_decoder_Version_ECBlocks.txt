    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Version class has a single, cohesive responsibility: representing Data Matrix version metadata and providing lookup for versions. Complex logic is minimal (constructor computes totalCodewords from ECBlocks/ECB), helper nested classes (ECBlocks, ECB) encapsulate error-correction block details and are tightly coupled to Version. buildVersions() holds static declarative data (table of known versions) rather than mixing unrelated behavior. Public API is small and focused (accessors and getVersionForDimensions). There is no evidence of excessive unrelated responsibilities, bloated interface, or high internal complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
