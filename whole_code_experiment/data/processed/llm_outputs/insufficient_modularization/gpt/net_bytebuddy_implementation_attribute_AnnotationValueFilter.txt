    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a small, focused interface with a single core responsibility: deciding whether an annotation value is relevant (isRelevant). Its API surface is minimal (one primary method) and it defines a nested Factory for creating filters per target (TypeDescription, FieldDescription, MethodDescription, RecordComponentDescription), which is a cohesive responsibility. The Default enum provides two concise, well-separated strategies (SKIP_DEFAULTS and APPEND_DEFAULTS) with trivial implementations. There are no large methods, no mixed responsibilities, and nested types are appropriate for the role, so the code does not demonstrate excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface indicative of Insufficient Modularization."
