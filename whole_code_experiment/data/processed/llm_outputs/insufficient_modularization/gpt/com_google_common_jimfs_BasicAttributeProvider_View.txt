    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The View class is small and cohesive: it has a single responsibility (implements BasicFileAttributeView), contains only a constructor and three simple methods (name, readAttributes, setTimes), and delegates file lookup and attribute creation to lookupFile() and the Attributes class. It contains no large switch statements, no multiple unrelated responsibilities, and heavier attribute logic is kept in the outer BasicAttributeProvider and the Attributes class. Therefore it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
