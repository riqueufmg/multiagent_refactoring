    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.HandleInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it defines only two private static constants (METHOD_HANDLE_NAME, INVOKE_EXACT), one private final field (methodType), a single constructor, and one apply(MethodVisitor, Implementation.Context) method. Its sole responsibility is to emit an exact MethodHandle invocation and compute the resulting stack size (it calls methodVisitor.visitMethodInsn(...) and computes size using methodType). There are no multiple responsibilities, no large/bloated interface, and no excessive internal complexity or many branches to justify decomposition. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
