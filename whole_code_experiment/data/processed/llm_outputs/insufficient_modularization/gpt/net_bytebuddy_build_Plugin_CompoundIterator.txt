        "The class is small and focused: it contains only two fields (current iterator and backlog queue), a constructor, a private forward() helper, and the three Iterator methods (hasNext, next, remove).",
        "Single responsibility: its sole responsibility is to iterate over a sequence of iterables in order; iteration and advancing logic is encapsulated in forward(), keeping concerns separated.",
        "No bloated interface or excessive complexity: it implements only Iterator<Element> and does not expose unrelated behavior or many public methods/fields.",
        "No sign of multiple responsibilities or large method bodies – methods are short and straightforward, indicating appropriate decomposition.",
        "Uses existing utilities (QueueFactory) and delegates iteration to contained iterators rather than implementing multiple roles itself."
