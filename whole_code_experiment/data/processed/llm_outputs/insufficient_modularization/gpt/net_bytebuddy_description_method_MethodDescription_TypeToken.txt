    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The TypeToken class is small and focused: it has two final fields (returnType, parameterTypes), simple accessors (getReturnType, getParameterTypes), and standard Object methods (hashCode, equals, toString). It represents a single, cohesive abstraction (erased return and parameter types) and does not contain unrelated responsibilities, large methods, or a bloated interface. Therefore it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
