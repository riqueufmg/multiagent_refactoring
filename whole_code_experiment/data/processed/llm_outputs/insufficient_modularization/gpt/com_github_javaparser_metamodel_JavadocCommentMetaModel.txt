    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "JavadocCommentMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: it only declares two constructors that delegate to the superclass (CommentMetaModel) and provides no additional fields or methods. It represents a single, narrow responsibility (meta-model for JavadocComment) and follows the project pattern of one meta-model class per AST node (package com.github.javaparser.metamodel). The file is generated (annotation @Generated and generator comment), indicating consistent, automated decomposition rather than a hand-crafted, bloated abstraction. There is no evidence of excessive size, mixed responsibilities, or a bloated interface, so Insufficient Modularization is not present."
