    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "FastDatePrinter.TwoDigitYearField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The inner class TwoDigitYearField is small and highly cohesive: it implements NumberRule and provides only three simple methods (appendTo(Appendable, Calendar), appendTo(Appendable, int), and estimateLength()) and a single static INSTANCE. Its responsibility is narrowly focused (formatting a two-digit year), it does not aggregate unrelated responsibilities, and it uses no large state or bloated interface. Therefore it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
