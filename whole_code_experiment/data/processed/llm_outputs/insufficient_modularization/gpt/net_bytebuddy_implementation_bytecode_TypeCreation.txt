    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and highly cohesive: it encapsulates a single responsibility (emitting a NEW bytecode for a given instantiable type). It has one private final field (typeDescription), a constructor, a static factory (of) that performs simple validation (rejecting arrays, primitives, abstract types), and a single apply(MethodVisitor, Implementation.Context) method that emits the NEW instruction and returns a Size. There are no large methods, no mixed responsibilities, and no bloated interface; its behavior fits a focused bytecode-generation role within the net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode package. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
