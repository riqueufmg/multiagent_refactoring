        "The class is small and focused: it implements Adapter with three public methods (info, trace, error) and a single private helper (printStackTrace).",
        "Each method has a single, cohesive responsibility (writing messages or throwable information to stdout/stderr); there is no sign of unrelated responsibilities being combined.",
        "Complex operations (formatting) are delegated to suppliers and the enclosing Log utilities (makeFormattingSupplier), reducing internal complexity.",
        "The existence of other adapters (e.g., SilentAdapter) shows concerns are already separated into distinct implementations rather than being folded into one bloated class."
