    "detection": true,
    "justification": [
        "The AbstractByteBuddyTask class is large and mixes many responsibilities: task configuration (numerous fields and getters/setters), plugin discovery and registration, class loader construction, class file locator composition, plugin factory resolution, engine construction and execution, logging, resource cleanup, and file-system utilities (deleteRecursively).",
        "The static apply(...) method is very long and performs multiple distinct concerns: discovery of plugins, resolving and instantiating Plugin.Factory instances, building a composite ClassFileLocator, configuring and applying the Plugin.Engine, error handling, and closing resources. Its long parameter list and complex internal logic indicate too many responsibilities concentrated in one routine.",
        "The class defines unrelated helper methods and nested types that could be modularized: deleteRecursively methods (file-IO utility), the ByteBuddySkippingUrlClassLoader (class loader construction/behavior), and the TransformationLogger (logging listener). These elements suggest separable responsibilities that would be clearer as small, focused classes or services.",
        "Several cohesive modules can be extracted (e.g., PluginDiscovery/Registration, PluginFactoryResolver, ClassFileLocatorBuilder, EngineConfigurator, FileDeletionUtil, and a ClassLoaderFactory). The current monolithic structure makes the class hard to understand, test, and maintain."
