        "The Prepared abstraction (FieldLocation.Prepared) is a small, focused interface with a single method: resolve(MethodDescription) — indicating a single responsibility.",
        "Concrete implementations are concise and cohesive: FieldLocation.Absolute implements Prepared to return a fixed FieldDescription with access validation; FieldLocation.Relative.Prepared implements Prepared to iterate extractors and use a FieldLocator to resolve a field.",
        "There is no bloated interface or excessive number of unrelated methods on Prepared, nor are large, unrelated responsibilities concentrated in this class; behavior is decomposed across well-scoped nested types.",
        "Given the minimal size, clear separation of concerns, and targeted responsibilities, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
