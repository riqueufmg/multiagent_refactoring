    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused on a single responsibility: adapting HistoryItem objects to list item Views. It has one field (activity), a simple constructor, and a single overridden method getView that reuses or inflates R.layout.history_list_item, extracts data from the HistoryItem/Result, and sets two TextViews (R.id.history_title and R.id/history_detail). There are no large, unrelated responsibilities, no bloated interface, and no excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient decomposition."
