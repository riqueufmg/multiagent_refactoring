    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Range class is small and cohesive: it encapsulates two Position fields (begin,end) and provides only range-related operations (constructors/factories, withX copy helpers, contains/strictlyContains/overlapsWith/isBefore/isAfter comparisons, equals/hashCode/toString, getLineCount). Fields are final and the class does not mix unrelated responsibilities (no I/O, parsing, or other domain logic). The public API surface is appropriate for the abstraction and methods are directly related to representing and querying a textual range, so there is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or concentrated unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
