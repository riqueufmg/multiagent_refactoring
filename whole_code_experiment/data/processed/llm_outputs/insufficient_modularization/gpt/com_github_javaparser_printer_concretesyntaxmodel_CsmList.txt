    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "CsmList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class concentrates multiple responsibilities in a single, relatively large method (prettyPrint) and encodes several concerns as fields (property, separatorPre, separatorPost, preceeding, following). prettyPrint contains two large, almost identical branches (property.isAboutNodes() true vs false) that duplicate logic for printing preceeding/following, handling separators and iterating the elements, differing only in how each element is printed (ConcreteSyntaxModel.genericPrettyPrint vs PrintingHelper.printToString). This duplicated branching and the presence of many related but distinct responsibilities (node-list printing vs generic collection printing, separator handling, surrounding elements) indicate the abstraction has not been decomposed into smaller, cohesive units (e.g., separate printers or extracted helper methods), so the class exhibits insufficient modularization."
