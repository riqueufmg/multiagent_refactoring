        "The class is small and focused: it defines a single private field 'discoverySet' and provides simple accessor methods 'getDiscoverySet' and 'setDiscoverySet'.",
        "It primarily implements a single responsibility: configuring a ByteBuddySimpleTask with the discovery set (see 'doConfigure(ByteBuddySimpleTask task)' and 'discoverySet(FileCollection fileCollection)').",
        "It cleanly overrides a few abstract behaviors from its superclass ('isEmptyDiscovery', 'doConfigure', 'discoverySet', 'toType') rather than accumulating unrelated functionality.",
        "No large public API surface, no multiple unrelated responsibilities, and no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
