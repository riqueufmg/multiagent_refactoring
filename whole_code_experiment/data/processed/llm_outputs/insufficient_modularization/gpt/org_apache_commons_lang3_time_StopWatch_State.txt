    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "StopWatch.State",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The State enum is small and cohesive: it only defines four constants (RUNNING, STOPPED, SUSPENDED, UNSTARTED) and three abstract query methods (isStarted, isStopped, isSuspended) with constant-specific implementations. It encapsulates a single, well-defined responsibility (representing the running state of StopWatch) and does not contain unrelated logic, large methods, or a bloated interface. The more complex timing behavior (start/stop/suspend/resume/split, time fields, Split/SplitState, Instants) resides in StopWatch itself, so the enum is appropriately modular and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
