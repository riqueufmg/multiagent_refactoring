    "justification": [
        "The class is small and simple: TestInner has only one public method a(), a constructor, and two nested inner classes (Inner1 and Inner2) that further break behavior into smaller units. Methods a(), b(), and c() are single-purpose print methods with no complex logic or large interfaces. There are no many fields or responsibilities concentrated in TestInner itself; nested classes indicate decomposition rather than a bloated monolith. Therefore it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
