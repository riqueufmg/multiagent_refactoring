        "The class is small and focused: it has one field (compilerPath), one constructor to locate the javac executable, and a single compile(...) method to build the javac command and invoke execution.",
        "Responsibilities are cohesive: locating the compiler and preparing/running the compile command. Execution and helper tasks (e.g. runCommands, makeClassPath, getExecutableSuffix) are delegated to the superclass, indicating good separation of concerns.",
        "There is no large public API, no many unrelated methods or fields, and no evidence of multiple independent responsibilities concentrated in this class, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
