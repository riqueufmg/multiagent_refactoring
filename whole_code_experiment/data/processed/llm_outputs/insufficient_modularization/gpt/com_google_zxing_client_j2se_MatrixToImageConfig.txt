        "No bloated interface or excessive responsibilities: only constants, two immutable fields, a helper to choose a BufferedImage type, and a private transparency check.",
        "Methods are concise and directly related to the single responsibility of representing image color configuration; there is no mixture of unrelated concerns that would justify decomposition.",
        "Package context (client.j2se) indicates this is a configuration/utility class used by MatrixToImageWriter, appropriate as a lightweight, single-purpose object."
