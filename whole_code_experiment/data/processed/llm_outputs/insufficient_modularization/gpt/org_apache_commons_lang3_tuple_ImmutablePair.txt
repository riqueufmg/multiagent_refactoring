    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive, representing a single, well-defined abstraction (an immutable pair). It only contains two final fields (public final L left; public final R right;), a constructor, simple accessors (getLeft(), getRight()), one unsupported mutator (setValue() throws UnsupportedOperationException), and a few related static factory/helpers (of(...), ofNonNull(...), nullPair(), left(), right(), emptyArray(), of(Map.Entry)). There is no evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities, excessive size, or a bloated interface that would justify decomposition. The presence of related factory methods and constants is appropriate for this single responsibility, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
