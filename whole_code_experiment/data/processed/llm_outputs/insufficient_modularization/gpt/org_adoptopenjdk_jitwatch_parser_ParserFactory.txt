    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ParserFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: it has a private constructor and a single static factory method getParser(ParserType, IJITListener) that selects and instantiates concrete parser classes (HotSpotLogParser, J9LogParser, ZingLogParser) via a switch. There are no large fields, no many responsibilities, and no bloated interface or excessive complexity indicative of insufficient modularization. While the switch hard-codes known parser types (requiring edits to add new parsers), this is a simple factory pattern concern rather than evidence that the class itself is an insufficiently modular abstraction."
