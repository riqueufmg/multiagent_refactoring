        "Classes are very small and focused: each nested class defines a single static method returning a simple string, indicating single responsibility and low complexity (InnerClass.methodCall, InnerInnerClass.innerMethodCall, InnerInnerInnerClass.innerInnerMethodCall).",
        "No large methods, long interfaces, or many fields are present that would indicate a bloated abstraction or excessive responsibilities.",
        "Nesting depth alone does not imply insufficient modularization; the nested classes do not accumulate unrelated functionality and are invoked only to return simple values (as shown by InnerClassDotExpressions.main).",
        "Static methods reduce coupling to outer instances, and there is no evidence of tangled responsibilities or difficulty in understanding/maintaining a single oversized class."
