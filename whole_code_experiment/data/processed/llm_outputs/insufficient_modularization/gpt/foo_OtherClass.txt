    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "foo.OtherClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "OtherClass is minimal: it contains only a single nested static type (InnerClass) and has no fields, methods, or large public interface. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or multiple responsibilities that would indicate insufficient decomposition, so the Insufficient Modularization smell is not present."
