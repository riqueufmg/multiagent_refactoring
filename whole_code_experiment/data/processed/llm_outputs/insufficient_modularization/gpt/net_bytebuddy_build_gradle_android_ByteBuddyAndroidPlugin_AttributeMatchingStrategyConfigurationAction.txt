    "detection": false,
    "justification": "This class is small and single-responsibility: it contains only one method (execute) whose sole action is to register ByteBuddyDependencyRule into an AttributeMatchingStrategy via stringAttributeMatchingStrategy.getCompatibilityRules().add(ByteBuddyDependencyRule.class). It has no fields, no large interface, no branching or multiple responsibilities, and is cohesive and low in complexity, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
