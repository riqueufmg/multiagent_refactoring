    "justification": [
        "The KeyVal interface is small and focused: it declares a concise set of methods (key, value, inputStream, hasInputStream, contentType and their setters) that all relate to a single responsibility — representing a form key/value pair (optionally with an uploaded stream and content type).",
        "There is no evidence of a bloated interface or unrelated responsibilities: every method pertains to managing the key/value tuple and its associated stream/mimetype.",
        "The surrounding package (Connection and its Request/Response APIs) uses KeyVal as a dedicated type for form data (e.g. Connection.data methods), indicating proper separation of concerns rather than accumulation of unrelated functionality in this type.",
        "Given its small size, cohesive API, and single clearly defined role, the KeyVal interface does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
