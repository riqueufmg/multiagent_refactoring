    "justification": [
        "The class is narrowly focused on representing an annotation description resolved lazily: its fields (typePool, annotationType, values) and primary methods (getValue, getAnnotationType, prepare) all relate to that single responsibility.",
        "Helper functionality is encapsulated in small, tightly-coupled nested types (Loadable and UnresolvedAnnotationList) that are implementation details supporting lazy annotation loading and list representation rather than unrelated responsibilities.",
        "The class size and surface area are modest compared with other types in the file and it does not mix unrelated concerns (parsing, class extraction, generic handling, etc.), so it is cohesive and does not show evidence of being inadequately decomposed."
