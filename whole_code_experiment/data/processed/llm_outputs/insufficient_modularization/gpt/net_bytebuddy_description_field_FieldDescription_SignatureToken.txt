    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "FieldDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The FieldDescription abstraction is large and bundles many distinct responsibilities and concrete implementations that could be modularized. The interface contains multiple nested types with different roles (InGenericShape, InDefinedShape, AbstractBase, InDefinedShape.AbstractBase, ForLoadedField, Latent, TypeSubstituting, Token, SignatureToken). Responsibilities mixed into this single abstraction include: (1) signature generation and generic signature handling (getGenericSignature uses SignatureWriter, asSignatureToken, SignatureToken class), (2) reflection adaptation (ForLoadedField wrapping java.lang.reflect.Field and mapping annotations), (3) creation/representation of detached tokens (Token and its accept/ asSignatureToken methods), (4) latent/unattached field descriptions (Latent) and type substitution logic (TypeSubstituting), and (5) visibility/accessibility and modifier handling in AbstractBase (isVisibleTo, isAccessibleTo, getActualModifiers). The AbstractBase itself implements many behaviors (equals/hashCode/toString/asToken/asSignatureToken/visibility logic) making the interface heavy. These clearly separable concerns (token representation, signature handling, reflection bridging, substitution, and core field API) indicate the abstraction is not adequately decomposed and would benefit from extracting top-level classes or collaborating components to reduce size and improve cohesion."
