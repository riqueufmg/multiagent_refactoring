        "The class is very small and focused: it contains a single static Pattern (NOT_DIGITS_OR_PLUS) and one format method implementing a single responsibility — producing a display-safe telephone string.",
        "It delegates phone normalisation to ContactEncoder.formatPhone rather than embedding unrelated logic, showing proper separation of concerns.",
        "It implements a narrow interface (Formatter) and is defined as a private static inner class, indicating encapsulation and modularization of formatting behavior within the enclosing encoder.",
        "No evidence of multiple responsibilities, excessive size, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient decomposition."
