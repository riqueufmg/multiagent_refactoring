        "Methods are delegating to other components (Sort.describeOrNull, ForLoadedType.of, AnnotationReader.Delegator.ForLoadedMethodReturnType) rather than embedding unrelated logic, indicating good separation of concerns.",
        "No large number of unrelated fields, long methods, or bloated interface signatures are present; the class implements a single cohesive role (a lazy projection for a method's return type).",
        "Although defined inside a very large enclosing type, this inner class itself is well-modularized and does not demonstrate the symptoms of Insufficient Modularization (excessive size or concentrated multiple responsibilities)."
