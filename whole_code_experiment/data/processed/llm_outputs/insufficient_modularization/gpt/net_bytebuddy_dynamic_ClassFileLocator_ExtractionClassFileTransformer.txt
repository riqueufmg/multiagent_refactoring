    "justification": ["The ExtractionClassFileTransformer is small and cohesive: it defines a single purpose (capturing a class's binary representation during retransformation), with a simple state (classLoader, typeName, volatile binaryRepresentation and a DO_NOT_TRANSFORM marker), a constructor, a transform(...) method and a getter. It does not contain many unrelated responsibilities, a bloated interface, or excessive complexity; its scope and responsibilities are narrowly focused, so it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."]
