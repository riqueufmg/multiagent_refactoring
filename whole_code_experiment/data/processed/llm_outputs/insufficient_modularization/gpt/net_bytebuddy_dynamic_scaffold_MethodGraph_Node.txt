    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The MethodGraph.Node abstraction is small and cohesive: its public API consists of four focused methods (getSort, getRepresentative, getMethodTypes, getVisibility). Its nested types (Sort enum, Unresolved singleton, Simple implementation) are concise and directly related to the Node abstraction, providing canonical state and simple implementations. There is no evidence of a bloated interface or many unrelated responsibilities within this class; the larger complexity in the file is confined to other nested types (Compiler, Default, Key, Store, etc.), not to MethodGraph.Node itself."
