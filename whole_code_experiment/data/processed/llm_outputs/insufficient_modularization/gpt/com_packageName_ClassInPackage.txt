    "justification": "The class is minimal and cohesive: it declares a single trivial static method (staticMethod()) and contains no fields, no multiple responsibilities, no large or bloated interface, and no complex logic. Given this small, focused structure (package com.packageName, class ClassInPackage, method staticMethod()), there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
