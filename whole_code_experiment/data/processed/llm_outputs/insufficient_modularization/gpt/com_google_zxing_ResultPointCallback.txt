    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ResultPointCallback is a small, focused interface with a single method (foundPossibleResultPoint). It declares no fields, contains no implementation logic, and encapsulates a single responsibility (a callback for detected result points). The class surface is minimal and cohesive, so there is no evidence of excessive size, bloated interface, or multiple responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
