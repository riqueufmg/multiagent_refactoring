    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it encapsulates three final fields (symbol, bounds, annotations) and provides simple constructors, accessors (getSymbol, getBounds, getAnnotations), a static factory (of) that constructs a detached token, an accept(visitor) transformer, and standard equals/hashCode/toString. All methods relate directly to representing and manipulating a type-variable token. There is no evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities, large methods, or a bloated interface that would warrant further decomposition."
