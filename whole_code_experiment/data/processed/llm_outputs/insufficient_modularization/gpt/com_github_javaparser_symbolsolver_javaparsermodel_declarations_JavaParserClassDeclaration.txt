    "justification": [
        "The class mixes many responsibilities: AST declaration wrapping, type/method/symbol resolution, ancestor traversal, field collection and on-the-fly wrapper creation, and reference-type conversion (e.g. getAllFields, getAncestors, solveMethod/solveType/solveSymbol, toReferenceType).",
        "Contains large, complex methods implementing distinct behaviors: getAllFields (creates anonymous ResolvedFieldDeclaration wrappers), getAncestors (resolution with incomplete-list handling and exception control flow), canBeAssignedTo (class/interface assignment logic), and toReferenceType (complex type resolution including LazyType creation).",
        "Partial delegation to JavaParserTypeAdapter shows uneven decomposition: many capabilities are delegated while substantial resolution logic remains in this class, indicating responsibilities are not cleanly separated.",
        "Presence of a deprecated comment advocating moving resolution out of declarations suggests existing design already recognizes mixed responsibilities and the class is a candidate for refactoring.",
        "Overall size and varied public API (many unrelated methods) indicate the class is bloated and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, cohesive components (e.g., method resolver, type resolver/adapter, ancestor/heritance resolver, field collector)."
