    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "NamingStrategy.PrefixingRandom",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it has two private final fields (prefix, randomString), a single constructor, and a single overridden name(TypeDescription) method that composes the generated name. It encapsulates one clear responsibility (building a prefixed, randomized type name) and delegates random generation to RandomString. There is no bloated interface, no excessive branching or unrelated responsibilities, and immutability is preserved, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
