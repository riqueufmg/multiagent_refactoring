    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ObjectFactory.ForApi4CapableGradle",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: it holds two Method fields, a constructor to initialize them, and a single newInstance(...) method that performs reflection and exception mapping. Its responsibility is narrowly scoped (invoking Gradle's ObjectFactory via reflection). Related alternative behavior is separated into Dispatcher.ForLegacyGradle. There is no evidence of excessive size, multiple unrelated responsibilities, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
