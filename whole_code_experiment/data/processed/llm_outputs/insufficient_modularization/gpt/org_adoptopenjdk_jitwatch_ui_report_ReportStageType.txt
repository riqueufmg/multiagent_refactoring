    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a small enum with four constants (SUGGESTION, ELIMINATED_ALLOCATION, ELIDED_LOCK, INLINING), contains no fields or methods, and represents a single, cohesive concept (report stage types). Its size and interface are minimal and focused; there is no evidence of concentrated, mixed responsibilities or excessive complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization. The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report further supports that this enum is an appropriate, modular abstraction for UI reporting stages."
