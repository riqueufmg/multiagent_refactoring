    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "LazyInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive, focused solely on lazy initialization. It contains a single volatile state field (object), the core get() method implementing double-checked locking, simple lifecycle methods (isInitialized, getTypedException) and small constructors. Complexity and concurrency/error-handling responsibilities are delegated to the AbstractConcurrentInitializer base class and to the nested Builder for construction. There is no large or unrelated set of responsibilities, no bloated public API, and no excessive branching or numerous unrelated methods that would indicate insufficient decomposition."
