    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: it is auto-generated (@Generated) and only contains a constructor that delegates to the superclass and a single PropertyMetaModel field (expressionPropertyMetaModel). It extends StatementMetaModel and does not accumulate unrelated responsibilities, large interfaces, or excessive complexity. Therefore it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
