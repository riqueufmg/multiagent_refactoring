    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "CollectionTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused on a single responsibility: serializing and deserializing Collection<E> instances. It contains only two fields (elementTypeAdapter, constructor), a simple constructor, and two compact methods (read and write) that implement collection I/O using clear, short loops and straightforward control flow. Construction concerns are delegated to ObjectConstructor and instance type handling is delegated to TypeAdapterRuntimeTypeWrapper in the factory, indicating proper separation of concerns between the factory and the adapter. There is no evidence of a bloated interface, excessive methods, or mixed responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
