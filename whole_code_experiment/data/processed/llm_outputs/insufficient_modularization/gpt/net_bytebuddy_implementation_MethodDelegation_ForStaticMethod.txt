    "class": ["MethodDelegation.ForStaticMethod"],
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MethodDelegation.ForStaticMethod is small and focused: it has a single responsibility (precompiling static method delegation records). It contains one field (records), a constructor, a static factory method (of), and two simple lifecycle methods (prepare and compile) that delegate to a compiled representation. There is no sign of a bloated interface, mixed responsibilities, or excessive size/complexity in this class; its behavior is cohesive and well-encapsulated, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
