    "justification": "The class is an interface with minimal method declarations. The implementation complexity is distributed across multiple nested classes (AbstractBase, ForLoadedRecordComponent, Latent, TypeSubstituting, Token), each with clear, cohesive responsibilities. The interface hierarchy (InGenericShape, InDefinedShape) provides appropriate abstraction levels. No single class exhibits excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
