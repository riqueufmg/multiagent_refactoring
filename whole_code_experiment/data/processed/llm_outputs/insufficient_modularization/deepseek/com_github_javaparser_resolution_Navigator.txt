    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a large utility class with 28 static methods performing diverse navigation tasks across the AST (finding classes, interfaces, enums, methods, fields, constructors, nodes, parents, switches, returns, variables, etc.). It lacks decomposition into smaller, cohesive abstractions, concentrating many unrelated responsibilities into a single class with a bloated interface, violating the Single Responsibility Principle."
