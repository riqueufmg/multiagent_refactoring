    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a well-decomposed interface hierarchy with clear separation of concerns. It defines a core interface with minimal methods (getMask, getRange, isDefault) and uses nested marker interfaces (ForType, ForModule, ForField, ForMethod, ForParameter) to separate modifiers by target element type. The Resolver inner class is cohesive and focused on modifier resolution. The abstraction is appropriately granular with no excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
