    "justification": "The analyzed class is a simple enum constant (NoOp.INSTANCE) implementing the AsmVisitorWrapper interface with minimal, single-responsibility methods that only return input values unchanged. The interface AsmVisitorWrapper defines the abstraction, and NoOp is a small, focused implementation without excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
