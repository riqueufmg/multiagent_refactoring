    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity by combining multiple distinct responsibilities: (1) main decorator logic, (2) multiple nested proxy interfaces (ModuleDescriptor, ModuleLayer, ModuleFinder, etc.), (3) two abstract base classes (AbstractModuleReader and AbstractModuleFinder), and (4) complex nested enum factories with bytecode generation logic. The class contains 9 nested interfaces and 2 abstract classes, making it overly large and difficult to maintain."
