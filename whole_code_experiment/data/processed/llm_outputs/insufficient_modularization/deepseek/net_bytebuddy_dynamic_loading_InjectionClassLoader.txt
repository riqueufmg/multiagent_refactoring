    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is appropriately sized and focused on a single responsibility: managing class injection for a class loader. It maintains minimal state (AtomicBoolean sealed), provides a clear public interface for injection operations, and delegates the core implementation to an abstract method. The nested Strategy enum is small, cohesive, and directly related to the class's purpose."
