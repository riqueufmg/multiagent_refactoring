    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small, focused, and has a single responsibility: executing the javac compiler. It inherits common process behavior from AbstractProcess and implements only the ICompiler interface. The class contains minimal state (compilerPath) and one primary method (compile) that constructs a command list and delegates execution. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
