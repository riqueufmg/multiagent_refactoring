    "justification": "The interface is small and focused with only three core methods for registering accessors, getters, and setters. The nested enum AccessType is a simple, cohesive grouping of visibility-related constants. The nested Illegal enum is a standard null-object implementation pattern. The class exhibits high cohesion and a minimal, well-defined interface without excessive size, complexity, or bloated responsibilities."
