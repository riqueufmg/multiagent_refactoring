    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The VirtualMachine interface and its nested classes (ForHotSpot, ForOpenJ9) contain excessive size and complexity with over 2000 lines of code. The class combines multiple responsibilities including platform-specific implementations (Windows, POSIX, Solaris, OpenJ9), connection management, security attribute handling, semaphore operations, and native library bindings. The ForHotSpot.Connection interface alone contains multiple nested classes (ForJnaPosixSocket, ForJnaWindowsNamedPipe, ForJnaSolarisDoor) with their own complex implementations, creating a deeply nested structure that violates the Single Responsibility Principle and demonstrates inadequate decomposition."
