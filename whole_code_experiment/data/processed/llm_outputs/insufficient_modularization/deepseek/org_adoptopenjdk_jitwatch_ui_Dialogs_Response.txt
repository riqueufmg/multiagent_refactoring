    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.Dialogs",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Dialogs class is a utility class that centralizes multiple distinct dialog creation responsibilities (showYesNoDialog, showYesNoDialogNever, showTextInputDialog, showOKDialog) with significant code duplication. It handles UI layout, event handling, and business logic for different dialog types without separating these concerns into smaller, cohesive classes. The class has a bloated interface with four public static methods and contains nested class Dialog, indicating it manages multiple abstractions that could be decomposed into specialized dialog classes."
