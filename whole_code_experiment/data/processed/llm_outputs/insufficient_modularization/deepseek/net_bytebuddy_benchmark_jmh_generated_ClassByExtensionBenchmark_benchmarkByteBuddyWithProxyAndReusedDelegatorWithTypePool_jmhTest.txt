    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 256 padding fields and multiple large, repetitive benchmark methods (Throughput, AverageTime, SampleTime, SingleShotTime) that share similar structure but are not decomposed. It handles multiple responsibilities including benchmark execution, result collection, timing logic, and thread coordination without adequate separation into cohesive abstractions."
