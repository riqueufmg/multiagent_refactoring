    "class": "com.google.gson.Gson",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Gson class is a central facade that orchestrates JSON serialization/deserialization through delegation to specialized components. It maintains a clear single responsibility as the main entry point, while complex logic is delegated to TypeAdapterFactory implementations, TypeAdapters, and other internal classes. The class size is justified by its role as a configuration holder and coordinator, not by monolithic implementation of all serialization logic."
