    "justification": "The class combines multiple responsibilities: barcode pattern detection, character decoding, pattern validation, counter management, and result assembly. It has 7 private methods and 1 public method, with complex algorithms like validatePattern, toNarrowWidePattern, and setCounters all in one class. The decodeRow method is long (over 80 lines) and handles multiple phases of decoding without separation into distinct abstractions."
