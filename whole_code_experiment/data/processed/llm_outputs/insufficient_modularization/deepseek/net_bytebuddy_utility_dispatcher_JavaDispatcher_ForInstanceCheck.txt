    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 1200 lines) and complexity, combining multiple responsibilities: proxy creation logic, security manager checks, method resolution, bytecode generation, multiple nested annotation definitions, and several inner classes (Dispatcher implementations, ProxiedInvocationHandler, DynamicClassLoader with its own nested interfaces and classes). It handles both reflection-based and bytecode-based proxy generation, manages module system compatibility, and contains numerous static inner classes and enums that could be separate top-level classes. The bloated interface includes factory methods, annotation processing, and complex conditional logic spanning hundreds of lines in the run() method."
