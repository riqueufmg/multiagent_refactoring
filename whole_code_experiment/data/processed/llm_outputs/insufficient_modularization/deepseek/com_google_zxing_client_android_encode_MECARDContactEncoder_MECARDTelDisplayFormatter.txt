    "justification": "The class is adequately decomposed with three private static nested classes (MECARDFieldFormatter, MECARDTelDisplayFormatter, MECARDNameDisplayFormatter) each handling specific formatting responsibilities. The main class focuses on coordinating the encoding process, resulting in a cohesive and appropriately sized abstraction."
