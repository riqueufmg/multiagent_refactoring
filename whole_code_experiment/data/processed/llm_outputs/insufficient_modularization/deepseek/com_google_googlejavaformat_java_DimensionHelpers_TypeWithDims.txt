    "justification": "The class is small and focused, containing only a data container (TypeWithDims) and static helper methods for processing array dimensions. It has a single responsibility, minimal complexity, and a narrow interface. The static methods are cohesive and operate on the specific domain of array dimension extraction and reordering."
