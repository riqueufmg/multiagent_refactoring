    "justification": "The class delegates all formatting responsibilities to FastDatePrinter and all parsing responsibilities to FastDateParser, maintaining a single responsibility of providing a thread-safe facade. It has moderate size, low complexity, and a focused interface that doesn't concentrate multiple responsibilities."
