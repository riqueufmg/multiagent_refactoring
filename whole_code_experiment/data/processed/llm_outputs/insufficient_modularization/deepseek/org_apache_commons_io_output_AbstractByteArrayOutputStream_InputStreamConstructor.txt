    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.AbstractByteArrayOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is appropriately modularized for its abstraction of a growable byte array output stream. It uses abstract methods for subclass variations, encapsulates buffer management in cohesive methods, separates concerns between public API and protected implementations, and maintains a focused responsibility for byte array output operations."
