    "class": "ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor has a single public method 'extract' that is excessively long and complex, performing multiple responsibilities including mapping correspondences between elements, finding indices in NodeText, and managing iterator modifications. It contains two large private helper methods (getCorrespondanceBetweenNextOrderAndPreviousOrder and findIndexOfCorrespondingNodeTextElement) that are also complex and tightly coupled to the main logic. The class lacks decomposition into smaller, more focused abstractions, concentrating algorithmic logic for diff element processing in one place."
