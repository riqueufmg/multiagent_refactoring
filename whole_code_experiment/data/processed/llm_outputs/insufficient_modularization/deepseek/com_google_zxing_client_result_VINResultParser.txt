    "justification": "The class is focused on a single responsibility (parsing VIN barcodes), has a small interface (one public method), and its private static methods are cohesive helpers for VIN validation and decoding. The class size and complexity are appropriate for its purpose, with no evidence of excessive responsibilities or bloated interface."
