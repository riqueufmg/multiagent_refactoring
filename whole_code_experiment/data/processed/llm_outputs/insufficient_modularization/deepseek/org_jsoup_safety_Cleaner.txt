    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Cleaner class combines multiple responsibilities: document cleaning, validation, HTML parsing, and visitor-based node traversal. It contains 3 public methods and 4 private methods/classes, with the CleaningVisitor inner class handling complex traversal logic. The createSafeElement method manages attribute filtering, special-case handling for anchor tags, and enforced attributes, resulting in a class with high complexity (over 200 lines) that could be decomposed into separate classes for validation, cleaning traversal, and safe element construction."
