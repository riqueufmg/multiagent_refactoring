    "justification": "The analyzed class TypeList.Empty is a small, focused class implementing an empty type list. It has minimal methods (toInternalNames, getStackSize, asGenericTypes) that are specific to its single responsibility. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface, and it represents a well-decomposed abstraction within the TypeList hierarchy."
