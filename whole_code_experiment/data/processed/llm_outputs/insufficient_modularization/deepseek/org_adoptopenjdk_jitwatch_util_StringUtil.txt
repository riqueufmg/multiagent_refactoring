    "justification": "The class is a focused utility class with 28 static methods that all operate on strings. It demonstrates high cohesion by grouping related string manipulation functions (formatting, padding, parsing, conversion, wrapping, etc.) under a single, well-defined abstraction. The class is not excessively large or complex, and its interface is not bloated; each method has a clear, single responsibility within the domain of string utilities."
