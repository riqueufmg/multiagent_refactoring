    "class": "JimfsInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is focused and cohesive, implementing only InputStream functionality for Jimfs files. It has a single responsibility (reading from a RegularFile), manageable size (~100 lines), and a minimal interface (standard InputStream methods plus internal helpers). No evidence of excessive complexity, bloated interface, or mixed responsibilities that would require decomposition."
