    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility: encapsulating Data Matrix version information. It is appropriately decomposed with two focused inner classes (ECBlocks and ECB) to handle error-correction block details. The class size is primarily due to the static table of version constants, which is necessary data rather than excessive logic. The interface is minimal, containing only getters and one static lookup method."
