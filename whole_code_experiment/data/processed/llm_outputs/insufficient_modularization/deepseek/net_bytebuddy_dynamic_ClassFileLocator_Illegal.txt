    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The interface ClassFileLocator contains 12 inner classes and 2 inner interfaces (Resolution, NoOp, MultiReleaseAware, Simple, ForClassLoader, ForModule, ForJarFile, ForModuleFile, ForFolder, ForUrl, ForInstrumentation, PackageDiscriminating, Filtering, Compound) that implement various strategies for locating class files. These inner classes represent distinct responsibilities (e.g., reading from JAR files, folders, class loaders, modules, instrumentation) that could be separated into their own top-level classes to reduce the size and complexity of the main interface. The interface acts as a container for multiple independent abstractions, leading to excessive size and a bloated interface."
