    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Unloaded",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a massive interface (DynamicType) with over 2000 lines of code, containing numerous nested interfaces (Builder, ModuleDefinition, FieldDefinition, MethodDefinition, etc.) that represent distinct responsibilities. It exhibits excessive size and complexity, combining type building, module definition, field definition, method definition, record component definition, and file I/O operations into a single abstraction. The bloated interface includes hundreds of methods, indicating a lack of decomposition into smaller, cohesive abstractions."
