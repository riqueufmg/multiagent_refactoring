    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class demonstrates high cohesion and appropriate decomposition. It cleanly separates configuration concerns into distinct final fields, uses a Builder pattern to manage complex construction, and provides static factory methods for common configurations. The class size is justified by its role as a comprehensive configuration container with immutable state, and the Builder inner class effectively handles the complexity of object creation without bloating the main class interface."
