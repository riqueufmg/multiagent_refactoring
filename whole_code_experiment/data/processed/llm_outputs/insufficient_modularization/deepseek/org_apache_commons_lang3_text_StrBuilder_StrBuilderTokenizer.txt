    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "StrBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The StrBuilder class exhibits excessive size and complexity with over 200 methods, including numerous append variants, insert methods, replace operations, and search functions. It contains three inner classes (StrBuilderReader, StrBuilderTokenizer, StrBuilderWriter) that could be separate classes, and it implements multiple interfaces (CharSequence, Appendable, Serializable, Builder<String>). The class combines responsibilities for string building, tokenization, I/O operations, and text manipulation, resulting in a bloated interface and high complexity that could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
