    "justification": "The class demonstrates good modularization through decomposition into cohesive inner classes and enums (Appender, PrefixResolver interface with Default enum and ForFixedValue class, ValueConsumer enum). Each component has a single responsibility: PrefixResolver handles prefix generation, Appender handles bytecode generation, ValueConsumer handles type-specific string conversion. The class size is justified by its comprehensive toString implementation functionality."
