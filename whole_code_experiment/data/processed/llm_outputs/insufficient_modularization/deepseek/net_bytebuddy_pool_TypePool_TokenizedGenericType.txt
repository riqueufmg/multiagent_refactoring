    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is part of a large interface hierarchy with well-decomposed abstractions. TypePool is an interface with multiple nested classes (Resolution, CacheProvider, Default, etc.) that separate concerns. TokenizedGenericType is a nested class within Default.LazyTypeDescription that handles generic type tokenization with clear single responsibility. The codebase shows extensive use of inner classes, interfaces, and delegation patterns to manage complexity."
