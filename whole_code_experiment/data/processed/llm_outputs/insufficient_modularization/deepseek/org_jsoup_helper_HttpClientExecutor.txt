    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "HttpClientExecutor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of executing HTTP requests via HttpClient. It maintains a focused interface with core methods execute(), client(), responseBody(), and safeClose(). Supporting methods like requestBody() and StatusMessage() are static helpers directly related to the main responsibility. The nested ProxyWrap class encapsulates proxy selection logic appropriately. The class size is moderate and complexity is contained to HTTP execution concerns without mixing unrelated responsibilities."
