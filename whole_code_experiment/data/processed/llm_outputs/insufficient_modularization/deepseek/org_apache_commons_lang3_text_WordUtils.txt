    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class contains 13 public static methods performing diverse string operations (capitalization, uncapitalization, case swapping, word extraction, word wrapping, word checking) with multiple overloaded variants, all concentrated in a single utility class without decomposition into more cohesive abstractions. The class exhibits high complexity with methods like wrap() having 70+ lines and intricate logic, and it mixes unrelated responsibilities such as word boundary detection, case transformation, and line wrapping algorithms."
