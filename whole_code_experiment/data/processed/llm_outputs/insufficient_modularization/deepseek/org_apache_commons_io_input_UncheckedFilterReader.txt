    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedFilterReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility: wrapping a FilterReader to convert IOException to UncheckedIOException. It delegates all operations to the parent class via Uncheck utility methods, maintaining minimal size (under 100 lines) and low complexity. The nested Builder class is a standard pattern for object construction and doesn't add excessive responsibility."
