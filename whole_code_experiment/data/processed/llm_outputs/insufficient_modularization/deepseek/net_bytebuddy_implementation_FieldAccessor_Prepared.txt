    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 11289 characters, containing multiple nested interfaces (FieldLocation, FieldNameExtractor, PropertyConfigurable, AssignerConfigurable, OwnerTypeLocatable) and inner classes (Absolute, Relative, ForBeanProperty, ForFixedValue, ForImplicitProperty, ForSetter with multiple subclasses). It handles field location strategies, field name extraction, assigner configuration, property configuration, and multiple setter implementations within a single abstraction, concentrating responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive units."
