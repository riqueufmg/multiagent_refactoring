    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small, focused, and cohesive, implementing only the immutable pair abstraction. It has minimal fields (left, right), a simple constructor, and basic getters. Static factory methods are simple utilities for creating instances. The class extends Pair and overrides only necessary methods, maintaining a single responsibility without excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
