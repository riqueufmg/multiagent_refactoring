    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableFloat",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is focused on a single, well-defined responsibility: providing a mutable wrapper for a float primitive. It has a minimal interface with only one field, implements standard interfaces (Number, Comparable, Mutable), and its methods are cohesive operations on that single value (get, set, add, subtract, increment, decrement). The size and complexity are appropriate for its purpose, and there is no indication of bloated interface or responsibilities that could be separated."
