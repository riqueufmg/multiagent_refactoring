    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Compound class is a focused, cohesive component with a single responsibility: combining multiple ByteCodeAppender instances. It has minimal size (one field, two constructors, one method), low complexity, and a narrow interface. The class properly delegates to contained appenders without accumulating unrelated responsibilities."
