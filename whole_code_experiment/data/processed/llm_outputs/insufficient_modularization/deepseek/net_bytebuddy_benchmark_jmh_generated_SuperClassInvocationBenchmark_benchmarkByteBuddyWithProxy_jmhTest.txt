    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithProxy_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 256 padding fields and multiple large, repetitive methods (benchmarkByteBuddyWithProxy_Throughput, _AverageTime, _SampleTime, _SingleShotTime) that share similar control flow and responsibilities. It handles benchmark execution, result collection, timing, warmup/cooldown cycles, and thread coordination within a single class, concentrating responsibilities that could be separated into cohesive abstractions for measurement, control flow, and result aggregation."
