    "justification": "The class is small and focused, with only two core fields (type and expression) and corresponding getters/setters. It implements standard AST node interfaces (NodeWithType, NodeWithExpression) and contains only necessary visitor pattern methods, cloning, and property change notifications. No excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface is present."
