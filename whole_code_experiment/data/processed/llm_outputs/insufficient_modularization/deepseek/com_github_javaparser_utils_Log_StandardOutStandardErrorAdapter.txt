    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Log class is appropriately modularized with a clear single responsibility for logging abstraction. It contains a small interface (Adapter), two concise adapter implementations (StandardOutStandardErrorAdapter and SilentAdapter), and static utility methods that delegate to the adapter. The class has low complexity, minimal methods, and a focused interface without excessive size or bloated responsibilities."
