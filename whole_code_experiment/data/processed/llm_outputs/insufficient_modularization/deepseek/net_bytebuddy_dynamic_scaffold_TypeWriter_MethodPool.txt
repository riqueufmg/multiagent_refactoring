    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a large interface with multiple deeply nested inner classes (Record, ForImplicitField, ForExplicitField, ForNonImplementedMethod, ForDefinedMethod, AccessBridgeWrapper, etc.) that handle diverse responsibilities including field and method implementation, visibility bridges, annotation defaults, and validation. It exhibits excessive size and complexity, concentrating responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions such as distinct classes for field handling, method handling, bridge generation, and validation logic."
