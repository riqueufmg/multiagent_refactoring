    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 2500 lines) and complexity, containing multiple nested interfaces and classes (MethodLocator, ArgumentLoader, TargetHandler, MethodInvoker, TerminationHandler) that could be separate classes. It has a bloated interface with numerous factory methods and configuration options, concentrating responsibilities for method invocation, argument loading, target handling, and termination handling into a single class."
