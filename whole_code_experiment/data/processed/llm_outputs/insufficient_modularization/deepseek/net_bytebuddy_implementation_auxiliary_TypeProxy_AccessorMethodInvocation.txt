    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class TypeProxy (including its inner classes) exhibits excessive size and complexity, containing multiple distinct responsibilities: (1) main proxy type definition and factory logic, (2) multiple specialized StackManipulation implementations (ForSuperMethodByConstructor, ForSuperMethodByReflectionFactory, ForDefaultMethod), (3) nested InvocationFactory interface with enum implementations, (4) MethodCall implementation with nested Appender and AccessorMethodInvocation classes, (5) SilentConstruction enum with nested Appender class, and (6) AbstractMethodErrorThrow enum. These represent separate concerns that could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
