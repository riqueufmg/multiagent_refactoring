    "justification": "The interface and its nested classes are well-decomposed with clear responsibilities: FieldDescription defines the core abstraction, InGenericShape and InDefinedShape provide specialized views, AbstractBase offers common implementations, ForLoadedField handles reflection, Latent handles detached fields, TypeSubstituting handles type substitution, Token represents detached field properties, and SignatureToken provides lightweight identification. Each component has a single, cohesive purpose without excessive size or complexity."
