    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter$Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is excessively large (over 4800 lines) and complex, containing multiple nested interfaces (FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool) and inner classes (ForCreation, ForInlining, ValidatingClassVisitor, etc.) that could be separated into distinct abstractions. It handles diverse responsibilities including type validation, ASM visitor delegation, field/method/record component processing, and class file dumping, resulting in a bloated interface and high cognitive load."
