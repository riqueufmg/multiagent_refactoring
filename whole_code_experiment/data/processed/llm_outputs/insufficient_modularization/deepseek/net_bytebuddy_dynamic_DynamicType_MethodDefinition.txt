    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is an interface with 1,630+ lines and defines 15+ nested interfaces (Builder, ModuleDefinition, InnerTypeDefinition, TypeVariableDefinition, FieldDefinition, MethodDefinition, RecordComponentDefinition, etc.) that collectively represent a bloated abstraction for building dynamic types. It exhibits excessive size, complexity, and a bloated interface with over 200 methods, concentrating responsibilities for type, field, method, constructor, record component, module, and type variable definitions that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
