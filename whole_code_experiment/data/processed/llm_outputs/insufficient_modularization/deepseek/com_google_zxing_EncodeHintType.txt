    "justification": "The class is a simple enum that defines encoding hint constants for a barcode library. It has a single responsibility: to enumerate possible hint types. The class is not excessively large (22 constants), has low complexity (no methods or logic), and does not have a bloated interface. Each constant is well-documented but does not introduce separate responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller abstractions."
