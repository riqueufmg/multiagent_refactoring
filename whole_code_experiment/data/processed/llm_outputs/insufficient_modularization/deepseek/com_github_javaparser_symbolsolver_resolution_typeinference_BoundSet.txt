    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "BoundSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 300+ lines, handling multiple responsibilities including bound management, constraint derivation, dependency analysis, and resolution algorithms. It contains numerous private helper methods (findPairSameAs, forEachPairSameAs, forEachPairSameAndSubtype, forEachPairSubtypeAndSubtype, findPairsOfCommonAncestors, buildAllSubsetsOfSize, allSetsWithProperty, etc.) that could be separated into dedicated classes. The deriveImpliedBounds and performResolution methods are overly long and complex, implementing multiple algorithm steps that could be modularized. The class also manages multiple bound types (SameAsBound, SubtypeOfBound, CapturesBound, FalseBound) and their interactions without proper separation of concerns."
