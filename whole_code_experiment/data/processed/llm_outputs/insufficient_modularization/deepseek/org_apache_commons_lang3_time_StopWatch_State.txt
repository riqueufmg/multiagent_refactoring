    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The StopWatch class demonstrates adequate modularization through: 1) Clear single responsibility for timing operations, 2) Well-defined internal enums (State, SplitState) and inner class (Split) that decompose state management, 3) Cohesive methods focused on timing lifecycle (start, stop, suspend, resume, split, unsplit), 4) Consistent abstraction level without unrelated responsibilities, 5) Reasonable size for a utility class with comprehensive timing functionality."
