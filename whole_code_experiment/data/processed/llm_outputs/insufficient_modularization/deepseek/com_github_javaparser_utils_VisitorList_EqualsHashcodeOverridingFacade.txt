    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class VisitorList has a single, well-defined responsibility: implementing a List that uses custom equals/hashCode visitors. It delegates storage to a simple inner list and uses a small inner class solely to wrap elements with the custom equality logic. The class size is moderate, complexity is low, and the interface is not bloated beyond the required List implementation. No evidence of excessive responsibilities or lack of decomposition."
