    "justification": "The Evaluator class is adequately decomposed into a cohesive abstract base class with numerous small, focused static nested classes (Tag, Id, Class, Attribute, etc.), each representing a single CSS selector evaluation rule. The class follows the Composite pattern effectively, with clear separation of concerns and no excessive size or bloated interface."
