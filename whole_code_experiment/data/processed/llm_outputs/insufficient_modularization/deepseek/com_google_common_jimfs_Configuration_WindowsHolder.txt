    "justification": "The class exhibits high cohesion with a single responsibility of configuring an in-memory file system. It uses a Builder pattern to manage numerous configuration options, separating construction logic from the immutable value object. The class size is justified by the comprehensive configuration needs, and it shows adequate decomposition through nested holder classes for platform-specific defaults."
