    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small, focused, and cohesive, with a single responsibility of adapting java.sql.Time for JSON serialization/deserialization. It has minimal fields, a concise interface, and its complexity is inherent to the required synchronization for DateFormat thread-safety, not due to lack of decomposition."
