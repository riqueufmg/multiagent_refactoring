    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The interface MethodGraph contains multiple nested interfaces, enums, and classes (Node, Linked, Compiler, NodeList, Simple) with extensive implementations, totaling over 1400 lines. The Compiler.Default class alone is highly complex, containing inner interfaces Harmonizer and Merger, abstract class Key with nested Harmonized and Detached classes, class Store with nested Entry hierarchy (Initial, Resolved, Ambiguous), and class Graph. This concentration of diverse responsibilities (method graph representation, compilation, harmonization, merging, key management, node resolution) within a single interface file indicates inadequate decomposition into separate, cohesive abstractions."
