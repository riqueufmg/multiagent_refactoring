    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 7000 lines), high complexity with multiple deeply nested inner classes (WithoutSpecification, Substitution, Replacement, etc.), and a bloated interface with numerous public methods. It concentrates multiple responsibilities including member matching, substitution logic, byte code generation, and delegation handling that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. The class contains multiple large inner classes (Substitution.Chain, ForDelegation) that themselves contain extensive nested structures, indicating inadequate decomposition of the core abstraction."
