    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 2000 lines) and complexity, containing multiple nested interfaces, enums, and inner classes (InvocationProvider, ArgumentProvider, NameProvider, ReturnTypeProvider, TerminationHandler, WithImplicitArguments, WithImplicitTarget, WithImplicitType, Appender). It handles diverse responsibilities including bootstrap method configuration, argument provisioning, dynamic invocation, lambda expression creation, and bytecode generation, which could be separated into more cohesive abstractions. The bloated interface with numerous factory methods (bootstrap, lambda) and configuration methods (withBooleanValue, withByteValue, etc.) further indicates insufficient decomposition."
