    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReversedLinesFileReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class contains 285 lines of code with multiple responsibilities: file reading logic, line reversal algorithm, encoding handling, and iterator implementation. It includes a large inner class FilePart (103 lines) that handles block management and line parsing, which could be a separate class. The main class also manages charset detection, newline sequence handling, and multiple deprecated constructors, indicating a bloated interface and excessive complexity."
