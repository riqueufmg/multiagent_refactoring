    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is excessively large (11247 characters) and complex, containing multiple nested classes (ForLifecycleTypes, ForExplicitLocations, ForDependencyFolder, MavenBuildLogger, TransformationLogger, Transformer, Coordinate, StalenessFilter, FilePrefixMatcher) that handle distinct responsibilities such as different transformation targets, logging, filtering, and coordinate management. It has a bloated interface with numerous configuration parameters and abstract methods, concentrating responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
