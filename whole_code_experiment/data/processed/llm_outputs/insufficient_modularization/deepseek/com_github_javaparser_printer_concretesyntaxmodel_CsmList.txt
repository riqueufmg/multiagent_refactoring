    "justification": "The class is focused on a single responsibility: formatting lists of elements in a concrete syntax model. It has a clear, cohesive purpose with a small, well-defined interface (five fields, two constructors, one core method). The prettyPrint method handles two related cases (NodeList and Collection) in a straightforward manner without excessive complexity or branching. The class size is small and does not exhibit bloat or multiple unrelated responsibilities."
