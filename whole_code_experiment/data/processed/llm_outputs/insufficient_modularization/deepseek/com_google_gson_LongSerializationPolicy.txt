    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a small, focused enum with only two instances (DEFAULT and STRING), each implementing a single abstract method 'serialize'. It has minimal complexity, a clear single responsibility (defining long serialization policies), and does not exhibit excessive size, bloated interface, or multiple responsibilities that would require decomposition."
