    "justification": "The class is an interface with 66814 characters and over 5000 lines, containing multiple deeply nested inner interfaces and classes (Generic, Visitor, AnnotationReader, OfNonGenericType, OfGenericArray, OfWildcardType, OfParameterizedType, OfTypeVariable, LazyProxy, Builder, etc.). It handles numerous responsibilities including type representation, generic type handling, type variable resolution, annotation processing, type validation, type substitution, and visitor pattern implementations. The interface defines 100+ methods and contains extensive inner type hierarchies, indicating excessive size, complexity, and a bloated interface that could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
