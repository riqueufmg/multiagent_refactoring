    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 4896 characters, containing multiple nested classes (Initializer.WithProperty, Initializer.WithoutProperty, AccessControlWrapper, PrefixingMethodVisitor) and a large static initialization block. It handles multiple responsibilities including plugin configuration, bytecode generation, method weaving, and annotation processing, which could be separated into more cohesive abstractions."
