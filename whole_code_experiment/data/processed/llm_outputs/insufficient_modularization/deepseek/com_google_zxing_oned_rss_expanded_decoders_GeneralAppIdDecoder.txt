    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity by combining multiple distinct responsibilities: numeric, alphanumeric, and ISO/IEC 646 decoding logic; state management via CurrentParsingState; bit array value extraction; and multiple latch detection methods. It has 14 private methods handling different decoding modes and conditions, resulting in low cohesion and a bloated interface for a single abstraction."
