    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class delegates all context management responsibilities to a separate ExceptionContext component (DefaultExceptionContext), maintaining a single responsibility as a runtime exception with contextual capabilities. It has moderate size (under 100 lines), minimal complexity, and a focused interface that only adds context-handling methods to standard RuntimeException behavior."
