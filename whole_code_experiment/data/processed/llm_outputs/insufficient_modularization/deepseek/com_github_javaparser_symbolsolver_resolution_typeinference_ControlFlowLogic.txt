    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity by attempting to implement the entire JLS 14.21 reachability and normal completion logic in a single class. It contains multiple large visitor implementations (canCompleteNormally, isReachable) with many unimplemented cases, handles diverse statement types (break, continue, if, switch, while, do, for, try, synchronized), and mixes control flow analysis for different constructs without separation of concerns."
