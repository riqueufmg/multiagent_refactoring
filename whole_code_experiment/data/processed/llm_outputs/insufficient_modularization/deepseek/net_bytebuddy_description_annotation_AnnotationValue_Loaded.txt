    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a large interface (over 2000 lines) that contains multiple nested classes and enums (RenderingDispatcher, Loaded, State, Sort, ForConstant, ForAnnotationDescription, ForEnumerationDescription, ForTypeDescription, ForDescriptionArray, ForMissingType, ForMismatchedType, ForMissingValue, ForIncompatibleType) with diverse responsibilities including value representation, loading, filtering, rendering, and error handling. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and demonstrates excessive size and complexity that could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
