    "justification": "The class combines multiple responsibilities: UI component construction (list view, checkboxes, context menus), event handling for mouse clicks and menu actions, data filtering logic, listener management, and intrinsic analysis string formatting. It contains 7 inner event handlers, 2 context menu builders, and data processing methods like findIntrinsicsUsedByMember, resulting in high complexity and low cohesion."
