    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Connection interface is excessively large and complex, containing 200+ methods across multiple nested interfaces (Connection, Base, Request, Response, KeyVal). It combines responsibilities for HTTP session management, request configuration, response handling, data parameter management, and progress tracking into a single abstraction. The interface has a bloated API with numerous configuration methods, data methods, and execution methods, making it difficult to understand and maintain. The abstraction has not been adequately decomposed into smaller, more cohesive units."
