    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a simple enum with only two values (PLAIN, FINAL), minimal methods (getMask, getRange, isDefault, isFinal), and a single field. It has a clear single responsibility (representing final/non-final parameter state), low complexity, and a focused interface. No evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would require decomposition."
