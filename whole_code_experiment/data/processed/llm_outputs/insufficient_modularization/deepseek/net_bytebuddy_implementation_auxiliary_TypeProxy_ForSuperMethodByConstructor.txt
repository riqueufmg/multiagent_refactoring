    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class TypeProxy is excessively large (5780+ characters) and contains multiple nested classes (ForSuperMethodByConstructor, ForSuperMethodByReflectionFactory, ForDefaultMethod, MethodCall, SilentConstruction, AbstractMethodErrorThrow) and an interface (InvocationFactory) within a single file. It handles multiple distinct responsibilities: creating type proxies via different mechanisms (constructor-based, reflection-based, default method), implementing bytecode appenders, and managing method invocation logic. These responsibilities could be separated into smaller, more cohesive classes."
