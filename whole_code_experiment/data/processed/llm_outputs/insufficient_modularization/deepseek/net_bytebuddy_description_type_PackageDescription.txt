    "justification": "The interface PackageDescription is well-decomposed with a clear single responsibility of representing Java packages. It defines a minimal interface with only essential methods (contains, isDefault, getName, getDeclaredAnnotations). The abstract base class provides shared implementations, while concrete implementations (Simple, ForLoadedPackage) handle specific cases. The class has low complexity, focused interface, and appropriate separation of concerns without excessive size or bloated interface."
