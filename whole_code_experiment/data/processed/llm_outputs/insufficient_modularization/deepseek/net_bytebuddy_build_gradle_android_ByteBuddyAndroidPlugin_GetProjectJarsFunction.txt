    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class contains multiple nested classes (VariantAction, RuntimeClassPathResolver, ByteBuddyTransformationConfiguration, VariantConfigurationConfigurationAction, AttributeContainerConfigurationAction, AttributeMatchingStrategyConfigurationAction, ConfigurationConfigurationAction, ByteBuddyDependencyRule, TransformationDispatcher, ByteBuddyViewConfiguration) that handle distinct responsibilities such as variant processing, classpath resolution, configuration actions, dependency rules, and transformation dispatching. These responsibilities could be separated into independent classes rather than being nested within the main plugin class, reducing complexity and improving cohesion."
