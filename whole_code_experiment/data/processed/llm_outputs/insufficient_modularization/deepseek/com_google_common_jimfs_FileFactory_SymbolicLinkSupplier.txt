    "justification": "The class is focused on a single responsibility: creating file system objects (directories, regular files, symbolic links) and providing suppliers for them. It has a small, cohesive interface with only essential public methods. The inner supplier classes are simple and directly related to the factory's purpose. The class size is moderate and complexity is low, with no evidence of bloated interface or mixing unrelated responsibilities."
