    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Evaluator class is excessively large (over 1000 lines) and contains 38 inner classes, representing numerous distinct CSS selector evaluation strategies. It exhibits high complexity and low cohesion by bundling unrelated evaluators (tag, attribute, pseudo-class, text matching) into a single monolithic abstraction. The class has a bloated interface with many public static inner classes, and responsibilities could be separated into smaller, more cohesive modules."
