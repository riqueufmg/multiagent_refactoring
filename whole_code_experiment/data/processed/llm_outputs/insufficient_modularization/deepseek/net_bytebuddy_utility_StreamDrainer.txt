    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of draining InputStreams into byte arrays. It maintains low complexity with one core method, minimal state (only bufferSize), and a focused interface. The class is small, cohesive, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate inadequate decomposition."
