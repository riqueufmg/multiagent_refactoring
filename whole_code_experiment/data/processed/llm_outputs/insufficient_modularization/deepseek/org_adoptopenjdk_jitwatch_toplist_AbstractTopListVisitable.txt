    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is abstract and serves as a base implementation for building top lists. It has a single primary responsibility (building sorted lists via tree traversal), minimal state (model, list, sort flag), and a focused interface. The size is small, complexity is low, and there is no evidence of bloated interface or multiple responsibilities that need decomposition."
