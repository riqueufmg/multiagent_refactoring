    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "FastDateParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FastDateParser is excessively large (8922 characters) and contains multiple nested classes (CaseInsensitiveTextStrategy, CopyQuotedStrategy, ISO8601TimeZoneStrategy, NumberStrategy, PatternStrategy, Strategy, StrategyAndWidth, StrategyParser, TimeZoneStrategy) that handle distinct parsing responsibilities. It combines pattern parsing, strategy management, locale handling, timezone processing, and date calculation logic within a single class, resulting in high complexity and a bloated interface with 100+ methods and fields. The class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by managing both high-level parsing coordination and low-level strategy implementations."
