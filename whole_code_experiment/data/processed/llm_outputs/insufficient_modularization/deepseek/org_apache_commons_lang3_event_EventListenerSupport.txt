    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "EventListenerSupport",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class demonstrates adequate modularization with clear separation of concerns: it encapsulates listener management in a dedicated class, delegates invocation logic to inner ProxyInvocationHandler, separates serialization concerns into private methods, and maintains a focused interface for listener operations. The class size and complexity are appropriate for its single responsibility of managing and firing events to multiple listeners."
