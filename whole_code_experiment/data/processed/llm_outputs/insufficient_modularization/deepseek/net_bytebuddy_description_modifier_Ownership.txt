    "justification": "The class is a simple enum with only two values (MEMBER and STATIC). It implements multiple interfaces but has minimal, cohesive functionality: a mask field, getMask(), getRange(), isDefault(), and isStatic(). The class is small, focused on representing ownership modifiers, and shows no signs of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
