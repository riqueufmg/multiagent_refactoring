    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity by combining multiple responsibilities: token management, error recovery, range calculation, node list manipulation, lambda expression generation, array creation, type juggling, and parse exception message formatting. It has a bloated interface with 30+ methods handling disparate concerns rather than being decomposed into smaller, cohesive abstractions."
