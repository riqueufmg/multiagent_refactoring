    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 256 padding fields and multiple large, repetitive benchmark methods (benchmarkJavassist_Throughput, benchmarkJavassist_AverageTime, benchmarkJavassist_SampleTime, benchmarkJavassist_SingleShotTime) that share similar control flow patterns. It handles multiple responsibilities including benchmark execution, result collection, timing, and thread coordination without adequate decomposition into smaller, cohesive abstractions."
