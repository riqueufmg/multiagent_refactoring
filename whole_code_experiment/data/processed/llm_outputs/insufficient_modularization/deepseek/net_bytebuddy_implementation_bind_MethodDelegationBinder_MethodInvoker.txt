    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The interface MethodDelegationBinder contains multiple nested interfaces (Record, MethodInvoker, ParameterBinding, MethodBinding, BindingResolver, AmbiguityResolver, TerminationHandler) and classes (Processor) with substantial implementations, resulting in excessive size and complexity. It concentrates responsibilities for method binding, parameter binding, ambiguity resolution, termination handling, and processing into a single abstraction, making it difficult to understand and maintain. The class exhibits bloated interface with numerous inner types that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
