    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a small, focused inner class with a single responsibility: implementing RecordComponentPool.Record for implicit record components. It has minimal size (approx. 100 lines), low complexity, and a narrow interface with only a few methods. It does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
