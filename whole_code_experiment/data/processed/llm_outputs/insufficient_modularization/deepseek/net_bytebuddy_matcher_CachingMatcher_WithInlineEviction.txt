    "justification": "The class is a small, focused inner class that extends CachingMatcher to add eviction behavior. It has a single responsibility (cache eviction), minimal complexity, and a small interface with only one overridden method. The class size is appropriate for its purpose and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
