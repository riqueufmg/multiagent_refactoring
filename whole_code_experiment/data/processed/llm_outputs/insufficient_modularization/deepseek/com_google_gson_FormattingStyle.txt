    "justification": "The class is small, focused, and cohesive, containing only three configuration fields (newline, indent, spaceAfterSeparators) and their corresponding getters and immutable builder methods. It has a single responsibility of defining JSON output formatting style, with no excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
