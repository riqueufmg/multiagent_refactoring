    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility (Reed-Solomon encoding), minimal interface (one public constructor and one public method), manageable size, and delegates polynomial operations to the GenericGFPoly class. It maintains internal state (cachedGenerators) appropriately for performance optimization without bloating its interface or complexity."
