    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class contains 8 inner classes (VariantAction, RuntimeClassPathResolver, ByteBuddyTransformationConfiguration, VariantConfigurationConfigurationAction, AttributeContainerConfigurationAction, AttributeMatchingStrategyConfigurationAction, ConfigurationConfigurationAction, ByteBuddyDependencyRule) and 2 inner interfaces (TransformationDispatcher, ByteBuddyViewConfiguration) that handle distinct responsibilities such as variant processing, classpath resolution, configuration management, and transformation dispatching. The main class also contains static initialization logic and multiple constants, resulting in a large class with high complexity and multiple concerns that could be separated into dedicated classes."
