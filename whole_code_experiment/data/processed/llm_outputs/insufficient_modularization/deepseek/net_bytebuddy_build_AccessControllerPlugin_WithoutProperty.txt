    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity by combining multiple responsibilities: plugin factory implementation, static signature mapping initialization, bytecode appender logic (Initializer), method visitor wrapper (AccessControlWrapper), and annotation definition. It contains 3 nested classes (Initializer.WithProperty, Initializer.WithoutProperty, AccessControlWrapper.PrefixingMethodVisitor) and a large static initialization block with 11 signature mappings, resulting in a bloated interface with 200+ lines of code."
