    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class exhibits strong modularization with clear separation of concerns: abstract base MethodConstant handles common logic, while nested classes ForMethod, ForConstructor, PrivilegedLookup, CachedMethod, and CachedConstructor each encapsulate specific responsibilities. The interface CanCache and enum CanCacheIllegal provide well-defined abstractions. Each component has focused responsibilities and manageable size."
