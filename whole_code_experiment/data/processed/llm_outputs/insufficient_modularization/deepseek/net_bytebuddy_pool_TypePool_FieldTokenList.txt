    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is an interface with 67304 characters and contains multiple nested classes (Simple, Illegal, NoSuchTypeException, CacheProvider, Empty, AbstractBase, Default, LazyFacade, ClassLoading, Explicit) that implement complex functionality like type resolution, caching, lazy loading, and bytecode parsing. The Default class alone contains numerous inner classes (ReaderMode, WithLazyResolution, TypeExtractor, etc.) that handle ASM-based parsing, annotation processing, generic type extraction, and lazy type descriptions, resulting in excessive size and complexity that could be decomposed into separate, more cohesive abstractions."
