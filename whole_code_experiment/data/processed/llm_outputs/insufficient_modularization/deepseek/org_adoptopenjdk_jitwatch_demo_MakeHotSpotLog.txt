    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 35 methods, many performing distinct JIT compilation demonstration tasks (e.g., addVariable, randomBranchTest, intrinsicTest, testSort, testCallChain, testLoopUnrolling). These methods lack cohesive abstraction and could be separated into smaller, focused classes (e.g., BranchTestDemo, IntrinsicDemo, SortDemo, ChainDemo). The class also has a bloated interface with numerous private helper methods (chainA1-4, chainB1-3, chainC1-3, leaf1-4) that are tightly coupled to specific demonstrations rather than representing a unified responsibility."
