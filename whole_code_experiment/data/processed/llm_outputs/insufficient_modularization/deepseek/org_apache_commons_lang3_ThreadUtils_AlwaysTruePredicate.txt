    "class": "ThreadUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ThreadUtils exhibits excessive size and complexity by combining multiple responsibilities: it contains nested predicate classes (AlwaysTruePredicate, NamePredicate, ThreadIdPredicate), deprecated custom predicate interfaces (ThreadPredicate, ThreadGroupPredicate), and numerous static methods for finding threads and thread groups with various criteria. The class also handles thread joining, sleeping, and utility operations, resulting in a bloated interface with low cohesion. These responsibilities could be separated into smaller, more focused classes such as ThreadFinder, ThreadGroupFinder, ThreadPredicateFactory, and ThreadSleepUtils."
