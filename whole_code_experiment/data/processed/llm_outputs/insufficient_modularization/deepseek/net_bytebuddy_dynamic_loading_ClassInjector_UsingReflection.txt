    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingReflection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with over 1500 lines of code, containing multiple nested interfaces and classes (Dispatcher, Direct, UsingUnsafeInjection, UsingUnsafeOverride, Unavailable) that implement similar functionality across different Java versions. It handles multiple responsibilities including reflection-based class injection, package definition, security manager checks, and compatibility with different JVM versions (Java 7+, legacy VMs). The class has a bloated interface with numerous methods and complex conditional logic for different runtime environments, concentrating responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions for each injection strategy or JVM version."
