    "class": "ObservableInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class combines multiple responsibilities: it acts as an observable input stream, manages a collection of observers, implements observer notification logic, and contains nested builder and observer classes. The class has 150+ lines with methods for observer management (add, remove, removeAllObservers, getObservers), notification methods (noteClosed, noteDataByte, noteDataBytes, noteError, noteFinished), and overridden InputStream methods with complex error handling. The Observer and Builder inner classes further increase the class's size and complexity, concentrating multiple abstractions in a single class."
