    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "AssemblyInstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of representing an assembly instruction with its components (annotation, address, prefixes, mnemonic, operands, comments). It maintains low complexity with only core data fields and related helper methods. The class size is moderate (under 200 lines) with no bloated interface, and delegation to AssemblyLabels for label formatting shows appropriate separation of concerns."
