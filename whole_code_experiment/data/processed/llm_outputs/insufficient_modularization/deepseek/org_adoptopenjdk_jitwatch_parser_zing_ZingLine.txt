    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single responsibility of representing and converting Zing log line data. It maintains cohesive state related to compilation events, provides simple getters/setters, and has only three focused conversion methods (toTagQueued, toTagNMethod, toTagTask) that operate on its own data. The class is not excessively large, complex, or bloated, and shows no signs of multiple responsibilities that need decomposition."
