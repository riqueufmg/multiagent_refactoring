    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Entities",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity by combining multiple responsibilities: entity lookup (named entity validation, codepoint mapping), string escaping (with multiple escape modes, charset handling, whitespace normalization), string unescaping, data loading from serialized format, and performance optimizations (caching, thread-local buffers). It contains 200+ lines with nested enums, static methods, and complex branching logic, indicating a lack of decomposition into cohesive abstractions."
