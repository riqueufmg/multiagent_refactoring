    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 200+ lines, combining multiple responsibilities: encoding orchestration (encodeHighLevel), lookahead analysis (lookAheadTest, lookAheadTestIntern), character classification utilities (isDigit, isNativeC40, etc.), minimum calculation logic (findMinimums, getMinimumCount), and numeric digit counting (determineConsecutiveDigitCount). It centralizes logic for six different encoding modes without proper decomposition, resulting in a bloated interface with numerous static methods and complex control flow in lookAheadTestIntern."
