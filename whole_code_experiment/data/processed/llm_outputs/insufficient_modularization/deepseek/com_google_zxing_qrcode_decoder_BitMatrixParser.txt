    "justification": "The class has a single responsibility of parsing QR code bit matrices, with well-defined methods for reading format information, version, codewords, and mirroring operations. It maintains a manageable size (~200 lines), cohesive interface focused on parsing tasks, and delegates specialized operations to separate classes like Version, FormatInformation, and DataMask."
