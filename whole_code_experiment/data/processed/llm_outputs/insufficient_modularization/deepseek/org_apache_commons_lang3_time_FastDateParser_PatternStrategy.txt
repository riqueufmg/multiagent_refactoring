    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "FastDateParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FastDateParser contains 7 inner classes (CaseInsensitiveTextStrategy, CopyQuotedStrategy, ISO8601TimeZoneStrategy, NumberStrategy, PatternStrategy, Strategy, StrategyAndWidth, StrategyParser, TimeZoneStrategy) and 16 static strategy instances, handling multiple responsibilities including parsing logic for different date/time fields, time zone handling, pattern matching, and caching. This results in excessive size (8922+ lines in context), high complexity, and a bloated interface with numerous nested abstractions that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive classes."
