    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 256 byte fields, multiple similar benchmark methods (Throughput, AverageTime, SampleTime, SingleShotTime) performing nearly identical operations, and static stub methods duplicating measurement logic. It concentrates responsibilities for different benchmark modes, result calculation, and measurement control that could be separated into cohesive abstractions."
