    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 2000 lines), high complexity with multiple nested interfaces and classes (InvocationProvider, ArgumentProvider, NameProvider, ReturnTypeProvider, Target, Resolved, TerminationHandler, WithImplicitType, WithImplicitArguments, WithImplicitTarget, AbstractDelegator, Appender), and a bloated interface with numerous methods for handling different argument types (withBooleanValue, withByteValue, withShortValue, etc.). It concentrates responsibilities for dynamic method invocation, argument provisioning, type handling, and bytecode generation that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
