    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The AbstractBase class is small and focused, implementing only two concrete methods (findVariable and findExpectedVariable) that provide default implementations for the interface. It delegates appropriately to abstract methods and other components. The interface TypeVariableSource defines a clear abstraction for type variable sources with cohesive methods, and the abstract base class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
