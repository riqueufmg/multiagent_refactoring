    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.Dialogs",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Dialogs class contains multiple static methods implementing different dialog types (showYesNoDialog, showYesNoDialogNever, showTextInputDialog, showOKDialog) with significant code duplication in UI construction and event handling. It mixes dialog creation logic, layout management, and event handling in single methods without separating concerns into cohesive abstractions. The class acts as a utility class with excessive responsibilities rather than having specialized dialog classes."
