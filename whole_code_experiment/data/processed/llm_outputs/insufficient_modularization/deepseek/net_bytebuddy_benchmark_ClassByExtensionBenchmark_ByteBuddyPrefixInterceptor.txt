    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 20+ fields and 20+ methods, combining multiple responsibilities including benchmark orchestration, class loading, interceptor implementations, and multiple delegation strategies. It contains three inner classes (ByteBuddyProxyInterceptor, ByteBuddyAccessInterceptor, ByteBuddyPrefixInterceptor) that could be separate classes, and the main class handles multiple distinct benchmarking scenarios (ByteBuddy, cglib, Javassist) with repetitive code patterns, indicating inadequate decomposition of responsibilities."
