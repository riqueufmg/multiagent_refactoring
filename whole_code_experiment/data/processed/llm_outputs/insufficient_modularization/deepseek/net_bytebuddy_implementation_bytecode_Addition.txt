    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a simple enum with a single responsibility: representing addition operations for different primitive types. It has minimal size (four enum constants), low complexity, and a focused interface implementing StackManipulation. The abstraction is appropriately decomposed, with no indication of excessive responsibilities or bloated interface."
