    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Plugin interface and its nested types (Factory, Engine, Source, Target, Dispatcher, etc.) are all defined within a single file, resulting in excessive size and complexity. The class file is over 34000 characters long and contains multiple distinct abstractions (plugin factories, plugin engines, sources, targets, dispatchers, listeners, error handlers) that could be separated into their own cohesive modules. The interface has a bloated responsibility scope, encompassing plugin definition, factory creation, engine orchestration, I/O handling, parallel execution, and error management."
