    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class is a nested interface (LazyInterfaceList) within the large TypeDescription interface. While TypeDescription itself is extremely large and complex, LazyInterfaceList is a small, focused component that serves a specific purpose within the visitor pattern implementation. It has a single responsibility (representing lazy interface lists) and is appropriately decomposed from the main TypeDescription abstraction."
