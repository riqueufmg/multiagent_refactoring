    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 5 nested classes/enums (SilentConstruction, AbstractMethodErrorThrow, InvocationFactory, ForSuperMethodByConstructor, ForSuperMethodByReflectionFactory, ForDefaultMethod, MethodCall) and 2 additional nested classes (Appender, AccessorMethodInvocation). It combines multiple responsibilities including proxy creation, bytecode generation for different construction strategies, method invocation handling, and serialization support. The class has 5 fields and 2 public constructors, with a bloated interface containing 7 public static nested types and multiple public static final fields."
