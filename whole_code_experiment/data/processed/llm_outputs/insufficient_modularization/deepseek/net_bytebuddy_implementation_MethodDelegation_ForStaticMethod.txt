    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation$ForStaticMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity by containing multiple nested classes (ForStaticCall, ForField, ForMethodReturn, ForConstruction, WithInstance, WithLookup, ForMethodReturn, ForConstruction) and interfaces (ImplementationDelegate, Compiled) within a single file. It handles diverse delegation scenarios (static methods, field access, method return values, constructors) with distinct logic, resulting in a bloated interface and high cognitive load. The class concentrates responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions for each delegation type."
