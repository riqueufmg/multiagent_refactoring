    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small, focused, and cohesive. It has a single responsibility (creating a type instantiation stack manipulation), minimal interface (one factory method and one inherited abstract method), and low complexity. No evidence of excessive size, bloated interface, or multiple responsibilities that need decomposition."
