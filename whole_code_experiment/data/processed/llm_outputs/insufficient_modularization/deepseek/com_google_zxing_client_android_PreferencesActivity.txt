    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused, containing only constant declarations for preference keys and a simple onCreate method that delegates UI setup to a fragment. It exhibits high cohesion by concentrating solely on activity initialization and preference key definitions, with no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
