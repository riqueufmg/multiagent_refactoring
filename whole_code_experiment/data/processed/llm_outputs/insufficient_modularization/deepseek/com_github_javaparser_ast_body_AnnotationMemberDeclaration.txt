    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility representing an annotation member declaration. It maintains a small, cohesive interface with only four core properties (modifiers, type, name, defaultValue) and implements standard AST node interfaces. The class size is moderate, and all methods are directly related to managing its state and AST node behavior without excessive complexity or unrelated responsibilities."
