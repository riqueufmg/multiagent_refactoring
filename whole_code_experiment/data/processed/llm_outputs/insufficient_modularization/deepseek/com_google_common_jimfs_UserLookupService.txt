    "justification": "The class is small, focused, and cohesive. It has a single responsibility of looking up and creating user/group principals. It contains only two public methods from the parent class, two static factory methods, and three small, related inner classes that share a common base. The total size is minimal, and there is no indication of excessive complexity, bloated interface, or mixing of unrelated responsibilities."
