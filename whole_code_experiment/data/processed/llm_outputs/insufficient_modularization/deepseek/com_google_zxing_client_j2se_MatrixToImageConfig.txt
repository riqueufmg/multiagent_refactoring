    "justification": "The class is small, focused, and cohesive, containing only two fields, two constructors, three simple getters, and one internal helper method. It has a single responsibility of encapsulating color configuration and image type determination for barcode generation, with no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
