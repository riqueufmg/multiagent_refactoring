    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 400 lines) and complexity with multiple similar benchmark methods (baseline_Throughput, baseline_AverageTime, baseline_SampleTime, baseline_SingleShotTime) that share duplicated logic. It contains 256 byte fields for padding, multiple state variables, and static helper methods, concentrating responsibilities for benchmark execution, result collection, and thread coordination without decomposition into cohesive abstractions."
