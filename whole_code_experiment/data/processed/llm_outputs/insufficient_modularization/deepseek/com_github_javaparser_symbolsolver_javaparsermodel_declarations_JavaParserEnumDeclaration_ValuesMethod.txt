    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity by containing two large inner classes (ValuesMethod and ValueOfMethod) that implement full ResolvedMethodDeclaration interfaces, handling multiple responsibilities including type solving, method resolution, field resolution, and enum-specific logic. These inner classes could be separate, cohesive abstractions rather than being embedded within the enum declaration class."
