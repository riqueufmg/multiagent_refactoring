    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class is a small, focused inner class implementing the Counter interface with a single responsibility of counting using BigInteger. The outer Counters class is well-decomposed into cohesive abstractions (multiple Counter implementations, PathCounters interfaces and implementations) with clear separation of concerns and appropriate use of inner classes."
