    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The interface LatentMatcher is well-decomposed into multiple cohesive inner classes and an enum, each with a single responsibility. The inner classes (Resolved, ForFieldToken, ForMethodToken, ForRecordComponentToken, Conjunction, Disjunction) and enum (ForSelfDeclaredMethod) are small, focused, and handle specific matching scenarios. The interface maintains a consistent, minimal contract with only one method. No single class exhibits excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
