    "justification": "The class is a focused enum with a single primary responsibility: detecting Graal VM native image execution context. It has a clear public interface (getCurrent, isDefined, isNativeImageExecution, sorted) and encapsulates related helper functionality (ImageCodeContextAction, doPrivileged). The class size is moderate, and its methods are cohesive around the central abstraction."
