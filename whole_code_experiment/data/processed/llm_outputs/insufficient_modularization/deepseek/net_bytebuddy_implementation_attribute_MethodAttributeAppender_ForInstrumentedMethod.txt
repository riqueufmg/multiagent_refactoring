    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender.ForInstrumentedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is an enum with two well-defined variants (EXCLUDING_RECEIVER, INCLUDING_RECEIVER) that share a single apply method implementing a cohesive annotation appending algorithm. The class size is moderate (approx. 100 lines), has a single responsibility (appending instrumented method annotations), and delegates specialized tasks to dedicated helper classes (AnnotationAppender, AnnotationValueFilter). No bloated interface or excessive complexity is present."
