    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 28 methods and 500+ lines of code, concentrating multiple responsibilities including file lookup, creation, deletion, copying, moving, attribute management, directory operations, and symbolic link handling. It has a bloated interface with methods like createDirectory, createSymbolicLink, getOrCreateRegularFile, deleteFile, copy, link, checkAccess, readSymbolicLink, and multiple attribute methods, all in a single class that could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
