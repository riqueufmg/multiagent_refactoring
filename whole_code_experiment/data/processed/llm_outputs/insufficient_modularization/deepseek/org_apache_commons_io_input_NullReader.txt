    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of emulating a Reader with configurable size and behavior. It maintains low complexity with cohesive methods focused on reader emulation, proper decomposition of private helper methods, and a clean interface that follows the Reader abstraction without bloated functionality."
