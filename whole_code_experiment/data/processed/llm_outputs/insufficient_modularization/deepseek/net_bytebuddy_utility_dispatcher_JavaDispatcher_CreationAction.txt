    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 1200+ lines, containing multiple nested classes (InvokerCreationAction, DirectInvoker, Dispatcher interface with 7 implementations, ProxiedInvocationHandler, DynamicClassLoader with nested Resolver interface and implementations), multiple annotations (Proxied, IsStatic, IsConstructor, Instance, Container, Defaults), and handling diverse responsibilities including proxy generation, security checks, method resolution, bytecode generation, and module system adaptation. The bloated interface and concentration of responsibilities suggest inadequate decomposition into smaller, cohesive abstractions."
