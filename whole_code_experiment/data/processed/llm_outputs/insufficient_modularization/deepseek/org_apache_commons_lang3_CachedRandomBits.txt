    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small (under 100 lines), has a single responsibility (generating random bits using a cache), contains only one public method, has minimal state (cache array, bit index, random source), and all methods are cohesive around bit generation. No evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
