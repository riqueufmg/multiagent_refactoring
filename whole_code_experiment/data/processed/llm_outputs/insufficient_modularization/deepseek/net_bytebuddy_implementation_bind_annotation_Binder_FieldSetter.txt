    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Binder class contains 7883 characters and implements multiple responsibilities: annotation property handling, proxy type validation and installation, field resolution logic, and multiple nested implementations (FieldResolver, StaticFieldConstructor, InstanceFieldConstructor, FieldGetter, FieldSetter, AccessorProxy). It exhibits high complexity with deeply nested inner classes and interfaces, performing validation, bytecode generation, and proxy creation within a single class."
