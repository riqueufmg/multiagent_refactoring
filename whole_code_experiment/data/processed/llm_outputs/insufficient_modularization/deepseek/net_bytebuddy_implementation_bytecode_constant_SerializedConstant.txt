    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility (creating stack manipulations for serialized constants), minimal interface (one public factory method and one protected constructor), and reasonable size/complexity. It properly delegates serialization logic to standard Java APIs rather than implementing it internally."
