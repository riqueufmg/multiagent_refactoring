    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "GeneratedJavaParserTokenManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with over 3,900 lines of code, containing multiple responsibilities including token management, lexical analysis, comment processing, and state machine logic. It has a bloated interface with numerous private methods for DFA state transitions (jjMoveStringLiteralDfa* methods), token processing logic, and large static data arrays (jjbitVec*). The class lacks decomposition into cohesive abstractions, concentrating lexer generation, token handling, and comment collection in a single monolithic class."
