    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 1,396 lines of code, containing multiple nested interfaces and enums (AttachmentProvider, ProcessProvider, AgentProvider, AttachmentTypeEvaluator) that represent distinct responsibilities. It handles agent attachment, instrumentation lookup, file I/O operations, manifest creation, external process execution, and platform-specific logic, all within a single class. The class has a bloated interface with numerous public static methods for various attachment scenarios, and it mixes high-level agent management with low-level implementation details like jar file creation and process execution."
