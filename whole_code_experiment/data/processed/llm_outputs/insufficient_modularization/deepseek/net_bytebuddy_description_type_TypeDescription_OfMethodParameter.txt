    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "TypeDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The TypeDescription interface and its nested interfaces/classes represent an excessively large abstraction with over 6000 lines of code. It combines multiple responsibilities including type representation, generic type handling, annotation processing, type variable management, and visitor pattern implementations. The interface defines 50+ methods and contains multiple large nested interfaces (Generic with 1000+ lines, multiple inner classes like OfNonGenericType, OfParameterizedType, OfWildcardType, OfTypeVariable, LazyProjection, Builder) that themselves contain extensive functionality. This violates single responsibility principle and demonstrates inadequate decomposition of a complex type system abstraction."
