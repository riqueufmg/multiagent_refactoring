    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.FileWriterWithEncoding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single responsibility of providing a file writer with configurable encoding. It delegates complex initialization to a helper method (initWriter) and uses a separate Builder class for construction. The multiple constructors are deprecated variants for backward compatibility, not separate responsibilities. The class size is moderate and focused on its core abstraction."
