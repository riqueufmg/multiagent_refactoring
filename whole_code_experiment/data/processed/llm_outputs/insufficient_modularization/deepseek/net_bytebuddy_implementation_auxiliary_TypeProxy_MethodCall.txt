    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class TypeProxy is excessively large (over 700 lines) and contains multiple nested classes and enums (MethodCall, SilentConstruction, InvocationFactory, ForSuperMethodByConstructor, ForSuperMethodByReflectionFactory, ForDefaultMethod, AbstractMethodErrorThrow) that each handle distinct responsibilities such as proxy creation strategies, bytecode generation, and invocation handling. This concentration of diverse functionalities within a single class results in high complexity and a bloated interface, making it difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve."
