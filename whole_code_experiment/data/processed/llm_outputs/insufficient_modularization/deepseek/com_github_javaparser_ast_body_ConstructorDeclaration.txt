    "justification": "The class is well-decomposed, inheriting core functionality from CallableDeclaration and implementing focused interfaces (NodeWithBlockStmt, NodeWithAccessModifiers, etc.). It has a single primary responsibility (representing a constructor), minimal unique fields (only 'body'), and methods are primarily simple getters/setters, delegation to parent, or generated type-casting methods. No evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
