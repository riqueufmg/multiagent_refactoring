    "justification": "The class is a small, focused inner class (ComponentTypeLocator.ForAnnotationProperty.Bound) that implements a single responsibility: lazily resolving an array's component type by querying an annotation property. It has minimal size, low complexity, and a narrow interface, showing adequate decomposition within the larger TypePool.Default hierarchy."
