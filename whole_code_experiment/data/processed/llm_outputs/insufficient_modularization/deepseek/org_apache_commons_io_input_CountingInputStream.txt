    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small, focused, and cohesive. It has a single responsibility of counting bytes read from an InputStream. It extends ProxyInputStream, inheriting core InputStream behavior, and only adds minimal counting logic (one field, simple overrides of afterRead and skip, and getter/reset methods). The class is not excessively large, complex, or bloated."
