    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is an abstract base class that properly delegates specialized behavior to concrete subclasses. It maintains a single responsibility (managing type annotations and providing type casting utilities) and has a focused interface. The numerous type-checking and casting methods are generated boilerplate for a type hierarchy and don't represent excessive complexity or lack of decomposition."
