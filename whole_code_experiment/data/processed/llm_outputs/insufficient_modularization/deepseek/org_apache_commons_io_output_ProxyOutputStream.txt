    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ProxyOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is appropriately modularized as a decorator for OutputStream with a single responsibility: delegating operations while providing hooks for extension. It has a focused interface (only essential write methods plus close/flush), moderate size, and clear cohesion. The added writeRepeat methods are logical extensions of the core delegation responsibility. The Builder inner class is appropriately nested for construction."
