    "justification": "The class is small and focused, with only three fields and minimal methods. It has a single responsibility of representing a tokenized type variable. The interface is not bloated, containing only essential constructors, factory method, getters, and standard Object method overrides. Complexity is low, with no signs of multiple responsibilities that need decomposition."
