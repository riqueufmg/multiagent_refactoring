    "justification": "The class handles multiple distinct responsibilities: applying cookies to requests (applyCookiesToRequest), converting URLs to URIs (asUri), storing cookies from responses (storeCookies), and parsing cookie strings (parseCookie). These operations lack a cohesive abstraction and could be separated into dedicated classes for request cookie handling, response cookie handling, and URI conversion."
