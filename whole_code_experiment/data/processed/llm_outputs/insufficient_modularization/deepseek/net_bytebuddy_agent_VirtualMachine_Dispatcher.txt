    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The VirtualMachine interface and its nested classes (ForHotSpot, ForOpenJ9) contain excessive size and complexity, with over 2000 lines of code. The ForHotSpot class includes multiple platform-specific connection implementations (ForJnaPosixSocket, ForJnaWindowsNamedPipe, ForJnaSolarisDoor) and their factories, each with complex native integration logic. The ForOpenJ9 class contains its own Dispatcher interface with platform-specific implementations (ForJnaPosixEnvironment, ForJnaWindowsEnvironment) and additional helper classes. The abstraction combines multiple responsibilities including protocol handling, platform-specific communication, file system operations, process management, and native library integration, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive modules."
