    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class demonstrates adequate modularization through: 1) Clear single responsibility of counting file system visits, 2) Use of builder pattern (AbstractBuilder, Builder) to separate construction logic, 3) Delegation of counting to separate PathCounters abstraction, 4) Filtering logic separated into PathFilter components, 5) Reasonable size with focused methods for directory/file visitation and counter updates, 6) Extension of SimplePathVisitor for base behavior inheritance."
