    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 2000 lines) and complexity, containing multiple nested interfaces (InvocationProvider, ArgumentProvider, NameProvider, ReturnTypeProvider, Target, Resolved), enums (TerminationHandler, ConstantPoolWrapper), and inner classes (WithImplicitArguments, WithImplicitTarget, WithImplicitType, Appender, and various ArgumentProvider implementations). It handles numerous responsibilities including bootstrap method configuration, argument provisioning, dynamic invocation target resolution, bytecode generation, and lambda expression creation, all within a single class. The bloated interface includes over 50 public methods for configuring various argument types and invocation scenarios."
