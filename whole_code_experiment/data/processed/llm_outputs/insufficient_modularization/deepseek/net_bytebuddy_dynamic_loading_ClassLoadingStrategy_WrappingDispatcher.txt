    "justification": "The WrappingDispatcher class is a small, focused inner class with a single responsibility: configuring and creating ByteArrayClassLoader instances. It has moderate size (approx. 100 lines), cohesive methods that all relate to class loader configuration, and delegates actual loading to ByteArrayClassLoader. The class represents a specific abstraction within the broader ClassLoadingStrategy interface hierarchy."
