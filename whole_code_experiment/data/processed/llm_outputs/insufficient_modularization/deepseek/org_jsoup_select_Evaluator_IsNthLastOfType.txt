    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Evaluator class is excessively large (over 1000 lines) and contains 38 inner classes, representing numerous distinct CSS selector evaluation responsibilities. It exhibits high complexity with multiple inheritance hierarchies (CssNthEvaluator, IndexEvaluator, AttributeKeyPair) and handles diverse concerns including tag matching, attribute matching, text content matching, structural pseudo-classes, and index-based selectors. The class has a bloated interface with many public inner classes and concentrates responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
