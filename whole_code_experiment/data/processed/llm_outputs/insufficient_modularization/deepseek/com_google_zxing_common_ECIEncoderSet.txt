    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ECIEncoderSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class combines multiple responsibilities: static initialization of global encoder list, complex construction logic for determining needed encoders, and direct encoding operations. It has excessive size and complexity with a large constructor containing nested loops and conditional logic for encoder selection. The class handles both encoder set management and character encoding operations, which could be separated into distinct abstractions."
