    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a large interface (over 2000 lines) containing multiple nested classes, enums, and interfaces (RenderingDispatcher, Loaded, State, Sort, ForConstant, ForAnnotationDescription, ForEnumerationDescription, ForTypeDescription, ForDescriptionArray, ForMissingType, ForMismatchedType, ForMissingValue, ForIncompatibleType) that handle diverse responsibilities including annotation value representation, loading, filtering, rendering, and error handling. This monolithic structure concentrates responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions, resulting in excessive size and complexity."
