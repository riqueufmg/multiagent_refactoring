    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 7000 lines) and complexity, containing multiple nested classes (WithoutSpecification, Target, Substitution, Replacement, etc.) that represent distinct responsibilities. It handles field substitution, method substitution, constructor substitution, invokedynamic substitution, type pool resolution, and complex substitution chains with delegation and offset mapping. These responsibilities could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions such as dedicated classes for different substitution types, substitution chain management, and annotation-based binding resolution."
