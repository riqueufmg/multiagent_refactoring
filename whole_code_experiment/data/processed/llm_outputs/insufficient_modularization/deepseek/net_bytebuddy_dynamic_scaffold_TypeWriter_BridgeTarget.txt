    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a massive interface (TypeWriter) with multiple deeply nested inner classes and interfaces (FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool, Default, ForInlining, ForCreation, etc.) spanning over 4800 lines. It exhibits excessive size and complexity, concentrating responsibilities for class file writing, field/method/record component handling, validation, redefinition, rebasing, decoration, and creation. The abstraction has not been adequately decomposed into smaller, cohesive units, resulting in a bloated interface and difficulty in maintenance."
