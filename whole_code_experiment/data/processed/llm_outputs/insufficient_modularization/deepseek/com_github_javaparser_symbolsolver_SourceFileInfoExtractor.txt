    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "SourceFileInfoExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class combines multiple responsibilities: file system traversal, parsing, type resolution, method call resolution, result reporting, and statistics tracking. It has high complexity with multiple large methods (solve, solveMethodCalls, toString, solveTypeDecl) and manages many internal state variables (successes, failures, unsupported, printFileName, out, err, verbose). The class lacks decomposition into cohesive abstractions for separate concerns like file processing, resolution logic, and output reporting."
