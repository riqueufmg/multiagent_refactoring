    "justification": "The interface defines a single, cohesive visitor abstraction with 100+ methods, which is typical and necessary for the Visitor pattern to cover all AST node types. The size is inherent to its purpose, not due to inadequate decomposition. The interface has a single responsibility: defining visit methods for the AST hierarchy."
