    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 50+ methods, mixing multiple responsibilities including path manipulation, normalization, extension handling, wildcard matching, hostname/IP validation, and string utilities. It has a bloated interface with numerous public static methods, low cohesion evidenced by unrelated methods like IPv4/IPv6 validation and wildcard matching, and high complexity in methods like doNormalize() and getPrefixLength(). The class concentrates responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions such as PathParser, ExtensionHandler, WildcardMatcher, and HostnameValidator."
