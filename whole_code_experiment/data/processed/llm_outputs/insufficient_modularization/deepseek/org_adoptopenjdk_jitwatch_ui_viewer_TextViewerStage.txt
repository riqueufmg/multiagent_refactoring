    "justification": "The class is small and focused, extending AbstractTextViewerStage to specialize text viewing functionality. It has a single constructor that performs a cohesive task: preparing text content with optional line numbers and formatting. No excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface is present; responsibilities are appropriately delegated to the parent class via setContent()."
