    "justification": "The class is small, focused, and has a single responsibility: creating parser instances based on a type. It delegates all parsing logic to separate classes (HotSpotLogParser, J9LogParser, ZingLogParser), showing adequate decomposition. No excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface is present."
