    "justification": "The class combines UI layout construction, UI component creation, data binding, and data presentation logic within a single class. It handles creation of multiple distinct UI sections (left column, right column, compilation navigator, size info, timing info), manages numerous labels (lblCompileID, lblClass, lblMember, lblAddress, lblBytecodeSize, etc.), and directly implements data formatting and binding logic. These responsibilities could be separated into smaller, cohesive classes such as dedicated UI builders, view components, or presenter classes."
