    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class combines multiple responsibilities: plugin implementation, annotation definitions, advice resolution logic, bytecode generation, and offset mapping. It contains 3 nested types (AdviceResolver enum with inner class, CacheFieldOffsetMapping class) and handles primitive type mapping, field creation, method validation, and ASM-level bytecode manipulation. The AdviceResolver enum alone contains complex initialization logic and a nested ExitAdviceByteCodeAppender class, making the class excessively large (3838+ characters) and complex with low cohesion."
