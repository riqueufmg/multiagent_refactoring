    "class": "JavaParserJsonSerializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class combines multiple responsibilities: JSON serialization logic, token/range writing methods, and multiple inner enum definitions (JsonNode, JsonRange, JsonTokenRange, JsonToken). It has excessive size and complexity with 4 inner enums and 7 methods handling different serialization aspects, representing a bloated interface that could be decomposed into separate classes for serialization logic, property key definitions, and token/range writing."
