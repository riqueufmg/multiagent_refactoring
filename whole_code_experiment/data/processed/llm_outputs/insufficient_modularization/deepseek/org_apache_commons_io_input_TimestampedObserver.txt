    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small, focused, and cohesive with a single responsibility of tracking timestamps for an observable input stream. It has minimal fields (two instants), simple methods that operate on those fields, and a clear, narrow interface. No evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would require decomposition."
