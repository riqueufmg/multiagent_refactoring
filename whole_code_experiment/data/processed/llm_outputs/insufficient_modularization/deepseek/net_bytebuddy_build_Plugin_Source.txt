    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Plugin interface and its nested types represent a bloated abstraction with excessive size and complexity. The class contains 8 nested interfaces (WithPreprocessor, WithInitialization, Factory, Engine, TypeStrategy, PoolStrategy, ErrorHandler, Listener, Source, Target, Dispatcher) and numerous nested classes (over 50), totaling over 3400 lines. It combines responsibilities for plugin definition, factory creation, engine orchestration, source/target handling, error management, and parallel execution. The Engine.Default class alone contains over 500 lines and handles transformation orchestration, type resolution, plugin application, and resource management. This monolithic structure violates single responsibility principle and demonstrates insufficient decomposition into cohesive abstractions."
