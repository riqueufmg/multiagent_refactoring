    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "NodeFinderVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size with over 150 methods, all implementing the same repetitive pattern of traversing child nodes and applying a function. This represents a single abstraction (node finding) that has not been decomposed into smaller, more cohesive units, resulting in high complexity and maintenance burden due to massive code duplication across all visitor methods."
