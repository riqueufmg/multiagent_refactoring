    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class combines multiple responsibilities: managing Nexus access, implementing a ByteCodeAppender (InitializationAppender), and containing two complex dispatcher implementations (Available and Unavailable) with their own logic. The Dispatcher interface and its implementations are large and could be separate classes. The class has 330+ lines, indicating excessive size and complexity for a single abstraction."
