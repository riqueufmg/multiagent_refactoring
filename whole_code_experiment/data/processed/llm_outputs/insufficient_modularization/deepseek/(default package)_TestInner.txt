    "justification": "The class demonstrates appropriate modularization through nested inner classes (Inner1 and Inner2), each with distinct, cohesive responsibilities. The outer class and inner classes are small, focused, and have minimal complexity. No single class exhibits excessive size, bloated interface, or concentration of unrelated responsibilities."
