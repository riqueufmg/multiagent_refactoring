    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small, focused, and cohesive, implementing only the BasicFileAttributeView interface with three concise methods. It delegates file operations to the File object and has minimal state. The containing outer class BasicAttributeProvider appropriately separates concerns into provider, view, and attributes implementations without excessive complexity."
