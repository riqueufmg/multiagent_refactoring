    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Plugin interface and its nested types represent a massive abstraction with over 3400 lines of code, containing multiple distinct responsibilities: plugin definition, factory creation, engine orchestration, source/target handling, error handling, listeners, dispatchers, and materialization logic. The class exhibits excessive size and complexity, with deeply nested interfaces and classes (Factory, Engine, Source, Target, Dispatcher, etc.) that could be separated into independent modules. The bloated interface concentrates responsibilities that violate the Single Responsibility Principle and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, cohesive abstractions."
