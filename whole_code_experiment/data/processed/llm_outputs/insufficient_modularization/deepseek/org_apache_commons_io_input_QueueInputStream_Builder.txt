    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Builder class is small, focused on constructing QueueInputStream instances with configurable blocking queue and timeout. It has only three fields, a constructor, and three simple methods (get, setBlockingQueue, setTimeout). Its responsibilities are cohesive and minimal, serving as a dedicated builder pattern implementation without excessive complexity or bloated interface."
