    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Initial",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a massive interface (DynamicType) with over 2000 lines of code, containing numerous nested interfaces (Builder, ModuleDefinition, FieldDefinition, MethodDefinition, etc.) that represent distinct responsibilities. It exhibits excessive size and complexity, with a bloated interface that combines type building, module definition, field definition, method definition, record component definition, and type loading responsibilities. The class could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive abstractions such as separate builders for modules, fields, methods, and record components, rather than nesting them within a single monolithic interface."
