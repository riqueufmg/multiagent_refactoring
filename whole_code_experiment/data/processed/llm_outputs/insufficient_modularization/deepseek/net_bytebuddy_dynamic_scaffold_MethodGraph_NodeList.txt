    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The interface MethodGraph contains 5 nested interfaces, 8 nested classes, and 2 nested enums, totaling over 1400 lines of code. It combines multiple responsibilities including graph representation, node management, graph compilation with harmonization and merging strategies, and graph storage. The Default.Compiler class alone spans over 500 lines and contains multiple inner classes (Harmonizer, Merger, Key, Store, Entry, Graph) that could be separate top-level abstractions. The class exhibits excessive size and complexity, concentrating graph algorithms, data structures, and multiple design patterns within a single interface hierarchy."
