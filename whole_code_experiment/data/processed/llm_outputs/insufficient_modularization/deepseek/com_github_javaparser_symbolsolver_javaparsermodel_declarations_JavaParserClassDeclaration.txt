    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "JavaParserClassDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 100+ lines, handling multiple responsibilities including type resolution, method solving, field collection, ancestor computation, and type conversion. It directly manipulates AST nodes, delegates to multiple helpers (JavaParserTypeAdapter, AstResolutionUtils, SymbolSolver), and contains deprecated public methods indicating bloated interface. The class mixes declaration logic with resolution logic, violating single responsibility principle."
