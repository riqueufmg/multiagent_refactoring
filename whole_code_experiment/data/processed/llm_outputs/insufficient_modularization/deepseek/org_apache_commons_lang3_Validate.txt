    "justification": "The class contains 70+ public static methods performing diverse validation operations (null checks, empty checks, range checks, type checks, pattern matching, state validation) with significant code duplication across overloaded methods. It has a bloated interface with 20+ constant error messages and handles multiple unrelated responsibilities without decomposition into smaller, cohesive abstractions."
