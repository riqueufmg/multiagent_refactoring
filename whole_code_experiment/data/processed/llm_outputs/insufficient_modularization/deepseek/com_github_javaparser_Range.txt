    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small, focused, and cohesive, representing a single abstraction (a character range in source code). It has only two fields, a constructor, and a limited set of operations that are directly related to range manipulation (creation, modification, containment checks, and overlap detection). There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface."
