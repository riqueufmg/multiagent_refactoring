    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The interface contains 5 nested interfaces (Record, MethodInvoker, ParameterBinding, MethodBinding, BindingResolver, AmbiguityResolver, TerminationHandler) and 3 nested classes (Processor, Compound, Virtual, Anonymous, Unique, Builder, Build, StreamWriting, Default, Unique, NoOp, Directional, Compound, Default), totaling over 800 lines of code. It defines multiple complex abstractions (binding resolution, parameter binding, method invocation, termination handling) within a single interface, resulting in excessive size and complexity. The interface serves as a container for numerous responsibilities that could be separated into distinct, cohesive abstractions."
