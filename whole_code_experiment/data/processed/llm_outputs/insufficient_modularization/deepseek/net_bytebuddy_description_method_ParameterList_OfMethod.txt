    "justification": "The interface and its nested classes demonstrate appropriate decomposition: ParameterList defines a clear abstraction for parameter collections, with separate implementations for loaded executables (ForLoadedExecutable with subclasses for modern/legacy VMs), explicit lists (Explicit with ForTypes), token-based lists (ForTokens), type-substituting lists (TypeSubstituting), and empty lists (Empty). Each class has a single responsibility, manageable size, and cohesive interface."
