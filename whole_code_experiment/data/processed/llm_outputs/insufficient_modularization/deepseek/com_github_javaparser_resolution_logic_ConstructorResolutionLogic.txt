    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity by concentrating multiple responsibilities: variadic parameter handling, type compatibility checking, and constructor selection logic. It contains large methods (isApplicable with 80+ lines, findMostApplicable with 50+ lines) that perform multiple distinct operations, and lacks decomposition into smaller, cohesive helper classes or components."
