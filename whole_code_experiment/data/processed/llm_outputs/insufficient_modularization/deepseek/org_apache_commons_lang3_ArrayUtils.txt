    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with over 500 methods, handling operations for 8 primitive types and Object arrays through duplicated method patterns. It concentrates responsibilities for array manipulation (add, remove, search, sort, conversion, etc.) without decomposition into smaller, cohesive abstractions, resulting in a bloated interface and high maintenance burden."
