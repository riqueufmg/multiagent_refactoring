    "justification": "The interface contains 12 inner classes and 2 nested interfaces (Resolution, NoOp, MultiReleaseAware, Simple, ForClassLoader, ForModule, ForJarFile, ForModuleFile, ForFolder, ForUrl, ForInstrumentation, PackageDiscriminating, Filtering, Compound) with extensive implementations totaling over 1600 lines. It handles multiple distinct responsibilities including locating class files from class loaders, modules, JAR files, JMOD files, folders, URLs, instrumentation, and compound sources. The interface has become a 'god interface' with excessive size and complexity, concentrating responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
