    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 7000 lines) and complexity, containing multiple nested classes (WithoutSpecification, Target, Substitution, Replacement, etc.) that could be separated into distinct abstractions. It handles diverse responsibilities including field substitution, method substitution, constructor substitution, invokedynamic substitution, type pool resolution, and delegation chains, resulting in a bloated interface with over 100 methods. The class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by combining visitor pattern implementation, substitution logic, annotation processing, and byte code manipulation."
