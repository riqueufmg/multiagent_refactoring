    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a small, focused abstract base class that properly encapsulates the responsibility of providing unsynchronized Reader behavior. It has minimal fields (closed flag, skip buffer), implements only essential methods (close, skip, isClosed, setClosed, checkOpen), and delegates to subclasses for core read operations. The class size is small, complexity is low, and interface is not bloated."
