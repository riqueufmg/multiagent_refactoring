    "justification": "The Main class has a single, clear responsibility: orchestrating file processing with a simple callback. It contains only main method, a process method, and a small nested Callback class. The class is small (under 50 lines), has low complexity, and doesn't exhibit bloated interface or multiple responsibilities that need decomposition."
