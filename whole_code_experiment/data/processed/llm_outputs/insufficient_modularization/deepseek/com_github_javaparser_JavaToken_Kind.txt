    "justification": "The class contains two large inner enums (Category and Kind) with 8 and 153 constants respectively, plus extensive enum methods. The Kind enum includes a 152-case switch statement for valueOf and other methods. The outer class also manages token list manipulation (insert, delete, replace), range/text handling, and token category logic, concentrating multiple responsibilities in one class."
