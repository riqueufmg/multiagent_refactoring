    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 7000 lines), high complexity with multiple deeply nested inner classes (WithoutSpecification, Substitution, Replacement, etc.), and a bloated interface with numerous public methods for configuration. It concentrates responsibilities for member substitution, field access substitution, method invocation substitution, dynamic invocation substitution, and complex substitution chains with delegation and offset mapping logic, all of which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
