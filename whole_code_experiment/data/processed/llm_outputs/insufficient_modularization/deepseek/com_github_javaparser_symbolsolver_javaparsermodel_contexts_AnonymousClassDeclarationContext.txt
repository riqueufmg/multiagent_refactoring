    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility (symbol resolution context for anonymous classes). It maintains low complexity with three focused methods (solveMethod, solveType, solveSymbol) that delegate appropriately. The class size is moderate and it leverages inheritance from AbstractJavaParserContext without bloating its interface."
