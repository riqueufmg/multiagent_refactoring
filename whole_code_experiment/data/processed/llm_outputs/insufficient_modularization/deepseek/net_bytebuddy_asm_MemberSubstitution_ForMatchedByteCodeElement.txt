    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 7000 lines), high complexity with multiple deeply nested inner classes (WithoutSpecification, Substitution, Replacement, etc.), and a bloated interface with numerous public methods. It concentrates responsibilities for member substitution, field access substitution, method invocation substitution, dynamic invocation substitution, type pool resolution, and delegation chain handling into a single class. The class contains multiple independent abstractions (Substitution, Replacement, Target, TypePoolResolver, OffsetMapping, Dispatcher) that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive classes."
