    "justification": "The Compound class is a simple composite pattern implementation with a single responsibility: managing and delegating to a collection of LoadedTypeInitializer instances. It has minimal complexity, a focused interface (two constructors and two interface method implementations), and appropriately delegates to contained initializers without absorbing unrelated responsibilities."
