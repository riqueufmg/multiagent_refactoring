    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 1,396 lines of code, containing multiple nested interfaces and enums (AttachmentProvider, ProcessProvider, AgentProvider, AttachmentTypeEvaluator) that represent distinct responsibilities. It handles agent attachment, instrumentation lookup, file manipulation, external process execution, and multiple platform-specific implementations within a single class, resulting in low cohesion and high cognitive load."
