    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of serializing AST nodes to JSON. It exhibits good modularization through focused public methods, private helper methods, and protected extension points. The internal enums are cohesive and related to the serialization format. The class size and complexity are appropriate for its purpose."
