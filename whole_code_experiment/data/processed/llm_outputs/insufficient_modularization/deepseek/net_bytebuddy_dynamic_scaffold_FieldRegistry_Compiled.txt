    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class exhibits high cohesion and appropriate decomposition: FieldRegistry is an interface with two focused implementations (NoOp enum and Default class). Default class is well-structured with separate inner classes (Entry and Compiled) handling distinct responsibilities. Each component has a single, clear purpose: Entry manages field matching and transformation configuration, Compiled handles runtime field resolution. The interface is minimal with only two methods. No excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface is present."
