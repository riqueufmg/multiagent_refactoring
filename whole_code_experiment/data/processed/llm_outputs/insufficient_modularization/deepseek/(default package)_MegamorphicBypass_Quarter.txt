    "justification": "The class combines multiple responsibilities: it defines three distinct Coin implementations (Nickel, Dime, Quarter), manages a static moneyBox state, contains complex constructor logic with performance optimization patterns, and includes a main method. These unrelated concerns should be separated into dedicated classes for each coin type, a money box manager, and a separate performance test harness."
