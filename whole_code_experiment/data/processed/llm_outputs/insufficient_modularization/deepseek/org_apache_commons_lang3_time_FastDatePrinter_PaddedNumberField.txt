    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "FastDatePrinter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class demonstrates high modularization through extensive use of inner classes (CharacterLiteral, PaddedNumberField, TextField, TimeZoneNameRule, etc.) that decompose formatting responsibilities into cohesive units. Each inner class has a single, well-defined purpose, and the main class orchestrates them through the Rule interface. The class size is justified by implementing a comprehensive date formatting framework with multiple formatting options, not by lack of decomposition."
