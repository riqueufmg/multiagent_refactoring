    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The interface and its nested classes/implementations represent a large abstraction (method description) that combines multiple responsibilities: method metadata representation, type variable handling, modifier management, bootstrap method validation, default value validation, bridge method compatibility checking, and multiple implementations (loaded method, loaded constructor, latent, type-substituting). The class contains 1575 lines of code with numerous nested interfaces and classes, indicating excessive size and complexity that could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
