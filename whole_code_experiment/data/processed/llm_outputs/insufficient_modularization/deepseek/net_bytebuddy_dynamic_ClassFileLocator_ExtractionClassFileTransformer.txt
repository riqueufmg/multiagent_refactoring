    "justification": "The interface contains 13 inner classes and 2 inner interfaces, totaling over 1600 lines of code. It exhibits excessive size and complexity by bundling multiple distinct responsibilities: various class file location strategies (ForClassLoader, ForJarFile, ForModule, ForFolder, ForInstrumentation, etc.), resolution types, filtering, packaging, and compound operations. The interface has a bloated interface with numerous factory methods and static utilities, concentrating responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
