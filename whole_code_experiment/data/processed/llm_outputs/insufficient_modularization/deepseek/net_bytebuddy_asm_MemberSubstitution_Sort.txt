    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is excessively large (over 7000 lines) and complex, containing multiple nested classes (WithoutSpecification, TypePoolResolver, Target, Substitution, Replacement, SubstitutingMethodVisitor) and numerous inner interfaces and enums. It handles multiple responsibilities including member matching, substitution logic, type resolution, bytecode manipulation, and delegation chains, all within a single class. The class exhibits a bloated interface with many public methods and nested types that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
