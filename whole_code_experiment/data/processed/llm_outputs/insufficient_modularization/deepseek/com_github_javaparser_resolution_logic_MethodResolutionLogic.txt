    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 800 lines) and complexity with multiple responsibilities including method applicability checking, type parameter substitution, variadic parameter handling, lambda type checking, and method selection logic. It contains numerous static helper methods (groupVariadicParamValues, findCommonType, isConflictingLambdaType, groupTrailingArgumentsIntoArray, isAssignableMatchTypeParameters, replaceTypeParam, substituteTypeVariables, inferTypes, etc.) that could be separated into cohesive abstractions. The class has a bloated interface with 15+ public static methods and lacks clear separation of concerns between type resolution, method matching, and generic type handling."
