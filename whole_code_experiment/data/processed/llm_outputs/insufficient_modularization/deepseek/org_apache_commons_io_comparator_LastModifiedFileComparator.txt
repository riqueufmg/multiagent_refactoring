    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small, focused, and has a single responsibility: comparing files by last modified timestamp. It extends AbstractFileComparator for common comparator functionality, implements only one compare method, and delegates timestamp retrieval to FileUtils. No excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface is present."
