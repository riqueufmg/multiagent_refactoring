    "justification": "The class demonstrates adequate decomposition through its abstract design with two concrete implementations (CsStrings and CiStrings) that separate case-sensitive and case-insensitive behaviors. It has a focused responsibility for string operations with configurable case handling, uses private static inner classes for specialized implementations, and maintains a clean interface with cohesive methods related to string comparison and manipulation."
