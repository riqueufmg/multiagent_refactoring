    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.PropertyConfigurable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FieldAccessor (including its nested classes and interfaces) exhibits excessive size and complexity with over 1000 lines of code, multiple nested classes (FieldLocation.Absolute, FieldLocation.Relative, FieldNameExtractor.ForBeanProperty, FieldNameExtractor.ForFixedValue, ForImplicitProperty, ForSetter with 5 specialized subclasses), and multiple interfaces (PropertyConfigurable, AssignerConfigurable, OwnerTypeLocatable) that create a bloated interface. It handles numerous responsibilities including field location strategies, field name extraction, getter/setter bytecode generation, constant value handling, reference value storage, and chained instrumentation, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
