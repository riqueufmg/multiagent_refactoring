    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The ClassFileLocator interface contains 12 inner classes and 2 inner interfaces, totaling over 2000 lines of code. It combines multiple distinct responsibilities including locating class files from class loaders, jar files, module files, folders, URLs, instrumentation, and implementing various decorator patterns (filtering, package discrimination, composition). This results in excessive size, complexity, and a bloated interface that concentrates responsibilities which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
