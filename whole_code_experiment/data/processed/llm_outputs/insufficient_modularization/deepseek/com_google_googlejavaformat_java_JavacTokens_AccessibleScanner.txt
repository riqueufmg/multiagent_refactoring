    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JavacTokens demonstrates adequate modularization by separating concerns into distinct nested classes (RawTok, CommentSavingTokenizer, CommentWithTextAndPosition, AccessibleScanner), each with a single, well-defined responsibility. The main class provides a focused public API (getTokens) while delegating specialized tasks to helper classes, resulting in manageable size and cohesive abstractions."
