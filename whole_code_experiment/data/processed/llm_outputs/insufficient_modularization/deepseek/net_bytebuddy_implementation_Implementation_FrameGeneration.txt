    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a large interface (over 1700 lines) that defines multiple nested interfaces, enums, and classes (SpecialMethodInvocation, Target, Context, Compound, Simple) with complex responsibilities. It exhibits excessive size and complexity, concentrating responsibilities for method implementation, byte code generation, frame generation, auxiliary type registration, method accessor creation, and field caching into a single abstraction. The interface has a bloated structure with deeply nested hierarchies and multiple concerns that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
