    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Main class combines multiple responsibilities: command-line argument parsing (processArgs), file I/O operations, parallel execution management, formatting orchestration, and result handling. It directly manages thread pools, file reading/writing, and result aggregation, resulting in a large class (over 200 lines) with high complexity. The class handles both stdin and file-based formatting with duplicated logic, and mixes CLI interface concerns with core formatting workflow coordination."
