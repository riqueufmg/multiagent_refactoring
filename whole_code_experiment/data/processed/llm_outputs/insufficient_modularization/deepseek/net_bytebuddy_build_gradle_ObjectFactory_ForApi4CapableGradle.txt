    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small (136 lines), focused on a single responsibility (creating instances via Gradle's ObjectFactory API with version fallback), and uses appropriate decomposition with a Dispatcher interface and two implementations. The static initialization and public method are minimal, and the nested types are cohesive and logically separated."
