    "justification": "The class is well-decomposed into cohesive abstractions: the main enum handles primitive type mapping, the nested ExplicitlyTypedUnboxingResponsible enum handles explicit unboxing, the ImplicitlyTypedUnboxingResponsible class handles implicit unboxing, and the UnboxingResponsible interface defines the contract. Each component has a single responsibility, and the class size and complexity are appropriate for its purpose."
