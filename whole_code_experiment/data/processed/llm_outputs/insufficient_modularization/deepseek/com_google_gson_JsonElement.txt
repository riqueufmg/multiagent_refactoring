    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is an abstract base class with a clear single responsibility: defining the common interface for JSON element types. It provides type checking methods and conversion methods, all of which are appropriate for its abstraction level. The class delegates implementation details to its subclasses (JsonObject, JsonArray, JsonPrimitive, JsonNull) and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
