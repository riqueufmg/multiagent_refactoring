    "class": "ModuleOpensDirective",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused, with only two fields (name, moduleNames) and corresponding getters/setters. It implements a single, clear abstraction (module opens directive) without excessive responsibilities. The methods are primarily generated boilerplate (accept, clone, replace, type-casting helpers) and do not indicate bloated interface or lack of decomposition."
