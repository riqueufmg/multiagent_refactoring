    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FastDatePrinter contains 17 inner classes and interfaces (Rule, NumberRule, CharacterLiteral, StringLiteral, TextField, PaddedNumberField, UnpaddedNumberField, TwoDigitNumberField, TwoDigitMonthField, TwoDigitYearField, UnpaddedMonthField, TwelveHourField, TwentyFourHourField, DayInWeekField, WeekYear, TimeZoneNameRule, TimeZoneNumberRule, Iso8601_Rule, TimeZoneDisplayKey) and numerous methods for formatting, parsing, and rule selection. This represents a large, complex abstraction that handles multiple responsibilities including pattern parsing, rule creation, formatting logic for various date/time components, time zone handling, and caching. The class has excessive size and complexity, concentrating responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions such as separate formatters, parsers, rule factories, or strategy objects."
