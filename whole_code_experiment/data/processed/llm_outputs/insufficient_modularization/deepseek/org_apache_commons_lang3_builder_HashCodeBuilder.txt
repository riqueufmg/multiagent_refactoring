    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "HashCodeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class combines multiple responsibilities: (1) building hash codes through explicit field appending (numerous overloaded append methods for primitive and object types), (2) providing reflection-based hash code generation (multiple reflectionHashCode methods with different parameters), (3) managing thread-local registry for cycle detection, and (4) implementing Builder<Integer> interface. This results in excessive size (over 500 lines), high complexity, and a bloated interface with many public methods. The reflection logic and registry management could be separated into distinct helper classes."
