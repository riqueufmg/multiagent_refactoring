    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of representing and manipulating a 2D bit matrix. It maintains a cohesive set of operations focused on bit manipulation, region operations, rotations, and conversions. The size is reasonable for its domain, and there is no clear separation of concerns that would benefit from decomposition into smaller classes."
