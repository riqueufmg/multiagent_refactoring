    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class demonstrates adequate modularization through decomposition into inner classes (CheckIntervalData, AbstractStateStrategy, StateStrategyClosed, StateStrategyOpen) that encapsulate specific responsibilities. The main class maintains a focused interface for circuit breaker operations while delegating state-specific logic to strategy classes. The class size and complexity are appropriate for its abstraction level."
