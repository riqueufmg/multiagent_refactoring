    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is adequately decomposed with a clear single responsibility of cleaning direct ByteBuffers. It uses inner classes (Java8Cleaner, Java9Cleaner) to encapsulate version-specific implementations, has a small public interface (clean(), isSupported()), and maintains low complexity with minimal methods and fields."
