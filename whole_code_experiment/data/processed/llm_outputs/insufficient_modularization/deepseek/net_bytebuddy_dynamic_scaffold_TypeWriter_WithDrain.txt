    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithDrain",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a massive inner class (over 4000 lines) that contains multiple nested interfaces, enums, and classes (FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool, Default, ForInlining, ForCreation, etc.), each with their own complex hierarchies and implementations. It handles responsibilities for type writing, field/method/record component processing, validation, initialization, redefinition, rebasing, decoration, and dumping, all within a single abstraction. The class exhibits excessive size, complexity, and a bloated interface, concentrating many responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
