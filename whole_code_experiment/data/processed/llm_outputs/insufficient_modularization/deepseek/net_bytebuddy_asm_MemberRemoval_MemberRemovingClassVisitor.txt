    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberRemoval",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class exhibits high cohesion with a single responsibility of member removal configuration and delegation. It properly delegates ASM visitor logic to a private inner class (MemberRemovingClassVisitor), maintaining clear separation of concerns. The class size is moderate (approx. 200 lines) with focused methods for configuring field/method/constructor removal. The interface is not bloated, offering only essential builder-style methods for configuration."
