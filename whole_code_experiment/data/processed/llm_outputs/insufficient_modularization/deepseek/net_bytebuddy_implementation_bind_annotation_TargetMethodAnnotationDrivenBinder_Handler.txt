    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class contains multiple nested classes and interfaces (Record, ParameterBinder, DelegationProcessor) that handle distinct responsibilities (method binding compilation, parameter binding strategies, delegation processing). These abstractions are embedded within the main class, resulting in excessive size and complexity. The ParameterBinder interface alone contains two abstract inner classes (ForFixedValue, ForFieldBinding) with their own hierarchies, and the DelegationProcessor contains Handler interface with two implementations. This concentration of responsibilities suggests inadequate decomposition into separate, cohesive classes."
