    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 7300 lines) and complexity, containing multiple nested classes (WithoutSpecification, Target, Substitution, Replacement, etc.) that represent distinct responsibilities. It handles field substitution, method substitution, constructor substitution, invokedynamic substitution, substitution chains with delegation steps, offset mappings, and ASM visitor logic within a single class. The class has a bloated interface with numerous factory methods and configuration options, concentrating responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions such as dedicated classes for different substitution types, chain step implementations, and offset mapping resolvers."
