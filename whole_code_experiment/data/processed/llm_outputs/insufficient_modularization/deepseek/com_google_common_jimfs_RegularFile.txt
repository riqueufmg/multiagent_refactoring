    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "RegularFile",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity by combining multiple responsibilities: block management (expandIfNecessary, copyBlocksTo, transferBlocksTo, truncateBlocks, addBlock, getBlock), file I/O operations (write, read, transferFrom, transferTo), file state management (opened, closed, deleted, deleteContents, truncate), and low-level byte manipulation utilities (zero, put, get). It has a bloated interface with 30+ public and package-private methods, handling both high-level file operations and low-level block/byte operations without adequate decomposition into cohesive abstractions."
