    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size (over 2500 lines) and complexity, containing multiple nested interfaces and classes (MethodLocator, ArgumentLoader, TargetHandler, MethodInvoker, TerminationHandler) within a single file. It handles numerous responsibilities including method location, argument loading, target resolution, method invocation, and termination handling, which could be separated into distinct, cohesive abstractions. The class has a bloated interface with over 50 public methods and represents a 'god class' that centralizes too many functionalities related to method call implementation."
