    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "AbstractByteBuddyTask",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 300+ lines, multiple responsibilities including task configuration management, plugin discovery, class loading, file deletion utilities, and transformation logging. It contains three nested classes (TransformationLogger, ByteBuddySkippingUrlClassLoader) and a large static apply method with 20+ parameters, indicating poor decomposition of concerns."
