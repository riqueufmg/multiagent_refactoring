    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is an interface that defines a clear abstraction for writing class files using ASM. It declares only three methods and contains nested interfaces (FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool) that decompose responsibilities. The main interface is not excessively large or complex, and its nested interfaces further modularize field, method, and record component handling. The abstraction is appropriately decomposed with cohesive nested types."
