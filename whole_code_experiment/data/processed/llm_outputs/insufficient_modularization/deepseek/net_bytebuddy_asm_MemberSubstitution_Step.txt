    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is excessively large (over 7000 lines) and complex, containing multiple nested classes (WithoutSpecification, Target, Substitution, Replacement, etc.) that represent distinct responsibilities. It handles field substitution, method substitution, constructor substitution, invokedynamic substitution, type pool resolution, delegation chains, and offset mappings within a single class. The interface is bloated with numerous factory methods and configuration options. The class exhibits low cohesion by combining multiple independent abstractions that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
