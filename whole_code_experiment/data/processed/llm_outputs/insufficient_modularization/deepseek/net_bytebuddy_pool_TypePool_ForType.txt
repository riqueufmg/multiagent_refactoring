    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is an interface (TypePool) with multiple nested classes and interfaces that decompose its responsibilities into cohesive abstractions such as Resolution, CacheProvider, AbstractBase, Default, LazyFacade, ClassLoading, and Explicit. Each nested component handles specific concerns like caching, lazy resolution, class loading, and explicit type descriptions, demonstrating adequate decomposition rather than excessive size or complexity in a single class."
