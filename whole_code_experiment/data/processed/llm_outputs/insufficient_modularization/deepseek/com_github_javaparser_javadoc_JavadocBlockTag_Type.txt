    "justification": "The class is small and focused, with a single responsibility of representing a Javadoc block tag. The enum Type is appropriately nested as it's tightly coupled to the tag's functionality. The class has a clear interface, minimal complexity, and no evidence of bloated size or multiple separable responsibilities."
