    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The VirtualMachine interface and its nested classes (ForHotSpot, ForOpenJ9) exhibit excessive size and complexity, concentrating multiple responsibilities including platform-specific implementations (Windows, POSIX, Solaris, OpenJ9), connection management, protocol handling, and native library interactions. The ForHotSpot class alone contains 5 nested interfaces and 6 nested classes, with deep inheritance hierarchies and platform-specific code paths. The class spans over 2000 lines, violating single responsibility principle and demonstrating inadequate decomposition into cohesive abstractions."
