    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Node",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Node class exhibits excessive size and complexity with over 1000 lines of code, combining multiple responsibilities including AST node representation, parent-child relationship management, visitor pattern implementation, observer pattern implementation, data storage, tree traversal algorithms, comment handling, range/position management, symbol resolution integration, and printing/formatting logic. It contains five inner iterator classes (BreadthFirstIterator, DirectChildrenIterator, ParentsVisitor, PreOrderIterator, PostOrderIterator) that could be separate classes, and handles diverse concerns from low-level data storage to high-level tree operations, resulting in a bloated interface with numerous public methods."
