    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is appropriately modularized for its purpose as a visitor adapter. It provides default implementations for all visitor methods by traversing child nodes, following a consistent pattern. The class has a single responsibility (default traversal behavior), low complexity per method, and a cohesive interface defined by the VoidVisitor contract. The size is justified by the need to implement the complete AST node hierarchy interface."
