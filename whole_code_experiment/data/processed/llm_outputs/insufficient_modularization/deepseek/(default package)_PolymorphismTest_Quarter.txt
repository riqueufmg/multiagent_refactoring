    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class combines multiple responsibilities: it defines a Coin interface, implements three distinct coin types (Nickel, Dime, Quarter), contains a static moneyBox variable, includes constructor logic for performance testing with polymorphic dispatch, and has a main method. These unrelated concerns (interface definition, multiple implementations, test harness, and application entry point) should be separated into cohesive modules."
