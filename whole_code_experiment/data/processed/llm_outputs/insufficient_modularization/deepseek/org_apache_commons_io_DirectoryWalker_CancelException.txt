    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "DirectoryWalker",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and complexity with 15 methods and 3 constructors, concentrating multiple responsibilities including file filtering, directory traversal logic, cancellation handling, and providing numerous lifecycle hooks. It has a bloated interface with many protected methods (handleDirectory, handleFile, handleStart, handleEnd, handleIsCancelled, etc.) that could be separated into more cohesive abstractions such as separate visitor interfaces, filter strategies, or traversal policies."
