    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility (creating TypeAdapters for Collections) and is appropriately decomposed with a small, focused inner Adapter class. The main class has only one factory method, and the inner Adapter handles only serialization/deserialization of collections. The class is small (under 100 lines), has low complexity, and a minimal interface."
