    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.compare.ComparableUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class demonstrates adequate modularization through a clear single responsibility (translating compareTo results to booleans), cohesive helper methods, a focused builder class (ComparableCheckBuilder) that encapsulates comparison logic, and static factory methods that provide functional predicates. The class size is moderate with well-organized, related functionality."
