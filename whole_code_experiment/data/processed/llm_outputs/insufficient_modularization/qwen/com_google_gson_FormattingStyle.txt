    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FormattingStyle is well-designed with a single responsibility of controlling serialization output formatting. It has a clear and cohesive interface with only three core configuration attributes (newline, indent, spaceAfterSeparators) and corresponding methods. The class is relatively small (approximately 1526 characters), follows immutable design patterns, and maintains good separation of concerns. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
