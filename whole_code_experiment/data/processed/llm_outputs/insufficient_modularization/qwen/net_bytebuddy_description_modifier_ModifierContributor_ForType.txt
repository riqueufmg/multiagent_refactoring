    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ModifierContributor is appropriately modularized. It defines a clear abstraction for modifier contributors and separates concerns through nested interfaces (ForType, ForModule, ForField, etc.) that represent distinct categories of modifiers. The Resolver class is generic and handles resolution for all modifier types without duplicating logic. The class has a single responsibility of representing modifier contributors and resolving them, with well-defined interfaces and minimal complexity. The size and structure support maintainability and understandability rather than hindering it."
