    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "MutableFloat",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MutableFloat is a well-defined, cohesive class that encapsulates a single responsibility: providing a mutable wrapper for a float value. It offers a reasonable set of methods for manipulating and accessing the mutable float value, including constructors, arithmetic operations, comparison, and conversion methods. The class is not excessively large or complex, and its interface is appropriately focused on the mutable float abstraction. The presence of multiple methods is justified by the class's purpose to support various operations on a mutable float, and the methods are logically grouped around this central responsibility. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
