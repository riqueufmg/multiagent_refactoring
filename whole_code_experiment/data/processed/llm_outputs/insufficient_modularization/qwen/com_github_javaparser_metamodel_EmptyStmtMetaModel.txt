    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class EmptyStmtMetaModel is a small, focused class with a single constructor and no additional methods or fields. It represents a specific and well-defined abstraction for metadata modeling of EmptyStmt nodes. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. It adheres to the single responsibility principle and is appropriately decomposed, thus does not present the smell of Insufficient Modularization."
