        "The class MethodDelegationBinder is an interface that contains multiple nested interfaces, enums, and classes, resulting in excessive size and complexity.",
        "It encompasses various responsibilities such as method binding, parameter binding, ambiguity resolution, and termination handling, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.",
        "The class has a bloated interface with numerous nested components like MethodInvoker, ParameterBinding, MethodBinding, BindingResolver, AmbiguityResolver, and TerminationHandler, each with their own nested types and implementations.",
        "The extensive nesting and the large number of methods and nested classes make the class difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve."
