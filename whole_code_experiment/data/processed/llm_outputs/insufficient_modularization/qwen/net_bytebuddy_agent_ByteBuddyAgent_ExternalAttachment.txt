        "The class has excessive size with numerous methods and nested classes, making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "It concentrates multiple responsibilities including agent installation, attachment handling, process management, and instrumentation lookup.",
        "The class contains several nested interfaces and enums (AttachmentProvider, ProcessProvider, AgentProvider, AttachmentTypeEvaluator) that could be separated into their own cohesive abstractions.",
        "Complexity is increased by the presence of multiple attachment strategies, platform-specific logic, and fallback mechanisms all within a single class.",
        "The bloated interface makes it hard to evolve specific parts without affecting the entire class structure."
