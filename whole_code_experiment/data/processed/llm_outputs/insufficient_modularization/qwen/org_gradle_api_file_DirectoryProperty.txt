    "justification": "The DirectoryProperty interface is well-focused with only 5 methods that are all closely related to directory property management. The interface maintains high cohesion by concentrating solely on directory-related operations (getAsFile, getAsFileTree, dir, set) and does not exhibit excessive size or complexity. The abstraction is appropriately decomposed and does not concentrate unrelated responsibilities that could be separated into smaller abstractions."
