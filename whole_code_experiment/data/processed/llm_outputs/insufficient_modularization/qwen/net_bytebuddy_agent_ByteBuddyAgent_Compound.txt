    "detection": true,
    "justification": [
        "The class 'ByteBuddyAgent' is excessively large, containing over 13,962 lines of code, which indicates high complexity and lack of decomposition.",
        "It encompasses multiple responsibilities including agent installation, attachment handling, process identification, and instrumentation retrieval, which should be separated into distinct classes or modules.",
        "The class contains several nested interfaces and enums (e.g., AttachmentProvider, ProcessProvider, AgentProvider, AttachmentTypeEvaluator) that further contribute to its bloated interface and complexity.",
        "The presence of numerous private static methods and overloaded public methods for similar operations (e.g., multiple 'attach' and 'install' variants) suggests that the class is doing too much and lacks proper modularization.",
        "The class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by managing various aspects of agent management, making it difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve."
