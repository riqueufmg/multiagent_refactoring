    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ZingLine has a single responsibility of representing a parsed Zing JIT compilation log line and converting it to various tag/task representations. It contains 21 fields that are all related to JIT compilation metadata, and all methods are cohesive and directly related to accessing or transforming this data. The class does not exceed typical size thresholds for insufficient modularization, contains no duplicated functionality, and maintains clear separation of concerns with focused getter/setter methods, conversion methods (toTagQueued, toTagNMethod, toTagTask), and helper methods. The design follows standard data model patterns with encapsulation and transformation responsibilities appropriately contained within the class."
