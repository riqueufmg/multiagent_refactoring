        "The TypeDescription interface is extremely large, containing over 66,000 lines of code when including all nested classes and interfaces",
        "It encompasses numerous responsibilities including type representation, generic type handling, annotation processing, module system support, and reflection utilities",
        "The class contains multiple nested interfaces (Generic, AnnotationReader) and numerous nested classes that handle different aspects of type description",
        "Functionality spans across basic type operations, generic type manipulation, annotation handling, module descriptions, and lazy loading mechanisms",
        "The interface mixes core type description responsibilities with complex generic type visitor patterns, annotation readers, and type projection mechanisms",
        "Contains deeply nested class hierarchies with multiple levels of abstraction (Generic.Visitor implementations, LazyProjection subclasses, Builder patterns)",
        "The single interface attempts to represent all possible type scenarios (arrays, primitives, parameterized types, wildcards, type variables) rather than delegating to specialized components"
