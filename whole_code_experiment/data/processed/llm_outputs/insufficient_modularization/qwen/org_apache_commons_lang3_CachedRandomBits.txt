    "class": "CachedRandomBits",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CachedRandomBits is well-focused on a single responsibility: generating random integers of specific bit length using a cached byte array for efficiency. It has a clear and cohesive design with only two public methods (constructor and nextBits) and a reasonable number of private fields and constants that directly support its core functionality. The class is relatively small in terms of lines of code and complexity, and there is no evidence of bloated interfaces or excessive complexity that would indicate insufficient decomposition. The implementation is straightforward and maintains a single, well-defined abstraction."
