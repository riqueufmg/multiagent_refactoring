    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ParameterList is an interface that defines a clear abstraction for handling lists of parameters. It is well-decomposed into several inner classes and interfaces, each with distinct responsibilities: AbstractBase provides common functionality, ForLoadedExecutable handles parameters for loaded executables (with further specializations like OfConstructor and OfMethod), Explicit handles explicit parameter descriptions, ForTokens deals with detached tokens, TypeSubstituting manages type substitution, and Empty represents an empty list. Each inner class is focused on a specific aspect of parameter handling, demonstrating good modularization. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface, and responsibilities are appropriately separated into smaller, cohesive abstractions."
