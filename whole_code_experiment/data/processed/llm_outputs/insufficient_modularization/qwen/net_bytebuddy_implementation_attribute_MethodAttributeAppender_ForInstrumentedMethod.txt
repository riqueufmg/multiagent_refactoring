    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MethodAttributeAppender is an interface that defines a single cohesive responsibility: applying method attributes via a MethodVisitor. While it contains several nested classes and enums, these are well-organized into distinct, single-responsibility components (NoOp, Factory, ForInstrumentedMethod, Explicit, ForReceiverType, Compound). Each nested type handles a specific aspect of method attribute appending without excessive complexity or size. The interface and its implementations maintain clear separation of concerns and do not exhibit bloated interfaces or concentrated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient decomposition."
