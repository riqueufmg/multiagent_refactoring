    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ClassInjector.UsingReflection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ClassInjector.UsingReflection has excessive size and complexity with 23483 characters, contains multiple nested classes (Dispatcher hierarchy with 10+ inner classes), and handles various responsibilities including reflection-based class loading, security checks, package definition strategies, and multiple injection mechanisms (Direct, UsingUnsafeInjection, UsingUnsafeOverride). The class combines too many abstraction layers and implementation details that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive components."
