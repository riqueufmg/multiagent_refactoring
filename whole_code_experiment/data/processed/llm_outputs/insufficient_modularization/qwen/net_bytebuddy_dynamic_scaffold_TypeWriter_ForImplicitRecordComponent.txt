    "justification": "The class TypeWriter.ForImplicitRecordComponent is a well-defined, cohesive unit responsible for representing implicit record components in the Byte Buddy library. It has a single responsibility of handling record component descriptions that are not explicitly defined in a record component pool. The class is small, focused, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. It contains only the necessary methods and fields to fulfill its specific role, making it adequately modularized."
