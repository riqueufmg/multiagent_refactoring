    "justification": [
        "The class TextElementIteratorsFactory contains multiple nested classes (CascadingIterator, EmptyIterator, SingleElementIterator, ComposedIterator) that implement different iterator behaviors, indicating a concentration of responsibilities.",
        "The class has multiple public static methods (reverseIterator, partialReverseIterator) that deal with different aspects of iterator creation and composition, adding to its complexity.",
        "The class serves as a factory for various iterator types while also containing complex logic for iterator composition and management, making it large and multifaceted.",
        "The presence of nested classes and multiple utility methods suggests that the abstraction has not been adequately decomposed into smaller, more cohesive units."
