    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "MethodAttributeAppender.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MethodAttributeAppender.Explicit is well-structured and maintains a clear separation of concerns. It encapsulates the logic for appending annotations to methods or method parameters, with distinct constructors for different targets (method or parameter), factory methods for creating appenders from method descriptions, and a clear apply method for executing the annotation appending logic. The class is of moderate size, with responsibilities focused solely on explicit annotation appending, and does not exhibit excessive complexity or a bloated interface. The nested Target interface and its implementations are appropriately contained and contribute to the class's modular design rather than detracting from it."
