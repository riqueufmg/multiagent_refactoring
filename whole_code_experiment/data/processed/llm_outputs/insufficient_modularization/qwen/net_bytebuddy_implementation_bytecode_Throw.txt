    "class": "Throw",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Throw' is a minimal enum implementation with only two methods (isValid and apply) and a single constant. It represents a single, well-defined responsibility of throwing exceptions in bytecode manipulation. The class is small, simple, and cohesive, with no excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
