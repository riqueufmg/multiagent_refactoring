    "justification": "The class CodaBarReader is well-focused on decoding Codabar barcodes and encapsulates related functionality without excessive complexity. While it contains several methods and responsibilities, they are all cohesive and directly related to the barcode decoding process. The class does not exhibit signs of being bloated or having responsibilities that could be separated into smaller abstractions. It maintains a clear purpose and reasonable size, with methods that support its core responsibility of decoding."
