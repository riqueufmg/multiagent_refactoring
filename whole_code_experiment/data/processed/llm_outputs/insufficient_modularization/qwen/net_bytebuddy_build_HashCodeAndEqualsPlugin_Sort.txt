    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin is well modularized. It has a single responsibility of generating hashCode and equals methods for annotated classes. The class is not excessively large or complex, and its interface is not bloated. It properly uses inner classes (WithNonNullableFields, Enhance, ValueHandling, Sorted, Identity, AnnotationOrderComparator, ValueMatcher) to encapsulate related functionality, demonstrating good decomposition. The class adheres to the single responsibility principle and maintains clear separation of concerns."
