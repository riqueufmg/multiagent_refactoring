    "justification": [
        "The class 'Ops' has an excessive number of methods (over 300), indicating it承担 multiple responsibilities.",
        "The class directly exposes a very large number of TensorFlow operations without sufficient abstraction or decomposition into smaller, more cohesive units.",
        "The class has 13 public fields (nn, summary, image, data, io, dtypes, linalg, random, strings, sparse, bitwise, math, audio, signal, train, quantization) which indicates it is managing too many sub-components.",
        "The class serves as a single entry point for almost all TensorFlow operations, violating the Single Responsibility Principle by acting as a god object.",
        "There is a lack of clear separation of concerns as the class handles creation of constants, variables, gradients, control flow operations, and many domain-specific operations all within one class."
