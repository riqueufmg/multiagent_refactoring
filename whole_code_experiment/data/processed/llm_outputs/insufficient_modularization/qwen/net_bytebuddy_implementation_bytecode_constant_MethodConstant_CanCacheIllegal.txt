    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "MethodConstant.CanCacheIllegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MethodConstant.CanCacheIllegal is a nested enum with minimal responsibilities. It only implements the CanCache interface and provides implementations for three simple methods: cached(), isValid(), and apply(). The class is small, focused, and cohesive, representing a single abstraction (an illegal/unrepresentable method constant). There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
