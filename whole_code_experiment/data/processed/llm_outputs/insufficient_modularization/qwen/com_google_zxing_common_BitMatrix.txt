    "detection": "false",
    "justification": "The BitMatrix class, while large in terms of lines of code, represents a single cohesive abstraction: a 2D matrix of bits. All methods are directly related to bit manipulation, matrix operations, and data representation. The class has a single responsibility of managing a 2D bit matrix with efficient internal storage. The methods are well-organized around this central abstraction, including constructors, bit manipulation (get/set/unset/flip), region operations, rotation, parsing, and utility methods. The internal representation using a 1D array of ints is consistently used throughout all operations. While the class has many methods, they all serve the same core purpose and are appropriately grouped together. The class does not mix unrelated responsibilities and maintains good cohesion around its central abstraction."
