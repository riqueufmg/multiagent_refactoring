    "class": "JimfsInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JimfsInputStream is well-focused on its responsibility as an InputStream implementation for reading from a file. It has a clear, single purpose and encapsulates the necessary state (file, position, finished status, fileSystemState) to fulfill that purpose. The methods are cohesive and directly related to stream operations (read, skip, available, close). The class is not excessively large or complex, and the interface is appropriately minimal for an InputStream. There is no evidence of responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
