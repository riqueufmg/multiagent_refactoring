    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of adapting java.sql.Time to/from JSON. It is small in size (less than 100 lines), has a clear purpose, and does not expose a bloated interface. While it handles synchronization due to DateFormat not being thread-safe, this does not indicate insufficient modularization but rather a necessary design choice to ensure thread safety. The class is cohesive and focused."
