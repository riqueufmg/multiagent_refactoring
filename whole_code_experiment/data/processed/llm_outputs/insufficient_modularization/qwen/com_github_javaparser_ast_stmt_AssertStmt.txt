    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class AssertStmt is a well-defined, cohesive representation of an assert statement in Java. It has a clear responsibility of modeling an assert statement with a check expression and an optional message. The class is small in size, contains only essential fields (check and message), and provides straightforward getter, setter, and visitor methods. There is no excessive complexity, bloated interface, or concentration of unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
