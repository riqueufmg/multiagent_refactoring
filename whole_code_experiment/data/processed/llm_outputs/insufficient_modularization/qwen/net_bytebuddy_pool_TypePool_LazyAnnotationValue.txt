    "justification": "The class TypePool.LazyAnnotationValue is a well-focused, cohesive abstraction representing a lazy annotation value. It encapsulates the behavior of lazy resolution of annotation values, with subclasses handling specific cases (ForMismatchedType, ForTypeValue, ForAnnotationValue, ForEnumerationValue, ForArray). The class has a single responsibility: to act as a lazy proxy for annotation values. Its size (approximately 67KB) is due to necessary complexity in handling various annotation value types and lazy loading semantics, not due to inadequate decomposition. The class properly delegates to actual annotation value resolution only when needed, maintaining clear boundaries of responsibility."
