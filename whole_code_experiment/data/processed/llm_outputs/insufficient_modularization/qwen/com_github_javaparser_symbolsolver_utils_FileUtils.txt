    "justification": "The class FileUtils is appropriately modularized. It contains only two static utility methods related to file operations, which are cohesive and focused on a single responsibility. The class is small, simple, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
