    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Instantiation is a simple data class with only two fields and their corresponding getters. It includes standard implementations of equals, hashCode, and toString methods. The class has a single responsibility of representing an instantiation mapping between an inference variable and a resolved type, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
