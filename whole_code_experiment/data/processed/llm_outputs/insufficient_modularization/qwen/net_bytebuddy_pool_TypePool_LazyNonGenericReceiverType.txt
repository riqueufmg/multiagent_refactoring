    "justification": "The class TypePool.LazyNonGenericReceiverType is a nested class within the large TypePool interface, but it is relatively small and focused. It represents a specific abstraction for non-generic receiver types and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. The class has a clear, single responsibility - to describe non-generic receiver types in the context of method declarations. It contains only a few fields and methods that are directly related to this responsibility, and its interface is not bloated. While it is part of a larger complex structure (the TypePool interface), the class itself is adequately decomposed and does not represent an abstraction that has not been adequately decomposed."
