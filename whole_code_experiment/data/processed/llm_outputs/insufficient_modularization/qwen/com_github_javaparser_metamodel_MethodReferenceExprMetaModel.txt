    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MethodReferenceExprMetaModel is a generated meta-model class with a very limited and focused responsibility. It contains only a constructor that initializes meta-model information and four public fields representing property meta-models. The class is small, simple, and cohesive, adhering to a single abstraction related to method reference expression meta-data. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
