    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "SerializedConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class SerializedConstant is focused on a single responsibility: handling the serialization and deserialization of constant values for bytecode manipulation. It has a clear and cohesive abstraction with only essential methods (constructor, factory method 'of', and 'apply'). The class is relatively small in size and does not exhibit excessive complexity or a bloated interface. While it handles serialization logic, this is appropriately encapsulated within the class's core purpose and does not warrant decomposition into multiple classes."
