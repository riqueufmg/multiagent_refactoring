    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Main has a single responsibility of processing directories and parsing Java files using a callback. It contains only essential methods: main, process, and a nested Callback class that implements a specific interface. The size and complexity are minimal, and responsibilities are adequately separated. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
