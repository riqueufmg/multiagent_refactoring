    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a clear and focused responsibility of wrapping a Callable for background execution. It has only 2 public methods (constructors) and 2 private methods, with a single private field. The class is small in size (less than 100 lines), has low complexity, and a clean interface. It properly delegates to the Callable interface and doesn't contain multiple responsibilities or excessive functionality that would require decomposition."
