    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Invokedynamic is a well-defined, cohesive abstraction representing a stack manipulation for invokedynamic invocation. It has a single responsibility, encapsulating the necessary data (name, type, bootstrap, arguments) and behavior (apply method) for this specific bytecode operation. The class is relatively small, with only one public method (apply) and a straightforward constructor. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
