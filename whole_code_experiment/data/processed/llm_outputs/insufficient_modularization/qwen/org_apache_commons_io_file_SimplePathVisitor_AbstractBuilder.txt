    "justification": "The class SimplePathVisitor.AbstractBuilder is of reasonable size and encapsulates a single responsibility: building instances of SimplePathVisitor with a configurable visitFileFailedFunction. It has a clear and limited interface with only three methods (constructor, getter, and setter), which directly relate to its single responsibility. The class does not exhibit excessive complexity or a bloated interface, and its abstraction is adequately decomposed."
