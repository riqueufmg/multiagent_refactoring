    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Log is well modularized. It defines a clear abstraction for a logging framework with a single responsibility. The inner classes StandardOutStandardErrorAdapter and SilentAdapter are cohesive implementations of the Adapter interface, and the main Log class coordinates logging through the adapter pattern. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. Responsibilities are appropriately separated into small, focused methods and inner classes, making the class easy to understand and maintain."
