    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has excessive size with 20+ methods, multiple responsibilities including demo execution, JIT testing, and utility functions, and lacks clear separation of concerns. The class handles initialization, performs various benchmark tests, contains utility methods for arithmetic operations, manages collection operations, and includes string manipulation - all within a single class rather than being decomposed into smaller, cohesive modules."
