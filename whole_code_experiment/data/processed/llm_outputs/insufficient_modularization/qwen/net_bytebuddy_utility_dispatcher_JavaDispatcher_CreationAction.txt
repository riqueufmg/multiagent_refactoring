        "The class has excessive size with numerous nested classes and complex logic for handling proxy generation and method dispatching.",
        "It concentrates multiple responsibilities including proxy creation, method invocation handling, class loading, and module system adjustments.",
        "The class contains several nested classes (Dispatcher interface with multiple implementations, ProxiedInvocationHandler, DynamicClassLoader, etc.) that could be separated into their own cohesive abstractions.",
        "The run() method is overly complex, handling security checks, method resolution, dispatcher creation, and proxy instantiation in a single method.",
        "The class manages both reflection-based and bytecode-generated proxy mechanisms, mixing different abstraction levels within the same class.",
        "Multiple concerns are intertwined such as security management, class loading, method dispatching, and bytecode generation without clear separation of concerns."
