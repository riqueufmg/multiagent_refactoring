    "justification": "The class NoBinaryIntegerLiteralsValidator is small and focused, with only two overridden visitor methods and a single private validation method. It has a single responsibility of validating that binary integer literals are not present, and its interface is not bloated. The class is well-decomposed and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface."
