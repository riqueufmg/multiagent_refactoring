    "justification": "The class MECARDTelDisplayFormatter is a private static nested class with a single responsibility: formatting telephone numbers for display in MECARD format. It contains only a constant pattern and a single method implementation, making it highly cohesive and appropriately sized. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface, and its functionality is well-decomposed from the outer class responsibilities."
