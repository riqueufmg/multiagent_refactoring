        "The TypeDescription interface is extremely large, containing over 66,000 lines of code according to the context size, which indicates excessive size and complexity",
        "The class encompasses numerous nested interfaces and implementations (Generic, OfNonGenericType, OfGenericArray, OfWildcardType, OfParameterizedType, OfTypeVariable, etc.) that could be separated into distinct, cohesive modules",
        "The interface defines a bloated API with dozens of methods covering various aspects of type description (field access, method access, generic type handling, annotation processing, etc.) that violate the single responsibility principle",
        "Complex nested class hierarchies exist within the class (e.g., Visitor patterns, Builder patterns, LazyProjection hierarchies) that increase cognitive complexity and make the class difficult to understand and maintain",
        "The class attempts to handle multiple concerns simultaneously: type representation, generic type handling, annotation processing, type variable management, and bytecode-level type operations, indicating inadequate decomposition of responsibilities"
