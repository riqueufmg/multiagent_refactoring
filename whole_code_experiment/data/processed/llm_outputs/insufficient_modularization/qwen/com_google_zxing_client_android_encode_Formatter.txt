    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Formatter interface is properly modularized with a single, well-defined responsibility. It contains only one method (format) that performs a specific formatting task, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle. The interface is small, focused, and cohesive, representing a clear abstraction for formatting operations. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
