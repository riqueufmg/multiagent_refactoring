    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ForEachStatementContext is small and focused, implementing only the necessary logic to handle the context of a for-each statement. It has a clear responsibility, a limited number of methods, and does not exhibit excessive size or complexity. The class adheres to the single responsibility principle and is well-decomposed, thus does not present the Insufficient Modularization smell."
