    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class UserLookupService is well-designed with clear separation of concerns. It has a single responsibility of providing user and group principal lookup functionality. The class is not excessively large or complex, containing only 6 methods and proper encapsulation. It delegates specific responsibilities to inner classes JimfsUserPrincipal and JimfsGroupPrincipal through the NamedPrincipal abstraction. The interface is not bloated - it only exposes two public methods as required by the UserPrincipalLookupService specification. Inner classes are properly used to encapsulate related functionality while maintaining cohesion and minimizing complexity."
