    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class StringUtil is a utility class containing only static methods related to string manipulation and formatting. It has a single responsibility of providing various string utility functions. The class is well-cohesive with all methods serving the same general purpose of string processing. The size is reasonable (3167 characters) and complexity is low to moderate with mostly straightforward string operations. There's no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
