    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class EventCountCircuitBreaker is well-factored into multiple cohesive inner classes (AbstractStateStrategy, CheckIntervalData, StateStrategyClosed, StateStrategyOpen) that encapsulate specific responsibilities. The core logic is appropriately decomposed, with clear separation of concerns between state management, interval tracking, and strategy-based state transitions. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface; rather, it maintains a focused abstraction around event-count-based circuit breaking."
