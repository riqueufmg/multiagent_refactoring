    "detection": true,
    "justification": [
        "The class 'TypeProxy' is excessively large and complex, containing multiple nested classes (AbstractMethodErrorThrow, SilentConstruction, ForSuperMethodByConstructor, ForSuperMethodByReflectionFactory, ForDefaultMethod, MethodCall) and enums (InvocationFactory.Default) that could be separated into their own files or modules.",
        "The class has multiple responsibilities including proxy creation, method interception, stack manipulation, and handling different invocation strategies, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.",
        "The MethodCall inner class contains deeply nested classes (Appender, AccessorMethodInvocation) which further increases complexity and reduces maintainability.",
        "The class implements various proxy creation mechanisms (constructor-based, reflection-based, default method-based) that are not cohesive and could be modularized into separate classes or components.",
        "The presence of numerous static final fields, enums, and inner classes indicates a lack of proper decomposition and modularization."
