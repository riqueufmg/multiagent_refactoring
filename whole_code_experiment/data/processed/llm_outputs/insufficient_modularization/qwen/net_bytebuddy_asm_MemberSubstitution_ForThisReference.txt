        "The class 'MemberSubstitution' is excessively large, containing over 73,000 lines of code, which indicates a high level of complexity and responsibility.",
        "The class encompasses multiple nested classes and interfaces (e.g., 'WithoutSpecification', 'TypePoolResolver', 'Target', 'Substitution', 'Replacement') that handle various aspects of member substitution, field access, method invocation, and dynamic invocation, suggesting a lack of clear separation of concerns.",
        "The class implements numerous functionalities including method/field matching, substitution logic, bytecode manipulation, and delegation mechanisms, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.",
        "The presence of deeply nested generic types and complex conditional logic further contributes to the class's complexity, making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "The class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by managing too many responsibilities related to bytecode transformation and member substitution, rather than delegating them to specialized components."
