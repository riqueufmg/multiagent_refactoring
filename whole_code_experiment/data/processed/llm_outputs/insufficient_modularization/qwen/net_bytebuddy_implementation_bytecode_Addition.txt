    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Addition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Addition is a well-designed enum with a single responsibility: representing stack manipulations for adding two numbers. It has only 4 fields, 1 constructor, and 2 methods (isValid and apply), all directly related to its core purpose. The class is small, cohesive, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. It properly encapsulates the different types of addition operations (INTEGER, LONG, FLOAT, DOUBLE) and their corresponding opcodes and stack sizes, making it a good example of sufficient modularization."
