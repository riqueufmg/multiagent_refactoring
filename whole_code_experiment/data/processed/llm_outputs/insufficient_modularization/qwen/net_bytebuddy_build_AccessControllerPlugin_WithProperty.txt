    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class AccessControllerPlugin.WithProperty is a well-defined inner class with a single responsibility: initializing a field based on the availability of the AccessController and a system property. It contains only the necessary logic for this specific task, does not exhibit excessive size or complexity, and maintains a cohesive abstraction. The class properly delegates responsibilities and does not mix concerns, thus avoiding the Insufficient Modularization smell."
