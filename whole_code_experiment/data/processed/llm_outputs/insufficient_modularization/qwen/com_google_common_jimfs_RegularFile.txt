        "The class is of moderate size (5342 characters) and is focused on byte-level file operations, block management, and synchronization.",

        "There is no evidence of excessive complexity, bloated interface, or mixing of unrelated responsibilities.",
        "The use of helper methods and clear separation of concerns (e.g., locking, block operations, I/O operations) indicates sufficient modularization."
