        "The class 'CachedReturnPlugin.AdviceResolver' is an enum with a large amount of functionality embedded within it, including defining dynamic types, creating bytecode appenders, and handling advice resolution logic.",
        "It contains complex nested classes such as 'ExitAdviceByteCodeAppender' and 'CacheFieldOffsetMapping', which are defined within the enum, increasing its size and complexity.",
        "The constructor of the enum performs significant initialization work, including building dynamic types using ByteBuddy, which contributes to the class being large and doing too much.",
        "The class handles multiple responsibilities: resolving advice based on type, generating bytecode for method exit advice, and managing field offset mappings.",
        "Such concentration of responsibilities and the substantial amount of code within a single enum type indicate that the abstraction has not been adequately decomposed, making it harder to understand and maintain."
