        "The class has a clear and focused responsibility as a FileStore implementation for jimfs.",
        "It properly delegates responsibilities to other specialized classes: FileTree for lookup operations, FileFactory for file creation, HeapDisk for disk space management, and AttributeService for attribute handling as stated in the class documentation.",
        "The class follows the Facade pattern by providing a single API to access functionality from multiple underlying services without exposing their complexity.",
        "It maintains appropriate cohesion with all methods relating to file store operations such as file lookup, creation, attribute handling, and space management.",
        "The class has reasonable size with well-defined methods that are not overly complex.",
        "There is no evidence of bloated interface or excessive complexity that would indicate insufficient decomposition."
