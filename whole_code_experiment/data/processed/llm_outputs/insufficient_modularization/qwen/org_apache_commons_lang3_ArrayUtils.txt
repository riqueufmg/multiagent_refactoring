        "The class 'ArrayUtils' has an excessive number of methods (over 200), which indicates a high level of complexity and responsibility.",
        "The class handles operations for various types (primitives and objects), which could be separated into type-specific utility classes.",
        "The class contains multiple overloaded methods for similar operations (e.g., add, remove, indexOf, contains, etc.) for different array types, increasing its size and complexity.",
        "There is a lack of clear separation of concerns as the class manages utilities for arrays of all primitive types and object arrays, making it difficult to maintain and evolve."
