    "detection": true,
    "justification": [
        "The class 'TypeProxy' is excessively large and complex, containing multiple nested classes (AbstractMethodErrorThrow, SilentConstruction, Appender, MethodCall, Appender, AccessorMethodInvocation) and interfaces (InvocationFactory) that could be separated into their own cohesive abstractions.",
        "The class has multiple responsibilities including creating proxy types, handling different invocation strategies, managing bytecode manipulation, and defining various stack manipulations for proxy construction.",
        "The MethodCall inner class itself contains multiple levels of nested classes (Appender, AccessorMethodInvocation) that add to the overall complexity and size of the outer class.",
        "The class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by combining proxy creation logic, bytecode generation, serialization handling, and method invocation strategies all within a single class structure.",
        "The extensive use of inner classes and enums for specific functionalities indicates that these could be extracted into separate, more maintainable classes."
