    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ParserCollectionStrategy is focused on a single responsibility: collecting project roots by walking file trees and identifying Java source files. Its size is moderate, and it does not expose a bloated interface. The internal logic, while non-trivial, is cohesive and directly related to its core purpose. There is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or excessive complexity that would warrant decomposition into smaller classes."
