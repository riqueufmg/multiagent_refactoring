        "It contains multiple nested classes (VariantAction, RuntimeClassPathResolver, ByteBuddyTransformationConfiguration, etc.) that handle distinct responsibilities, suggesting a lack of proper decomposition.",
        "The class handles various concerns such as plugin application, variant processing, configuration management, dependency resolution, and transformation dispatching, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.",
        "Complex conditional logic and reflection-based API usage increase the overall complexity and reduce maintainability.",
        "The presence of multiple inner classes and interfaces (TransformationDispatcher, ByteBuddyViewConfiguration, etc.) further indicates that the class is managing too many abstractions at once."
