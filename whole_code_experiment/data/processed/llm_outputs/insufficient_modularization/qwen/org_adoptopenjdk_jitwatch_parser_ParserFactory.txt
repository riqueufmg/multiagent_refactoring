    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ParserFactory is a simple factory class with a single responsibility - creating parser instances based on parser type. It has only one method (getParser) and a private constructor, making it small, focused, and well-cohesive. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. It properly delegates the actual parsing responsibilities to specialized parser classes (HotSpotLogParser, J9LogParser, ZingLogParser) rather than implementing complex logic itself."
