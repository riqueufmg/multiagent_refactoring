    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "DimensionHelpers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class DimensionHelpers is a utility class with a clear, single responsibility: handling array dimension extraction and reordering. It contains only 3 methods (extractDims, reorderBySourcePosition, and a helper extractDims), which are all closely related to its core purpose. The class is small (less than 100 lines), has low complexity, and maintains good cohesion. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
