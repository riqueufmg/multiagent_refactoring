    "justification": [
        "The class has a large number of lines of code and contains multiple responsibilities such as encoding logic for different modes (C40, Text, X12, EDIFACT, Base256), lookahead testing, character type checking, and macro handling.",
        "It directly manages encoding context and control flow for various encoding strategies instead of delegating to specialized classes.",
        "The class includes many static methods and constants related to different encoding modes, which indicates a lack of decomposition into separate, cohesive abstractions.",
        "Complex conditional logic is present in methods like `lookAheadTestIntern`, increasing the complexity and making the class harder to understand and maintain."
