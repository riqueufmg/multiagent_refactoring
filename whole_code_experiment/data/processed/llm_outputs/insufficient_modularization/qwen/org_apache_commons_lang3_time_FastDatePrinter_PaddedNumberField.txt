    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "FastDatePrinter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FastDatePrinter is large but well-structured with clear separation of concerns through inner classes and interfaces (e.g., Rule, NumberRule, PaddedNumberField). Each inner class has a single responsibility and encapsulates specific formatting logic. The class follows the factory method pattern for rule creation and maintains a clear public interface. While it contains many lines of code, the decomposition into smaller, cohesive inner classes prevents it from suffering insufficient modularization."
