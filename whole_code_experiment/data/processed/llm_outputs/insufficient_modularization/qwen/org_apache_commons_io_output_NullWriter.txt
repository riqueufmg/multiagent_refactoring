    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class NullWriter is a small, focused class with a single responsibility: to act as a Writer that discards all input. It has only 13 methods, most of which are simple overrides of Writer methods that perform minimal operations (often just validation or no operation at all). The class is well-cohesive, with all methods directly related to the null writer abstraction. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
