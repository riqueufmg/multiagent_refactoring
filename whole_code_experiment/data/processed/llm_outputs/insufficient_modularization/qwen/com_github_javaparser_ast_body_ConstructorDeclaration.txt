    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The ConstructorDeclaration class is well-factored and maintains a clear, cohesive responsibility related to representing and manipulating constructor declarations in Java code. It encapsulates constructor-specific properties such as body, parameters, modifiers, and type parameters, while inheriting general callable declaration features from its superclass. The class implements relevant interfaces for structured access to its properties and provides necessary methods for AST node operations like cloning, visiting, and resolving. Its size and complexity are appropriate for its role in the JavaParser library, and there is no evidence of bloated interfaces or concentrated responsibilities that would suggest a need for further decomposition."
