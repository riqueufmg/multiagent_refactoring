    "justification": "The class ByteBuddySimpleTaskExtension is small and focused, containing only 7 methods and 1 field. It has a single responsibility of managing the discovery set for ByteBuddy tasks. The class properly extends AbstractByteBuddyTaskExtension and implements required configuration methods without excessive complexity or bloated interface. No signs of inadequate decomposition or concentration of unrelated responsibilities were found."
