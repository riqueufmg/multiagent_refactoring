        "The class MemberSubstitution.ForMatchedByteCodeElement is a nested class within the larger MemberSubstitution class, which itself is highly complex and large (73359 lines context size).",
        "However, ForMatchedByteCodeElement specifically is relatively small and focused, implementing only the logic required for handling matched bytecode elements within the substitution framework.",
        "It has a single responsibility: to represent a member substitution that requires a specification for how to replace a bytecode element, and it correctly implements this responsibility without excessive complexity.",
        "Its size is modest, with only one field (matcher) and a few methods, primarily focused on construction and the replaceWith method which integrates with the broader MemberSubstitution framework.",
        "The class does not exhibit signs of bloated interface or excessive complexity; it's a well-scoped component within the larger design.",
        "Therefore, while the outer MemberSubstitution class may exhibit Insufficient Modularization, the inner class ForMatchedByteCodeElement does not meet the criteria for this smell."
