    "justification": "The class Clazz is extremely simple, containing only a basic enum MyEnum with two values (A, B) and minimal constructor logic. The class has very low complexity, small size, and a simple interface. There are no signs of inadequate decomposition or concentration of multiple responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
