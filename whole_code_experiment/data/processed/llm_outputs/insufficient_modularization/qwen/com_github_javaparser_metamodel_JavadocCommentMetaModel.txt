    "justification": "The class JavadocCommentMetaModel is a generated meta-model class with minimal functionality. It only contains a constructor and a protected constructor, inheriting from CommentMetaModel. The class is small, focused, and serves a single purpose of representing metadata for JavadocComment nodes. It does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
