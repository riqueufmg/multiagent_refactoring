    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of dispatching requests using either HttpClient or HttpURLConnection. It is small in size (less than 619 characters as per CONTEXT_SIZE), has low complexity, and does not expose a bloated interface. The class encapsulates the logic for determining which executor to use and handles fallback behavior appropriately, without mixing concerns or duplicating responsibilities that could be separated into smaller abstractions."
