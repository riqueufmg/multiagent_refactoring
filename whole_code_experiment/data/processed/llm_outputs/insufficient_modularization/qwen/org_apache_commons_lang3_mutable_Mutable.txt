    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Mutable interface is appropriately sized and focused on a single responsibility: providing mutable access to a value. It defines a minimal and cohesive abstraction with only three methods (get, getValue, setValue), one of which is deprecated and properly delegating to the default get() method. The interface adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle and does not exhibit excessive complexity, size, or a bloated interface. It serves as a generic interface for mutable value holders, which is a clear and well-defined purpose."
