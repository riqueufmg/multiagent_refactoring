    "class": "CollectionTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CollectionTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter is well-focused with a single responsibility of adapting collections for JSON serialization/deserialization. It contains only essential fields (elementTypeAdapter, constructor) and methods (read, write) directly related to its purpose. The class is small in size, has high cohesion, and does not expose a bloated interface. There is no evidence of excessive complexity or concentration of unrelated responsibilities that would warrant further decomposition."
