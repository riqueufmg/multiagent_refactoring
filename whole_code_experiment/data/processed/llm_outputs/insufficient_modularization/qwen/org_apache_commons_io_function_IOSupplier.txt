    "justification": "The class IOSupplier is a functional interface with only three methods, including two default methods and one abstract method. It has a clear and focused responsibility of representing a supplier that can throw IOException. The class is small, cohesive, and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
