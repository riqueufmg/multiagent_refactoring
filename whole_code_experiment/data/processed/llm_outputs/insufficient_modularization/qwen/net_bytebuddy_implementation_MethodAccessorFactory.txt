    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MethodAccessorFactory is an interface with a clear and focused responsibility of defining a factory for creating method proxies. It contains only four methods that are closely related to its core purpose, and an enum AccessType that defines access types for the factory methods. Additionally, it includes an Illegal enum implementation that serves as a specific implementation forbidding accessor registration. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. The responsibilities are well-cohesive and adequately decomposed, with no indication that further decomposition would improve maintainability or understanding."
