    "justification": "The class ElisionTest is a simple test class with a single responsibility - to demonstrate vector operations and synchronization elision. It contains only a constructor with straightforward logic and a main method for execution. The class is small, focused, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
