    "justification": [
        "The class 'TypeProxy' is excessively large and complex, containing multiple nested classes (AbstractMethodErrorThrow, SilentConstruction, Appender, MethodCall, Appender, AccessorMethodInvocation) and enums (InvocationFactory.Default) that could be separated into their own files or modules.",
        "It has too many responsibilities including proxy creation, method interception, bytecode manipulation, and handling different types of method invocations (super method, default method, reflection-based construction).",
        "The class manages various concerns such as serialization logic, finalizer handling, constructor delegation, and stack manipulation operations, which are not cohesive and increase the overall complexity.",
        "Several inner classes like 'SilentConstruction.Appender' and 'MethodCall.Appender' contain significant amounts of implementation details that contribute to the bloat and make the class harder to understand and maintain."
