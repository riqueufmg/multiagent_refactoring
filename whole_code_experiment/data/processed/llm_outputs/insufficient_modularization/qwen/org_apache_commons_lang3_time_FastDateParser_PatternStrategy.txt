    "justification": [
        "The class has excessive size with multiple nested static classes (CaseInsensitiveTextStrategy, CopyQuotedStrategy, ISO8601TimeZoneStrategy, NumberStrategy, PatternStrategy, Strategy, StrategyAndWidth, StrategyParser, TimeZoneStrategy) that increase its complexity and make it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "The class concentrates too many responsibilities including pattern parsing, strategy management, calendar manipulation, and various parsing strategies for different field types, rather than delegating these to separate cohesive abstractions.",
        "The class has a bloated interface with numerous private static final Strategy fields and complex initialization logic, making it hard to evolve and modify individual components independently.",
        "The extensive use of inner classes for different parsing strategies indicates that these could be separated into their own modules or classes to improve cohesion and reduce the complexity of the main FastDateParser class."
