    "justification": [
        "The class has excessive size with numerous nested interfaces, enums, and complex logic for handling module system integration.",
        "It contains multiple responsibilities including module layer creation, class loading delegation, dynamic type generation, and proxy interface definitions.",
        "The class implements complex module system operations through nested proxy interfaces (ModuleDescriptor, ModuleLayer, Configuration, etc.) that could be separated into distinct modules.",
        "Contains deeply nested logic in the Factory enum's make method with complex error handling and module resolution logic.",
        "Includes abstract classes (AbstractModuleReader, AbstractModuleFinder) that are tightly coupled to the main class rather than being properly separated.",
        "The class handles both module system abstraction and class loading decoration, violating single responsibility principle.",
        "Large number of imported dependencies and complex constructor logic indicate high complexity and inadequate decomposition."
