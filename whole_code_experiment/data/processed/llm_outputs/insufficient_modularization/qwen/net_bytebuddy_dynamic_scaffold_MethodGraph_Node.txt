        "The MethodGraph interface contains multiple nested interfaces, enums, and classes (Node, Linked, Compiler, NodeList, Simple) which increases its complexity and size significantly.",
        "The nested Default compiler class within Compiler is extremely large and complex, containing multiple inner classes (Harmonizer, Merger, Key, Store, Entry, etc.) and extensive logic for method graph compilation.",
        "The class represents multiple abstractions (method graph representation, node management, compilation logic, harmonization, merging) that are not adequately separated into distinct, cohesive modules.",
        "The extensive use of nested classes and interfaces within MethodGraph leads to a bloated interface and makes the class difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve."
