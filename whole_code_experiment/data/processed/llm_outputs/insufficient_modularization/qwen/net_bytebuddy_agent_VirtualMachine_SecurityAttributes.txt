    "justification": [
        "The VirtualMachine class is excessively large with 21485 lines, containing multiple nested classes (ForHotSpot, ForOpenJ9, Connection hierarchy, Dispatcher hierarchy) that implement different platform-specific attachment mechanisms",
        "The class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by combining interface definitions, multiple platform-specific implementations, abstract base classes, and utility classes all within a single file",
        "The class has a bloated interface with numerous methods (getSystemProperties, getAgentProperties, loadAgent, loadAgentPath, loadAgentLibrary, startManagementAgent, startLocalManagementAgent, detach) that are implemented differently across nested classes",
        "Platform-specific logic for Windows, POSIX, Solaris, and OpenJ9 is all contained within the same class structure rather than being properly decomposed into separate modules",
        "The nested class hierarchy creates excessive complexity with multiple levels of abstraction (Connection -> ForJnaPosixSocket -> PosixLibrary, etc.) making the class difficult to understand and maintain",
        "The class concentrates too many responsibilities including VM attachment, property management, socket communication, security attributes handling, and platform-specific process management"
