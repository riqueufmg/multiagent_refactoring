    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of wrapping a FilterReader to convert IOExceptions to UncheckedIOExceptions. It contains only essential methods that directly relate to this core functionality. The class is small in size, has low complexity, and maintains a cohesive interface. While it does contain multiple read() method overloads and other I/O operations, these are all variations of the same fundamental behavior (unchecked I/O operations) rather than distinct responsibilities. The builder pattern implementation is also appropriately encapsulated within the class without introducing unrelated concerns."
