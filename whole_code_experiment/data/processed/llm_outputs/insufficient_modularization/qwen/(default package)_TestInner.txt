    "justification": "The class TestInner is relatively small and simple, with only 32 lines of code. It has a clear single responsibility of demonstrating inner class behavior. The nested inner classes (Inner1, Inner2) are logically related and serve to demonstrate the hierarchical relationship. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface - it has only one public method (a()) and a straightforward constructor chain. The nested classes each have single responsibilities and minimal interfaces."
