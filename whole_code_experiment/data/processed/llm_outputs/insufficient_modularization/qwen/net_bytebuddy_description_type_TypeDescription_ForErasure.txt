        "The TypeDescription interface is extremely large, containing over 66,000 lines of code, which indicates excessive size and complexity",
        "The class encompasses numerous nested interfaces and classes (Generic, ForLoadedType, AbstractBase, etc.) that handle diverse responsibilities including type representation, generic type handling, annotation processing, and type relationship calculations",
        "The interface defines a bloated API with dozens of methods covering type inspection, comparison, conversion, and navigation, making it difficult to understand and maintain",
        "Responsibilities are not adequately separated - the class handles both simple type descriptions and complex generic type manipulations, as well as annotation processing and type variable management",
        "The extensive nesting of classes and interfaces within the main TypeDescription interface indicates a lack of proper decomposition into smaller, more cohesive abstractions"
