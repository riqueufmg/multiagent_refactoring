    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MatrixToImageConfig is a small, cohesive configuration class with only 42 lines of code. It has a single responsibility of encapsulating configuration for matrix to image conversion, with clear and focused methods. The class contains only essential fields (onColor, offColor) and methods directly related to configuration management and color model determination. There is no excessive complexity, bloated interface, or concentrated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
