    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class NullReader is well-designed with a single responsibility of emulating a Reader of a specified size. It has a clear and focused purpose, with all methods directly related to the core functionality of simulating a Reader. The class is relatively small (approximately 200 lines), has a cohesive set of methods that work together to fulfill its purpose, and provides extension points through protected methods for customization. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. It properly encapsulates its state and provides a clean, understandable API. Therefore, it does not demonstrate the characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
