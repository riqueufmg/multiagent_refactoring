    "justification": "The class is minimal and well-focused, serving only as an entry point for preferences UI. It contains only essential constants for preference keys and a simple onCreate method that delegates to a PreferencesFragment. The class properly separates concerns by delegating UI management to the fragment, maintaining good cohesion and single responsibility."
