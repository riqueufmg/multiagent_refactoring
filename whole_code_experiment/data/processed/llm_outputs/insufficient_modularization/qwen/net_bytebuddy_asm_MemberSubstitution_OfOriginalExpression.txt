        "The class 'MemberSubstitution' has excessive size with a large number of nested classes and extensive functionality related to member substitution, making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "The class encompasses multiple responsibilities including member matching, replacement logic, substitution chaining, and bytecode manipulation, violating the single responsibility principle.",
        "Complexity is increased due to numerous inner classes such as 'WithoutSpecification', 'ForMatchedDynamicInvocation', 'ForMatchedByteCodeElement', 'ForMatchedField', 'ForMatchedMethod', 'Substitution', 'Chain', 'Step', 'ForDelegation', etc., each handling different aspects of member substitution.",
        "The class contains deeply nested hierarchies and complex control flow logic for handling various bytecode elements like fields, methods, constructors, and invokedynamic instructions.",
        "Large number of methods and fields indicating bloated interface and implementation, suggesting the need for decomposition into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
