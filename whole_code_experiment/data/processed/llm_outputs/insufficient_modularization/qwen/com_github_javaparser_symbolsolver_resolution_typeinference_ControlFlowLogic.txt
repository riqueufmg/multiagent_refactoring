        "The class has excessive size and complexity due to embedding a large anonymous GenericVisitor implementation within the canCompleteNormally method, which handles multiple control flow statement types.",
        "The class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by combining control flow logic for various statement types (if, block, loop, switch, etc.) into a single class rather than decomposing them into separate, cohesive abstractions.",
        "The isReachable method contains commented-out code covering multiple statement types, indicating incomplete decomposition of responsibilities.",
        "Multiple methods like canCompleteNormally and isReachable contain complex visitor patterns with multiple nested conditional logic, increasing cognitive load and maintenance difficulty.",
        "The class has a bloated interface with methods handling different aspects of control flow analysis (breakTarget, exitTheStatement, continueADoStatement) that could be separated into more focused classes."
