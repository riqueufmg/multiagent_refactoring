    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TextViewerStage is reasonably small and focused on a single responsibility - creating and displaying a text viewer stage with optional line numbers and formatting. The constructor handles text processing and UI component creation but does not exhibit excessive complexity or bloated interface. The class extends AbstractTextViewerStage suggesting proper inheritance usage and does not contain multiple unrelated responsibilities that would warrant decomposition."
