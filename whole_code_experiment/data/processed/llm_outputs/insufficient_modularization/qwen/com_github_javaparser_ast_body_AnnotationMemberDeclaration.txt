    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "AnnotationMemberDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class AnnotationMemberDeclaration is well-focused, representing a single responsibility related to annotation member declarations in Java. It has a manageable size with clear fields (modifiers, type, name, defaultValue) and methods that handle properties, visitor patterns, cloning, and resolution logic. The class leverages multiple interfaces to provide specific behaviors (e.g., NodeWithJavadoc, NodeWithType), which promotes modular design rather than bloating the class. There is no evidence of excessive complexity, duplicated logic, or intertwined responsibilities that would indicate insufficient decomposition."
