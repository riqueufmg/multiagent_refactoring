    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class PackageDescription.AbstractBase is a well-defined abstract base implementation with only 5 methods (getInternalName, getActualName, contains, isDefault, hashCode, equals, toString) and clear responsibilities. It properly delegates concrete implementations to subclasses (Simple and ForLoadedPackage) and maintains a cohesive interface. The class is small, focused, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface."
