    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class PolymorphismTest, while containing multiple nested classes and a main method, maintains a clear and focused responsibility centered around demonstrating polymorphism behavior. The nested classes (Nickel, Dime, Quarter) are simple implementations of the Coin interface, each with a single responsibility. The constructor contains a test loop that exercises polymorphic behavior, which aligns with the class's purpose. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would warrant decomposition into smaller abstractions."
