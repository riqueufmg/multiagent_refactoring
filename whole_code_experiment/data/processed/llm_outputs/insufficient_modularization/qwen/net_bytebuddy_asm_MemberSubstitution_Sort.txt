    "justification": [
        "The class 'MemberSubstitution' is excessively large with numerous nested classes and interfaces, indicating a lack of proper decomposition.",
        "It encompasses multiple responsibilities including member substitution logic, handling different types of substitutions (fields, methods, constructors, dynamic invocations), replacement mechanisms, and bytecode manipulation.",
        "The class contains deeply nested hierarchies like 'WithoutSpecification' with multiple inner classes ('ForMatchedDynamicInvocation', 'ForMatchedByteCodeElement', etc.) which increases complexity and reduces cohesion.",
        "The presence of extensive inline documentation and numerous methods suggests the class is doing too much and could benefit from being split into smaller, more focused classes."
