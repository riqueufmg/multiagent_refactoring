        "The JavaToken.Kind enum is a well-encapsulated component responsible for representing token kinds in the JavaParser library.",
        "It contains a reasonable number of constants (152) that correspond to different token types in the Java language, which is appropriate for its purpose.",
        "The class provides essential methods such as valueOf(int kind), isPrimitive(), and getKind(), which are cohesive and directly related to token kind management.",
        "The switch statement in valueOf(int kind) is a standard and efficient way to map integer values to enum constants, and its size is justified by the number of token types.",
        "There is no evidence of excessive complexity, bloated interface, or mixing of responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization.",
        "The class is focused solely on representing and managing token kinds, adhering to the single responsibility principle."
