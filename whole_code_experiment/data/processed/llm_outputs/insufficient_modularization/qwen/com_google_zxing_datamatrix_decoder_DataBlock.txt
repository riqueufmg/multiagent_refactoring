    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "DataBlock",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a clear single responsibility of encapsulating data blocks and providing a factory method to de-interleave raw codewords into data blocks. While the getDataBlocks method is complex, it represents a cohesive algorithm for data block reconstruction that logically belongs together. The class has only 3 methods (constructor, getDataBlocks, and 2 simple getters) and 2 fields, which is not excessive. The complexity is inherent to the data matrix decoding process rather than due to poor modularization."
