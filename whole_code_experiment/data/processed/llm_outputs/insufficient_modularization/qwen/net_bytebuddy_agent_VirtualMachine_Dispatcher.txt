        "The class contains multiple responsibilities including virtual machine abstraction, platform-specific implementations for HotSpot and OpenJ9, various connection mechanisms (POSIX sockets, Windows named pipes, Solaris doors), and native library interactions.",
        "The ForHotSpot nested class alone contains extensive platform-specific code for different operating systems (Windows, Solaris, POSIX) with complex connection logic that should be decomposed.",
        "The class has a bloated interface with numerous methods for different agent loading operations (loadAgent, loadAgentPath, loadAgentLibrary) and management operations (startManagementAgent, startLocalManagementAgent).",
        "Platform-specific implementations are tightly coupled within the class hierarchy rather than being properly modularized into separate, cohesive abstractions."
