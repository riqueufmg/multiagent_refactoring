    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MethodRebaseResolver is well-decomposed into multiple cohesive inner interfaces and classes, each with distinct responsibilities. The main interface defines core contract methods, while nested classes like Resolution.Preserved, Resolution.ForRebasedMethod, and Resolution.ForRebasedConstructor handle specific resolution cases. The Default implementation manages the resolution mapping and auxiliary types without excessive complexity. The class maintains clear separation of concerns, with each component having a single responsibility, and does not exhibit bloated interfaces or excessive size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
