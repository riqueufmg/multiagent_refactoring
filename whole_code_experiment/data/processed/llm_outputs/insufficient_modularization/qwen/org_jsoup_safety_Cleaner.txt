    "justification": "The Cleaner class is well-focused on its core responsibility of sanitizing HTML documents based on a safelist. It has a clear public API with methods for cleaning documents and validating HTML content. The class encapsulates related functionality logically, uses appropriate helper classes (CleaningVisitor, ElementMeta) for internal operations, and maintains good cohesion. The size and complexity are reasonable for its functionality, and it doesn't expose a bloated interface. The internal classes CleaningVisitor and ElementMeta properly encapsulate their functionality, contributing to the overall modularization of the class."
