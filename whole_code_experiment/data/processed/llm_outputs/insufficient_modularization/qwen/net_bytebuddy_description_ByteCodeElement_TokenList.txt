    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ByteCodeElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ByteCodeElement is an interface that defines a clear abstraction for byte code elements. While it contains several nested interfaces (TypeDependant, Member, Token) and the Token interface includes a nested TokenList class, the overall structure maintains good cohesion around the concept of byte code elements. The class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient decomposition. Each nested component serves a distinct purpose related to byte code element representation and manipulation, suggesting adequate modularization rather than bloated or overly complex design."
