    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CachingMatcher.WithInlineEviction is reasonably small and focused, implementing only cache eviction logic as an extension of CachingMatcher. It has a single responsibility of managing cache size by evicting entries when the limit is reached. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. It encapsulates a specific behavior (inline eviction) without mixing unrelated concerns, thus does not represent an abstraction that has been inadequately decomposed."
