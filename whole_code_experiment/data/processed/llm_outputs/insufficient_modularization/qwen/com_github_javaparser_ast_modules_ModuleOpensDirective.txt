    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ModuleOpensDirective is a well-defined, cohesive class representing a specific AST node for module opens directives. It has a clear single responsibility, encapsulating the name and module names associated with an opens directive. The class is of moderate size, with fields, constructors, and methods that are all directly related to its purpose. There is no evidence of excessive complexity, bloated interface, or concentration of unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
