        "The AbstractBase class implements numerous interfaces and contains over 50 methods that handle various modifier checks and state retrievals, leading to excessive size and complexity.",
        "Responsibilities span across different abstraction levels including type, field, method, parameter, and module descriptions, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive classes.",
        "The class exposes a bloated interface with many public methods catering to different types of bytecode elements, making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "The single AbstractBase class tries to fulfill the contract for all modifier reviewable elements, violating the Interface Segregation Principle and increasing cognitive load on developers."
