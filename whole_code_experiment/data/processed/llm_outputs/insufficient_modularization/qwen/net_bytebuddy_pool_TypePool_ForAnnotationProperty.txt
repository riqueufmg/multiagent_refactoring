        "The class TypePool.ForAnnotationProperty is a nested class within the large TypePool interface, but it is relatively small and focused in scope.",

        "The class has a clear and limited set of responsibilities with only a few methods and inner classes.",

        "It properly encapsulates its functionality and doesn't expose unnecessary implementation details.",
        "The class follows good design principles with appropriate separation of concerns within its limited scope."
