        "The Evaluator class is excessively large, containing 504 lines of code and multiple nested static classes that represent distinct responsibilities.",
        "It encompasses a wide variety of evaluation logic (e.g., tag matching, attribute matching, index-based matching, text matching) within a single class, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.",
        "The class contains 28 inner static classes, each implementing specific evaluation criteria, which indicates a lack of decomposition into separate, more cohesive abstractions.",
        "The bloated interface makes it difficult to understand and maintain, as changes to one evaluation type may impact the overall class structure.",
        "Despite being abstract, the class aggregates too many related but distinct functionalities that could be better separated into smaller modules or classes."
