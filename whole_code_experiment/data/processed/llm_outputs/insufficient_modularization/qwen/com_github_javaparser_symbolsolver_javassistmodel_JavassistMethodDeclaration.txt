    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "JavassistMethodDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JavassistMethodDeclaration has a clear and focused responsibility of representing a method declaration using Javassist. It delegates appropriately to JavassistMethodLikeDeclarationAdapter for parameter, type parameter, and exception handling, and to JavassistFactory for type and access level conversions. The class has a manageable number of methods, each serving a distinct purpose related to method declaration resolution. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
