        "The class 'AsmClassWriter' is an interface that defines a clear abstraction for creating ClassVisitor instances and obtaining binary representations of class files.",
        "It is properly decomposed into several cohesive inner classes and interfaces, each with distinct responsibilities: 'Factory', 'ForAsm', 'ForClassFileApi', 'FrameComputingClassWriter', and 'SuperClassResolvingJdkClassWriter'.",
        "The 'Factory' interface and its 'Default' enum implementation provide a well-structured way to handle different class writer creation strategies without bloating the main interface.",
        "Each inner class has a single responsibility and encapsulates specific functionality related to different class writing mechanisms (ASM-based, Class File API-based, frame computing, etc.).",
        "The complexity of handling different class writing strategies is appropriately distributed across specialized components rather than being concentrated in a single class.",
        "The interface and its implementations maintain a clean separation of concerns, with each component being reasonably sized and focused."
