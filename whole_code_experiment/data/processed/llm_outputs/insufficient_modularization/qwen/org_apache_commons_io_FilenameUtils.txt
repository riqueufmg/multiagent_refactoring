    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "FilenameUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FilenameUtils has excessive size (over 17000 characters) and contains numerous methods (more than 50 public static methods) that handle various file name manipulations. While all methods are related to file name operations, the class concentrates too many responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. The class handles path normalization, extension handling, wildcard matching, directory containment checks, and various utility functions, which indicates a bloated interface and high complexity. Although it operates on a single abstraction (file names/paths), the sheer number of operations and the complexity of some methods (like doNormalize with over 100 lines) suggest that responsibilities could be better distributed into more focused classes or modules."
