    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The VoidVisitor interface, while large, represents a single cohesive abstraction - a visitor for AST nodes. All methods are related to the visitor pattern implementation and serve a unified purpose of visiting different types of AST nodes. The interface does not contain implementation code, and the large number of methods is inherent to the visitor pattern design for a comprehensive AST. The interface maintains good cohesion as all methods contribute to the same abstraction."
