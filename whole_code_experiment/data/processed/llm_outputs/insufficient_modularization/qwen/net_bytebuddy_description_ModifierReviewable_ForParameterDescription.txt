        "The class implements multiple interfaces (ForTypeDefinition, ForFieldDescription, ForMethodDescription, ForParameterDescription, ForModuleDescription, ForModuleRequirement) which represent distinct abstraction responsibilities.",
        "The class contains a large number of methods (30+ public methods) that handle different types of modifiers for various Java elements (types, fields, methods, parameters, modules).",
        "The class has multiple reasons to change - it needs modification when any of the different modifier types or Java elements it handles are changed.",
        "The class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by consolidating logic for handling modifiers across different domains (types, fields, methods, parameters, modules) rather than decomposing them into specialized classes.",
        "The high number of implemented interfaces and methods indicates excessive complexity and a bloated interface that makes the class difficult to understand and maintain."
