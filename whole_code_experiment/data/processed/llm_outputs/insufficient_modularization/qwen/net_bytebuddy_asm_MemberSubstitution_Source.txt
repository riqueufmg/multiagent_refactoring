        "The class 'MemberSubstitution' is excessively large with a size of 73355 bytes, indicating high complexity and potential difficulty in understanding and maintaining the code.",
        "The class contains multiple nested classes and interfaces (e.g., 'WithoutSpecification', 'TypePoolResolver', 'Target', 'Substitution', 'Replacement', 'SubstitutingMethodVisitor') which increases its complexity and suggests that it might be handling too many responsibilities.",
        "The class implements multiple interfaces ('AsmVisitorWrapper.ForDeclaredMethods.MethodVisitorWrapper') and contains numerous methods, fields, and nested types, indicating a high degree of coupling and a bloated interface.",
        "The presence of multiple levels of nested classes and interfaces within 'MemberSubstitution' (e.g., 'Substitution.Chain.Step.ForDelegation.OffsetMapping.ForFieldHandle.Unresolved.WithExplicitType') suggests that the class has not been adequately decomposed into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
