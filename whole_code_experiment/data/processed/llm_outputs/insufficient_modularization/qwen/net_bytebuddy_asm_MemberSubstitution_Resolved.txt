        "The class 'MemberSubstitution.Resolved' is a nested class within 'MemberSubstitution' and contributes to the overall complexity and size of the outer class structure.",
        "The outer class 'MemberSubstitution' is extremely large (over 7000 lines) and contains numerous nested classes, interfaces, and complex logic for bytecode manipulation, indicating a violation of the single responsibility principle.",
        "The class 'MemberSubstitution.Resolved' itself is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, but given the structure and the extensive responsibilities of 'MemberSubstitution', it is part of a bloated design that does not adequately decompose functionality.",
        "The presence of multiple levels of nested classes and interfaces (e.g., 'WithoutSpecification', 'Target', 'Substitution', 'Replacement', 'Chain', 'Step', 'OffsetMapping', 'Dispatcher', 'BootstrapArgumentResolver') indicates that the class takes on too many responsibilities and lacks proper modularization.",
        "The class handles various concerns such as method/field matching, substitution logic, delegation, dynamic invocation, and bytecode manipulation, which should ideally be separated into distinct, cohesive modules."
