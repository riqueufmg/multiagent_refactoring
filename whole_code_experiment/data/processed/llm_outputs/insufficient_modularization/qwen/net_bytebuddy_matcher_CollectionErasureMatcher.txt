    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of matching collections of types by their erasures. It contains only essential methods (constructor, doMatch, toString) with clear purposes. The implementation is concise and focused, without excessive complexity or bloated interfaces. There are no signs of multiple responsibilities or inadequate decomposition."
