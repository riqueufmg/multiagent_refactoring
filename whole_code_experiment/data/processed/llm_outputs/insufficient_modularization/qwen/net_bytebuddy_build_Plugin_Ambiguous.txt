    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Plugin.Ambiguous is a nested class within the Plugin interface and serves a single, well-defined purpose: to represent an ambiguously resolved instantiator for plugin constructors. It has a clear responsibility, encapsulated state (left and right constructors, priority, parameters), and focused behavior (replaceBy, instantiate methods). The class is small in size and complexity, adhering to the single responsibility principle. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
