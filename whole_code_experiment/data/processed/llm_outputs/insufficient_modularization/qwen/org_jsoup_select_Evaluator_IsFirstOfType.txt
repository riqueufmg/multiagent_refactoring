        "The Evaluator class is excessively large, containing 504 lines of code and housing 35 inner classes that represent distinct evaluation criteria.",
        "It has a bloated interface with numerous public and protected methods such as matches(Element root, Element element), matches(Element root, Node node), asPredicate(Element root), cost(), reset(), and wantsNodes().",
        "The class concentrates multiple responsibilities including various attribute evaluations, index-based selections, text matching, and pseudo-class handling, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.",
        "The presence of a large number of static nested classes indicates that the class is trying to encapsulate too much functionality, violating the principle of single responsibility."
