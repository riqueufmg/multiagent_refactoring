        "The class 'TypeProxy' is excessively large, containing 5778 lines of code, which indicates high complexity and lack of proper decomposition.",
        "It encompasses multiple responsibilities including proxy creation, method interception, bytecode manipulation, and handling different invocation strategies (e.g., super method, default method, reflection-based construction).",
        "Nested classes such as 'SilentConstruction', 'ForSuperMethodByConstructor', 'ForSuperMethodByReflectionFactory', 'ForDefaultMethod', and 'MethodCall' along with their inner classes increase the overall complexity and size of the class.",
        "The 'MethodCall' class contains further nested classes like 'Appender' and 'AccessorMethodInvocation', contributing to deep nesting and increased cognitive load.",
        "Several enum types ('AbstractMethodErrorThrow', 'SilentConstruction', 'InvocationFactory.Default') are defined within the class, adding to its bulk and responsibilities.",
        "The class manages various aspects of type proxying from construction logic to bytecode generation, violating the Single Responsibility Principle."
