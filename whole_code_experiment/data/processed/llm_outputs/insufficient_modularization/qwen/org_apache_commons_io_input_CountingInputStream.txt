    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "CountingInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of counting bytes passed through an InputStream. It is relatively small in size (approximately 150 lines including comments and whitespace), has low complexity, and maintains a cohesive interface. The methods are focused on byte counting operations (getting counts, resetting counts, handling reads and skips), which aligns with its purpose as a decorator pattern implementation. There is no evidence of bloated interfaces or concentrated responsibilities that could be separated into smaller abstractions."
