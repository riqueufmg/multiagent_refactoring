    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Initialization is small and focused, containing only three fields (entryPoint, validated, and inherited fields from CoordinateConfiguration), a simple constructor, and a single method (getEntryPoint) that handles entry point resolution. The class has a clear and cohesive responsibility of managing Maven build initialization configuration and entry point resolution. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
