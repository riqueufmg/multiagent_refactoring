    "class": "RecordComponentDescription.InDefinedShape",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class RecordComponentDescription.InDefinedShape is an interface that defines a clear and cohesive abstraction for record component descriptions in their defined shape. It has a well-defined responsibility, a small and focused set of methods, and does not exhibit excessive size or complexity. The class delegates implementation details to inner classes (e.g., AbstractBase) and maintains a clean separation of concerns. There is no evidence of bloated interfaces or concentrated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
