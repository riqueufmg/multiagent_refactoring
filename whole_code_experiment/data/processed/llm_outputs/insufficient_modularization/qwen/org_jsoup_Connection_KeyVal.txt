        "The Connection interface contains 68 methods, which indicates a large interface that may be handling too many responsibilities.",
        "The class encompasses multiple abstraction levels including HTTP methods, request/response handling, authentication, SSL configuration, data parameters, headers, cookies, and parsing logic.",
        "Nested interfaces (Method, Base, Request, Response, KeyVal) within the same file suggest that the main Connection interface is acting as a container for multiple related but distinct abstractions.",
        "The presence of numerous default methods (e.g., newRequest(String), sslContext(SSLContext), requestBodyStream(InputStream), onResponseProgress(Progress<Response>), readBody(), readFully(), streamParser()) indicates added complexity and potential bloating of the interface.",
        "The extensive documentation and numerous configuration options suggest that the interface is trying to cover too broad a range of functionalities rather than being focused on a single responsibility."
