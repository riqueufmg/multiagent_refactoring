        "The class 'Implementation' is extremely large (over 1700 lines) and encompasses many nested interfaces, enums, and classes, making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "It contains multiple abstraction levels and responsibilities, such as defining the core Implementation interface, handling special method invocations, managing implementation targets, and dealing with context and frame generation.",
        "The class includes several nested complex types like SpecialMethodInvocation with its own hierarchy (Illegal, AbstractBase, Simple), Target with its own nested types, and Context with extensive nested implementations (Default, Disabled, etc.).",
        "The FrameGeneration enum alone contains significant logic for frame management, which could be separated into its own class or package.",
        "The Context interface has a deeply nested structure with ExtractableView, Default, Disabled, and numerous supporting classes (CacheValueField, FieldCacheEntry, AccessorMethod, etc.), indicating a lack of proper decomposition.",
        "The Compound and Simple implementations, while smaller, are still part of the main class structure rather than being separated into distinct, focused classes.",
        "The class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by managing too many concerns: interface definitions, method invocation handling, context management, frame generation, and auxiliary type handling."
