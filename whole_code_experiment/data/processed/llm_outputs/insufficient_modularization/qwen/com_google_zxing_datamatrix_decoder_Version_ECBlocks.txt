    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Version",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Version is well-focused on representing a Data Matrix Code version with clear responsibilities. It encapsulates version-specific data and provides a method to deduce version from dimensions. The nested classes ECBlocks and ECB are logically related and kept within the same file for cohesion, which is acceptable given their tight coupling to Version. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. The total line count is reasonable for its functionality, and the methods are cohesive and well-named, supporting maintainability and understandability."
