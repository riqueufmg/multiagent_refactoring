        "The class Plugin.CompoundIterator is a nested class within the Plugin interface and has a very focused responsibility - it implements an iterator that combines several iterables.",
        "The class has a small size with only a few methods and fields, making it easy to understand and maintain.",
        "It follows the Single Responsibility Principle by having only one reason to change - changes to how compound iteration is performed.",
        "The class properly encapsulates its internal state (current iterator and backlog queue) and exposes only the necessary iterator methods.",
        "There are no signs of excessive complexity, bloated interface, or concentrated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization.",
        "The class is well-decomposed and serves a single, specific purpose within the larger Plugin ecosystem."
