        "The class 'TypePool.ForType' is excessively large with numerous nested classes and complex hierarchies, indicating a lack of proper decomposition.",
        "It encompasses multiple responsibilities including type parsing, lazy type resolution, annotation handling, generic type token management, and bytecode extraction.",
        "The class contains deeply nested inner classes (e.g., LazyTypeDescription and its many nested classes) which increases complexity and reduces maintainability.",
        "The presence of multiple large enumerations and interface implementations within the class suggests that it handles too many concerns in a single abstraction.",
        "The class implements complex logic for handling generic signatures, annotations, and type variables which could be separated into distinct, cohesive modules."
