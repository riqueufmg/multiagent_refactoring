    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class VisitorList is of reasonable size and implements a single, well-defined abstraction: a list that overrides equals and hashCode using provided visitors. While it implements many methods due to the List interface, these are standard delegating methods that wrap around the inner list implementation. The inner class EqualsHashcodeOverridingFacade is small and serves a clear purpose. The class does not exhibit excessive complexity, bloated interface, or concentrated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
