        "The class has excessive size with numerous nested classes, enums, and complex logic encapsulated within a single file, making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "The class contains multiple responsibilities including handling different types of annotation values (constants, annotations, enumerations, types, arrays), loading mechanisms, filtering, and state management.",
        "Complexity is increased by the presence of multiple enums (RenderingDispatcher, State, Sort) and several abstract and concrete inner classes that handle specific cases like missing types, mismatched types, and loaded representations.",
        "The interface and its nested components concentrate too many responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions, violating the principle of single responsibility."
