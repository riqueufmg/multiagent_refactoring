    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class HttpHelper is a utility class with a clear, single responsibility: providing HTTP-related helper methods. It has a moderate size (approximately 1888 characters), well-defined methods, and cohesive functionality. The class handles HTTP content downloading, redirection, and connection management, all closely related tasks. It does not exhibit excessive complexity, and its interface is not bloated. The methods are appropriately sized and focused, and the class is well-organized with clear separation of concerns. Therefore, it does not qualify as insufficiently modularized."
