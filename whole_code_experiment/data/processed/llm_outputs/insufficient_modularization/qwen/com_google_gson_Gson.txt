    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Gson",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Gson class exhibits Insufficient Modularization due to its excessive size, complexity, and bloated interface. The class contains over 1600 lines of code with numerous methods handling serialization, deserialization, type adapter management, and configuration. It directly manages multiple responsibilities including JSON parsing, type conversion, adapter creation, and strictness handling. The class has 30+ fields and 50+ methods, making it difficult to understand and maintain. Many of these methods are tightly coupled and could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. The extensive use of inner classes and complex initialization logic in the constructor further indicates that the class has not been adequately decomposed into smaller, focused modules."
