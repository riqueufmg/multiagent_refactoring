    "justification": [
        "The class 'TypePool.TokenizedGenericType' is excessively large with numerous nested classes and complex generic type handling logic, indicating a lack of adequate decomposition.",
        "It encompasses multiple responsibilities including generic type resolution, lazy type loading, annotation handling, and type variable management, which could be separated into more cohesive abstractions.",
        "The class contains deeply nested inner classes such as 'LazyParameterizedType', 'LazyTypeVariable', and various 'For...' implementations, contributing to its bloated interface and complexity.",
        "The extensive use of generic type tokens and their resolution mechanisms suggests that the class is trying to manage too much functionality related to type parsing and representation, rather than delegating to smaller, specialized components."
