    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "FileFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FileFactory is well-focused on its responsibility of creating and copying files. It has a clear abstraction with a cohesive set of methods related to file creation and management. The class is not excessively large or complex, and its interface is not bloated. Inner classes like DirectorySupplier, RegularFileSupplier, and SymbolicLinkSupplier are used to encapsulate specific creation logic, contributing to better organization rather than indicating insufficient modularization."
