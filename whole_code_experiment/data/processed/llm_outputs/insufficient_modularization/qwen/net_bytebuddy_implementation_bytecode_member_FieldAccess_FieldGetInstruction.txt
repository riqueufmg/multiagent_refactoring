    "class": "FieldAccess",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FieldAccess is an enum with a well-defined purpose of representing field access operations (static and instance). It contains a reasonable number of nested classes (OfGenericField, AccessDispatcher, AbstractFieldInstruction, FieldGetInstruction, FieldPutInstruction) that are all closely related to field access functionality. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. Each nested class has a clear responsibility: AccessDispatcher handles dispatching access operations, OfGenericField deals with generic type handling, and the instruction classes manage bytecode generation. The cohesion is high and responsibilities are appropriately separated."
