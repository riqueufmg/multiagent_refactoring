    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class GeneralAppIdDecoder is focused on a single responsibility: decoding application identifiers from a bit array. It contains well-defined private methods that handle specific aspects of the decoding process (e.g., numeric, alphanumeric, ISO/IEC 646 decoding). The class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity, and its interface is not bloated. The methods are cohesive and serve the central purpose of the class, indicating sufficient modularization."
