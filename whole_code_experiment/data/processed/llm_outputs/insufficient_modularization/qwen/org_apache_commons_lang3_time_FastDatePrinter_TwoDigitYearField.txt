    "justification": "The class FastDatePrinter.TwoDigitYearField is a well-defined, cohesive inner class with a single responsibility: formatting a two-digit year. It implements the NumberRule interface and contains only the necessary methods (appendTo, estimateLength) to fulfill its purpose. The class is small, focused, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. It properly encapsulates its behavior and does not concentrate responsibilities that should be separated."
