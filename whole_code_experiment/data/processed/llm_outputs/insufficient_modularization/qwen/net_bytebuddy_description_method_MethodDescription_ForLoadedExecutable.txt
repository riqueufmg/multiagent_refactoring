        "The class MethodDescription.ForLoadedExecutable is an abstract static class that serves a specific and well-defined purpose: to provide a base implementation for loaded executable representations (methods and constructors).",
        "It contains a reasonable number of methods (less than 20 public/protected methods) that are all closely related to handling loaded executables, such as getting declaring types, return types, parameters, exception types, and various method properties.",
        "The class follows the Single Responsibility Principle by focusing solely on representing loaded executables and providing access to their metadata.",
        "While the class does have some complexity due to the nature of reflection handling, the methods are cohesive and serve the same abstraction - representing loaded executable elements.",
        "The class properly delegates specific concerns to subclasses (ForLoadedMethod and ForLoadedConstructor) which handle method-specific and constructor-specific logic respectively.",
        "The code is well-organized with clear method names and appropriate use of inheritance and abstraction to avoid code duplication while maintaining clear responsibilities."
