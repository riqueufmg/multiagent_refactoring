    "class": "BitMatrixParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BitMatrixParser is well-focused on parsing QR code bit matrices and has a clear set of responsibilities: reading format information, reading version information, reading codewords, and handling mirroring and masking operations. The methods are cohesive and directly related to QR code parsing. The class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity, and its interface is not bloated. Therefore, it does not represent an insufficiently modularized abstraction."
