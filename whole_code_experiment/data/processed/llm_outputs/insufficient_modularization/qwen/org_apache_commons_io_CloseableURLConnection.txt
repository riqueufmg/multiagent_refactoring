    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CloseableURLConnection is a well-defined, cohesive abstraction that wraps a URLConnection to provide AutoCloseable functionality. It has a single responsibility: delegating all URLConnection methods to the wrapped instance and implementing the close() method. The class is small (approximately 150 lines), has a clear purpose, and does not expose a bloated interface. All methods are simple delegations or directly related to the core responsibility of the class. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or inadequate decomposition."
