    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BasicAttributeProvider.View is a private static nested class with a single responsibility: implementing the BasicFileAttributeView interface. It contains only methods directly related to its purpose (name, readAttributes, setTimes), has a clear constructor, and encapsulates behavior specific to attribute view operations. The class is small, cohesive, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. It properly delegates file operations to the File object and handles only the concerns of a file attribute view implementation."
