    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TypeWriter.WithDrain is an interface that defines a single method 'make' and a nested interface 'Record'. This is a very focused responsibility and does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization such as excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface. The class has a clear and concise purpose within the Byte Buddy library's type writing functionality."
