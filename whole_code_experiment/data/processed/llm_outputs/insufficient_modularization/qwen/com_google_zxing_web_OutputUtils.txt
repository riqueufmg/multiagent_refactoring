    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class OutputUtils is a utility class with only two methods (arrayToString and hexChar) and two private static fields. The class has a single responsibility of converting byte arrays to hex string representation, which is well encapsulated. The size and complexity are minimal, and the interface is not bloated. The class is properly cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
