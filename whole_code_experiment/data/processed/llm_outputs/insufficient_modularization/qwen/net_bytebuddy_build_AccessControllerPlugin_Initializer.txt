    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AccessControllerPlugin.Initializer' is abstract and serves a single, well-defined purpose: to initialize a field based on the availability of java.security.AccessController. It has a clear hierarchy with two inner static classes (WithProperty and WithoutProperty) that handle specific variations of the initialization logic. The class is cohesive, with all methods and fields directly related to its core responsibility. It does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. The abstraction is appropriately decomposed, and responsibilities are well-separated between the base class and its subclasses."
