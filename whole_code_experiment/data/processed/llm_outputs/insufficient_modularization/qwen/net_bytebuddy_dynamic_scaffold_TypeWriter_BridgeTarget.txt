    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TypeWriter.BridgeTarget is a nested class within the large TypeWriter interface, but it is not excessively large or complex by itself. It serves a specific purpose of representing a bridge's target method in its defined shape, encapsulating the necessary logic for this specific functionality. While the outer TypeWriter interface is very large and complex (exhibiting Insufficient Modularization), the BridgeTarget class itself is reasonably sized and focused, thus does not exhibit the smell of Insufficient Modularization."
