        "It has a bloated interface with 30+ public static nested classes, each implementing different CSS selector evaluation strategies.",
        "The class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by encompassing multiple responsibilities such as tag matching, attribute matching, pseudo-class evaluation, text matching, and more.",
        "Several nested classes like CssNthEvaluator and its subclasses (IsNthChild, IsNthLastChild, IsNthOfType, IsNthLastOfType) could be moved to their own files to improve cohesion and maintainability.",
        "The class contains deprecated elements (e.g., MatchText) which indicates evolving responsibilities over time without proper decomposition."
