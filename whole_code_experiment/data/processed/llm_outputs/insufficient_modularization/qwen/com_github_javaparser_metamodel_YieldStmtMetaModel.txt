    "justification": "The class YieldStmtMetaModel is a small, focused class with minimal responsibilities. It extends StatementMetaModel and only contains a constructor and one field, indicating proper decomposition and adherence to single responsibility principle. The class is also auto-generated, which implies it follows a predefined structural pattern rather than manual design flaws."
