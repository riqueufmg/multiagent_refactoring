        "The class 'DynamicType.Unloaded' is an interface with 14 methods, which indicates a high level of responsibility and complexity.",
        "It defines multiple methods related to saving, injecting, and manipulating dynamic types, suggesting that it handles various aspects of dynamic type management.",
        "The class also includes nested interfaces and classes such as 'Builder', 'ModuleDefinition', 'InnerTypeDefinition', etc., which further increases its complexity and size.",
        "Given the number of methods and nested types, the class represents an abstraction that has not been adequately decomposed, leading to excessive size and complexity, which are characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
