        "The class has a large number of methods (more than 30 public methods), indicating high complexity and multiple responsibilities.",
        "It directly manages multiple concerns such as field resolution, method resolution, type solving, and ancestor traversal, which could be separated into distinct modules or helper classes.",
        "The class has deep dependencies on various other classes (e.g., JavaParserTypeAdapter, SymbolSolver, AstResolutionUtils), suggesting it orchestrates too many functionalities itself rather than delegating appropriately.",
        "Several methods are large and contain nested logic, especially around type resolution and ancestor computation, increasing cognitive load and maintenance difficulty.",
        "Use of anonymous inner classes (e.g., in getAllFields) increases complexity and suggests potential for extraction into separate classes or named implementations."
