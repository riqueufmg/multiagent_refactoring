    "justification": "The TypeList interface and its nested classes are well-factored into multiple cohesive abstractions. Each class has a clear, single responsibility: TypeList.Empty handles empty lists, ForLoadedTypes handles loaded types, Explicit wraps explicit type descriptions, and Generic handles generic type lists with further specializations. The interface and its implementations maintain good separation of concerns, with appropriate delegation and inheritance hierarchies. The complexity is managed through proper decomposition rather than concentrated in large, unwieldy classes."
