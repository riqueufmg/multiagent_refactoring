    "class": "Node.DirectChildrenIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Node.DirectChildrenIterator is a nested static class with a very focused responsibility - it simply iterates over the direct children of a node. It has only one field (childrenIterator) and implements a standard Iterator interface with hasNext() and next() methods. The class is small, cohesive, and well-encapsulated, representing a single, well-defined abstraction. It does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
