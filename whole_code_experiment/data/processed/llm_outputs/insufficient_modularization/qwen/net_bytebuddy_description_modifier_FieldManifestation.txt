    "justification": "The class is a well-designed enum with a clear and limited responsibility of representing field manifestations (PLAIN, FINAL, VOLATILE). It contains only essential methods directly related to its purpose: getting mask values, checking field properties (final, volatile, plain), and implementing the ModifierContributor interface. The class is small, cohesive, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. All methods are focused on the core abstraction of field manifestation states."
