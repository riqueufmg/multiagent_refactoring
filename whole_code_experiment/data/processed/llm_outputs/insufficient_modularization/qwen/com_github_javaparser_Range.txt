        "The class is relatively small, with only 22 methods and 2 fields, which is manageable.",
        "All methods are cohesive and related to the core abstraction of a character range (e.g., creation, comparison, containment checks, and string representation).",
        "There are no signs of bloated interface or excessive complexity in the method signatures or implementations.",
        "The class does not expose an overly complex public API; it provides essential operations for range manipulation and querying.",
        "While there are several 'with*' methods for creating modified copies, these are consistent with the immutable value object pattern and do not indicate poor modularization."
