    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ByteBufferCleaner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ByteBufferCleaner is well-focused on a single responsibility: cleaning direct ByteBuffers across different JVM versions. It has a clear abstraction with appropriate decomposition into inner classes (Java8Cleaner, Java9Cleaner) that handle version-specific cleaning mechanisms. The class is relatively small (approximately 100 lines), has a cohesive interface with only two public methods (clean, isSupported), and effectively encapsulates the complexity of JVM-specific reflection code. The design follows the strategy pattern through the Cleaner interface, demonstrating good modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
