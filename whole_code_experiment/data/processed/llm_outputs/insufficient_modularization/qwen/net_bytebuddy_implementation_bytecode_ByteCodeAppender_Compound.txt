    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ByteCodeAppender.Compound is well-focused, implementing a single responsibility of combining multiple byte code appenders. Its size is reasonable with only essential fields and methods. The complexity is low as it primarily delegates operations to its contained appenders. The interface is minimal and cohesive, exposing only necessary functionality for its purpose."
