    "justification": [
        "The class FieldAccessor is excessively large with numerous nested classes and interfaces, leading to high complexity and making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "It contains multiple levels of nested classes (e.g., ForImplicitProperty, ForSetter and its nested classes like OfParameterValue, OfDefaultValue, etc.) which increases the overall size and cognitive load.",
        "The class handles multiple responsibilities including field access logic, different types of field setters, field location resolution, and bytecode manipulation, indicating a lack of proper decomposition.",
        "The presence of many inner interfaces (PropertyConfigurable, AssignerConfigurable, OwnerTypeLocatable) and their implementations within the same class file suggests that the abstraction has not been adequately decomposed into smaller, more cohesive units."
