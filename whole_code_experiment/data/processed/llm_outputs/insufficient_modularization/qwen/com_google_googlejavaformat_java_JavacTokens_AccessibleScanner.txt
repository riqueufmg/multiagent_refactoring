    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JavacTokens is well-structured and maintains a single responsibility of lexing Java source code and handling tokens. It contains nested static classes (RawTok, CommentSavingTokenizer, CommentWithTextAndPosition, AccessibleScanner) that are closely related to its core functionality and contribute to a cohesive design. The class has a moderate size (~150 lines), clear purpose as indicated by its documentation ('A wrapper around javac's lexer'), and does not exhibit excessive complexity or a bloated interface. Each nested class has a distinct role supporting the main functionality without unnecessary entanglement, indicating sufficient modularization."
