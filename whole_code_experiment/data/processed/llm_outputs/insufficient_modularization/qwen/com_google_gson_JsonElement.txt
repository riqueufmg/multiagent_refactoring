    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "JsonElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The JsonElement class is an abstract class that defines a clear abstraction for JSON elements. It provides a cohesive set of methods for type checking (isJsonArray, isJsonObject, etc.) and type conversion (getAsJsonObject, getAsJsonArray, etc.). The class has a single responsibility of representing JSON elements and providing access to their values. The size and complexity are appropriate for its role as a base class in the JSON type hierarchy. The class does not contain excessive functionality or unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
