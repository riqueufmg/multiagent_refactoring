        "The class has a large number of methods (more than 30), indicating high complexity and multiple responsibilities.",
        "Several methods are excessively long and complex, such as 'deriveImpliedBounds' which spans over 300 lines and handles multiple responsibilities including constraint formula processing, bound incorporation, and type inference logic.",
        "The class contains nested loops and deeply nested conditionals, particularly in methods like 'deriveImpliedBounds' and 'performResolution', increasing cognitive complexity.",
        "The class mixes low-level type manipulation, constraint handling, and resolution logic, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive classes.",
        "Helper methods like 'forEachPairSameAs', 'forEachPairSameAndSubtype', and 'forEachPairSubtypeAndSubtype' suggest that the class is doing too much iteration and comparison logic that could be modularized.",
        "The presence of multiple TODOs and UnsupportedOperationExceptions indicates incomplete decomposition and unimplemented responsibilities that should be separated."
