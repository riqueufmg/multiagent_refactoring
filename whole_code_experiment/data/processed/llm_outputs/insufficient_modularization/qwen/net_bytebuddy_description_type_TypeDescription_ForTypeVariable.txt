    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TypeDescription.ForTypeVariable is a nested interface within TypeDescription and represents a specific abstraction for type variables. It is well-focused on its responsibility of describing type variables and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. The class maintains a cohesive set of methods and properties directly related to type variable descriptions, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle. There is no indication of inadequate decomposition or concentration of unrelated responsibilities that would suggest insufficient modularization."
