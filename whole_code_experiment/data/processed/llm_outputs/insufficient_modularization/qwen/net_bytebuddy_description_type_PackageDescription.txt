    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class PackageDescription is an interface that defines a clear abstraction for representing Java packages. It has a cohesive set of responsibilities including package naming, containment checks, and annotation handling. The class is reasonably sized with well-defined methods and nested classes (AbstractBase, Simple, ForLoadedPackage) that each have single responsibilities. The interface and its implementations follow the single responsibility principle, with each component having a distinct role in package representation and manipulation. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
