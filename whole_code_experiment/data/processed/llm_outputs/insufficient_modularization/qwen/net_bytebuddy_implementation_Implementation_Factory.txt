        "The class 'Implementation' is a large interface with multiple nested interfaces, enums, and classes, resulting in high complexity and size.",
        "It contains several nested types such as 'Composable', 'SpecialMethodInvocation', 'Target', 'Context', and 'Compound', each with their own nested classes and interfaces, leading to a bloated structure.",
        "The class represents multiple abstractions including method invocation handling, implementation targeting, context management, and compound implementations, which are not adequately separated into distinct, cohesive modules.",
        "The extensive nesting and large number of inner classes and interfaces indicate that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed, making it difficult to understand and maintain."
