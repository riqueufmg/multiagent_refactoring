    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single responsibility of managing configuration for ByteBuddy Android tasks. It contains 11 fields related to configuration properties and provides corresponding getters/setters. The class follows standard patterns for Gradle task extensions with configuration methods and a configure method to apply settings to a task. While it has multiple methods, they are all cohesive and related to the single responsibility of configuration management. The class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant decomposition."
