        "The class 'MemberSubstitution' is extremely large with a size of 73356 bytes, indicating high complexity and likely violation of the single responsibility principle.",
        "The class contains numerous nested classes (e.g., WithoutSpecification and its nested classes, TypePoolResolver and its implementations, Target and its implementations, Substitution and its numerous nested classes, Replacement and its nested classes, etc.) that suggest it is handling multiple responsibilities.",
        "The class handles various concerns including member substitution logic, type pool resolution, target representation, substitution strategies, replacement mechanisms, method visitor implementation, and annotation definitions, which should ideally be separated into distinct modules.",
        "The presence of deeply nested generic types and complex method signatures indicates high cognitive complexity and lack of clear abstraction boundaries.",
        "The class includes multiple factory interfaces and complex delegation mechanisms (e.g., ForDelegation with extensive offset mapping configurations) that increase its internal complexity and make it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "The extensive use of inner classes for different substitution strategies (ForFieldAccess, ForMethodInvocation, Chain, etc.) indicates that the class is trying to encapsulate too many variations of behavior rather than delegating to separate, focused classes."
