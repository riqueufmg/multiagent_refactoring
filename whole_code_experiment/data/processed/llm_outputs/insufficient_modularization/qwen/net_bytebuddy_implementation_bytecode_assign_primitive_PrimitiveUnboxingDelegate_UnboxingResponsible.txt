    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate is well-decomposed and adheres to the single responsibility principle. It encapsulates the logic for unboxing primitive types through an enum structure, with clear separation of concerns. The class includes nested enums (ExplicitlyTypedUnboxingResponsible) and a static class (ImplicitlyTypedUnboxingResponsible) that handle specific unboxing responsibilities, promoting modularity. The interface UnboxingResponsible defines a clear contract for unboxing behavior. The class is not excessively large or complex, and its methods are focused on specific tasks related to unboxing primitives. Therefore, it does not exhibit the smell of Insufficient Modularization."
