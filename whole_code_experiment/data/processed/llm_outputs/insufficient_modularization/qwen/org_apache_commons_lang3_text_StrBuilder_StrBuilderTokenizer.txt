        "The StrBuilder class has excessive size with over 2400 lines of code, making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "It concentrates multiple responsibilities including string building, tokenization, reading, and writing operations that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.",
        "The class contains multiple inner classes (StrBuilderReader, StrBuilderTokenizer, StrBuilderWriter) that add to its complexity and size.",
        "It has a bloated interface with numerous public methods covering appending, deleting, replacing, searching, and various utility operations.",
        "The class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by handling too many different concerns in one class rather than delegating to specialized components."
