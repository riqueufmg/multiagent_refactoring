    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a simple enum with only 4 constants (SUGGESTION, ELIMINATED_ALLOCATION, ELIDED_LOCK, INLINING). It represents a straightforward enumeration of report stage types without any complex logic, methods, or excessive responsibilities. The class is appropriately sized and focused on a single abstraction - defining different types of report stages. There is no evidence of bloated interface, excessive complexity, or concentrated responsibilities that would require decomposition."
