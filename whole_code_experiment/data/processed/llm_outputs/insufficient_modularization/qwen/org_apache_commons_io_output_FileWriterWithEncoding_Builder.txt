    "class": "FileWriterWithEncoding.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of building a FileWriterWithEncoding instance. It encapsulates the construction logic related to file writing with encoding, including setting append mode and managing charset encoders. The class is relatively small, with only a few methods and attributes, all closely related to its purpose. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
