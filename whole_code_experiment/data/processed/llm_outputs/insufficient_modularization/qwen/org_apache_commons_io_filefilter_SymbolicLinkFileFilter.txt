    "class": "SymbolicLinkFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of filtering symbolic link files. It is small in size, with only a few methods, and maintains a clear and cohesive interface. The class properly delegates the symbolic link checking to the standard library method Files.isSymbolicLink(), and provides implementations for both classic IO and NIO file filtering mechanisms. There is no evidence of excessive complexity, bloated interface, or concentrated responsibilities that would warrant decomposition into smaller abstractions."
