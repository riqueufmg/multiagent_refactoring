    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The TypeInitializer interface is well-designed with clear separation of concerns. It defines a focused abstraction for type initialization with only essential methods (isDefined, expandWith, wrap, apply). The interface contains three well-encapsulated inner types (Drain, None, Simple) that each have single responsibilities. None represents the undefined state, Simple handles defined initializers, and Drain manages the writing process. Each inner class has a clear purpose with minimal complexity. The interface has a cohesive set of responsibilities related to type initialization and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or bloated interfaces. The design follows good modularization principles with proper encapsulation and separation of concerns."
