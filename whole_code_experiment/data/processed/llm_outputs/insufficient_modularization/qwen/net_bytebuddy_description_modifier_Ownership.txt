    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Ownership",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Ownership is a well-decomposed enum with only two instances (MEMBER and STATIC) and a minimal set of cohesive methods. It has a single responsibility of representing ownership modifiers for fields, methods, and types. The class is small in size, has low complexity, and does not expose a bloated interface. All methods are directly related to the core abstraction of ownership representation, and there are no signs of inadequate decomposition or concentrated responsibilities that would warrant further modularization."
