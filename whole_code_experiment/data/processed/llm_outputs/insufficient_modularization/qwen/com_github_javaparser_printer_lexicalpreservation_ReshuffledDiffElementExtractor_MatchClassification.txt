    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor, while containing complex logic for handling reshuffled elements and their correspondence mapping, remains within reasonable size and complexity boundaries. It encapsulates a single cohesive responsibility of extracting and processing reshuffled difference elements. The methods are meaningfully organized, and the inner enum MatchClassification supports the class's functionality without indicating bloating. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would suggest the need for further decomposition."
