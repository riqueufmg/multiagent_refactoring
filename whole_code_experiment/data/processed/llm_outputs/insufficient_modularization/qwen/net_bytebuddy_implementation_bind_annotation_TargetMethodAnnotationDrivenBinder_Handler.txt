        "Each inner class has a distinct responsibility: Record handles binding records, DelegationProcessor manages parameter binding logic, Handler processes individual parameter bindings, and ParameterBinder defines the binding interface.",

        "The class size (5612 characters) is reasonable for its functionality and complexity, and the code is well-organized with clear separation of concerns."
