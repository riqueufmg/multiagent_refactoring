    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class NamingStrategy is an interface that defines a clear abstraction for naming strategies. It includes several well-defined nested classes (Suffixing, SuffixingRandom, PrefixingRandom) and an abstract base class (AbstractBase), each with distinct responsibilities. The structure demonstrates good decomposition with separate classes handling different naming logic (suffixing, random suffixing, prefixing). The interface and its nested classes maintain clear separation of concerns, appropriate cohesion, and reasonable size for their respective responsibilities. The class properly delegates specific naming behaviors to specialized implementations rather than concentrating too many responsibilities in a single class."
