    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class SimpleToken is small and focused, with only two fields (value and bitCount) and three methods (constructor, appendTo, and toString). It has a single responsibility of representing a simple token in the Aztec encoder and properly encapsulates its behavior. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
