    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "EventListenerSupport",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of managing event listeners and firing events. It is of moderate size (~300 lines) and has a cohesive interface focused on listener management (addListener, removeListener, fire). While it contains an inner class ProxyInvocationHandler, this is a closely related component that handles the proxy invocation logic, which is integral to its core functionality. The class does not exhibit excessive complexity, bloated interface, or multiple unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
