    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "JavaParserEnumDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JavaParserEnumDeclaration is of moderate size and encapsulates a single, well-defined abstraction for representing enum declarations in JavaParser. It implements necessary interfaces and delegates responsibilities appropriately, such as using JavaParserTypeAdapter for common type declaration logic. While it contains nested classes (ValuesMethod and ValueOfMethod), these are tightly related to the enum declaration concept and contribute to its completeness rather than indicating insufficient decomposition. The class maintains clear separation of concerns and does not exhibit excessive complexity or a bloated interface that would suggest inadequate modularization."
