    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Type class, while abstract and serving as a base for various type representations, maintains a reasonable size and clear purpose. It provides common functionality for all types such as handling annotations, and includes type-checking and conversion methods. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. Instead, it appropriately encapsulates shared behavior for its subclasses, promoting code reuse and maintaining a cohesive abstraction for type-related operations in the JavaParser AST. The numerous generated methods for type checking and conversion are necessary for the class's role as a base type in a complex type hierarchy and do not indicate insufficient modularization."
