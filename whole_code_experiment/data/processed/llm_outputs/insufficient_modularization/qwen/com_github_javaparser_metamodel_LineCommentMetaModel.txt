    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class LineCommentMetaModel is a small, focused class with a single constructor and no additional methods or fields. It extends CommentMetaModel and is generated automatically by a meta-model generator, indicating it is designed to be a simple data holder for meta-model information. Its size and complexity are minimal, and it does not concentrate multiple responsibilities, thus it does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
