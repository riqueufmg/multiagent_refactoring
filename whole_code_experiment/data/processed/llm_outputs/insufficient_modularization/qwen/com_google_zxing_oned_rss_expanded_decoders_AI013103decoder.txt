    "justification": "The class AI013103decoder is a small, focused class with only two overridden methods and a constructor. It extends AI013x0xDecoder and implements specific behavior for adding weight codes and checking weight values. The class has a single responsibility, is not excessively large, and does not exhibit complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
