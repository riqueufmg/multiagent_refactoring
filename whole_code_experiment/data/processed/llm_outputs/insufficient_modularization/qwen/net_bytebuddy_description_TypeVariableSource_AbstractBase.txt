    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TypeVariableSource.AbstractBase is a small, well-defined abstract base implementation with only three methods (findVariable, findExpectedVariable, and toSafeString). It properly delegates responsibilities and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. The class focuses on a single responsibility of providing basic functionality for type variable sources, making it sufficiently modularized."
