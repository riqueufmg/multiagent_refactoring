    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a clear single responsibility as a specialized container for ParseErrors with size limitations. It has appropriate cohesion with only 9 methods and 3 fields, all directly related to its purpose. The class is small in size (557 bytes) and has a focused interface with well-defined behaviors for error tracking and management. There is no evidence of excessive complexity, bloated interface, or concentrated responsibilities that would warrant decomposition into smaller abstractions."
