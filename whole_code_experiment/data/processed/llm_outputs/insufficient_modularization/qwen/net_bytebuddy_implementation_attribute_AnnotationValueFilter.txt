    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class AnnotationValueFilter is appropriately modularized. It defines a clear interface with a single responsibility: determining which annotation values should be written to a class file. The interface is concise, with only one core method (isRelevant) and a nested Factory interface that logically groups factory methods for different target types. The Default enum implementation provides two simple, well-defined strategies without unnecessary complexity. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface, and responsibilities are appropriately separated into cohesive abstractions."
