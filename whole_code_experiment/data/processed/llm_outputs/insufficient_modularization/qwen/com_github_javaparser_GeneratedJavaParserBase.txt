        "Multiple responsibilities are observed such as token management, error recovery, node list operations, lambda expression generation, and array type handling.",
        "Several methods deal with low-level parsing details and token manipulations that could be separated into dedicated classes or modules.",
        "The class serves as a base for generated parser code but accumulates numerous utility and helper methods that violate the single responsibility principle.",
        "Complexity is increased by conditional logic based on 'storeTokens' flag scattered across multiple methods, suggesting a lack of cohesive design."
