    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class HandleInvocation is small and focused, containing only a constructor and a single method (apply) that performs a specific task related to method handle invocation. It has a clear responsibility of representing an exact invocation of a method handle with a polymorphic signature, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
