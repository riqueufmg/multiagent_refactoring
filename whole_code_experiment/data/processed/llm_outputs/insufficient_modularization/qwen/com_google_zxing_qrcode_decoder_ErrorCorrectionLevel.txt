    "justification": "The class is a well-defined enum with only four constants and minimal functionality. It has a clear single responsibility of representing QR code error correction levels and providing a mapping between bits and error correction levels. The class is small, cohesive, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface."
