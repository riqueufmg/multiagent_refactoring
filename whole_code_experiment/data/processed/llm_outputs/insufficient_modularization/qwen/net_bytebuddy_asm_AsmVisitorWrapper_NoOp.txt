        "It contains several nested classes (NoOp, AbstractBase, ForDeclaredFields, ForDeclaredMethods, Compound) that are logically related and contribute to the overall functionality of ASM visitor wrapping.",
        "Each nested class has a distinct responsibility: NoOp provides a no-operation implementation, AbstractBase offers a base implementation, ForDeclaredFields handles field visitor wrapping, ForDeclaredMethods manages method visitor wrapping, and Compound allows chaining of wrappers.",
        "The class structure follows the Interface Segregation Principle and Single Responsibility Principle, with each component having a clear and specific role.",
        "The size and complexity of the class are justified by the comprehensive functionality it provides for ASM visitor wrapping, and the nested classes are appropriately cohesive and decoupled.",
        "There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
