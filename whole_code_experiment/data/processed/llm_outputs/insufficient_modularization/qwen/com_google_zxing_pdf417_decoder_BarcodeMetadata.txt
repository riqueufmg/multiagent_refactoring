    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BarcodeMetadata is a simple data class with only five private final fields and corresponding getter methods. It has a single constructor that initializes all fields and computes one derived value (rowCount). The class has a clear single responsibility of holding barcode metadata information, with no complex logic or multiple responsibilities. The size and complexity are minimal, making it well-modularized."
