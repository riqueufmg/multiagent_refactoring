        "The class encompasses multiple responsibilities including field handling, method handling, record component handling, type validation, class file creation, inlining, and decoration.",
        "Nested classes like ValidatingClassVisitor, ForInlining, ForCreation contain extensive logic with multiple inner classes, indicating a lack of proper decomposition.",
        "The interface contains deeply nested hierarchies with multiple levels of inner classes (e.g., MethodPool.Record implementations with several nested classes).",
        "The class handles various distinct concerns such as ASM visitor wrapping, type initialization, class file dumping, and different type writing strategies (creation, redefinition, rebasing, decoration) all within one structure."
