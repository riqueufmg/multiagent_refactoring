    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CountingPathVisitor is well-factored into multiple cohesive units. It separates concerns by using an AbstractBuilder and a concrete Builder inner class, encapsulating construction logic. The class itself focuses on visiting paths and counting files/directories, with clear delegation of filtering and transformation responsibilities. The presence of a builder pattern, clear method separation, and manageable size indicate sufficient modularization."
