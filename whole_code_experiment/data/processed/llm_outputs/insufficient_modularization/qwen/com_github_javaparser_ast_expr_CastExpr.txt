    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CastExpr is a well-defined, cohesive class representing a typecast expression in JavaParser. It has a clear responsibility of modeling a cast expression with a type and an expression. The class is relatively small, with only essential fields (type and expression), and implements necessary interfaces and methods for its purpose. It does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. The class leverages appropriate abstractions and follows standard patterns for node representation in an AST, including visitor pattern acceptance, cloning, and property management. Therefore, it does not represent Insufficient Modularization."
