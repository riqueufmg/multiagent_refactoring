        "The class MethodRebaseResolver.Default is focused on a single responsibility: resolving method rebasing for instrumentation.",
        "It contains a reasonable amount of logic (less than 4016 characters as per context size) with clear methods such as make, resolve, getAuxiliaryTypes, and asTokenMap.",
        "The class collaborates with well-defined types (e.g., MethodDescription, Resolution, DynamicType) without embedding multiple unrelated concerns.",
        "Complexity is managed through delegation to specialized inner classes like Resolution.ForRebasedMethod and Resolution.ForRebasedConstructor.",
        "There is no evidence of bloated interface or excessive size that would indicate inadequate decomposition."
