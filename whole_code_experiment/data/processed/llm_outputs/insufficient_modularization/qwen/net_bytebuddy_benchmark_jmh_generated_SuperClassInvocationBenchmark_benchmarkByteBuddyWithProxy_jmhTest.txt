        "The class is auto-generated by JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness), which typically produces large, monolithic classes as part of its code generation process.",
        "The class serves a single, well-defined purpose: to execute and measure benchmarks for ByteBuddy proxy invocation performance.",
        "While the class is large (~450 lines), it does not exhibit excessive complexity or a bloated interface. Its methods are repetitive but follow a consistent pattern required for benchmark execution across different measurement modes (Throughput, AverageTime, SampleTime, SingleShotTime).",
        "There is no evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities being handled within the class; all logic pertains directly to setting up, running, and reporting on specific benchmark scenarios.",
        "Given that this is machine-generated code with a narrow focus, standard modularization principles do not necessarily apply."
