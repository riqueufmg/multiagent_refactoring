    "justification": "The class ClassByExtensionBenchmark is a JMH benchmark class that follows a well-defined structure for performance testing. While it contains multiple benchmark methods and setup logic, these are all cohesive and related to the single responsibility of benchmarking different approaches to class extension. The class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity beyond what is reasonable for its purpose. The inner classes (ByteBuddyProxyInterceptor, ByteBuddyAccessInterceptor, ByteBuddyPrefixInterceptor) are simple, focused interceptors that serve specific benchmark scenarios. The class maintains good organization with clear separation of concerns between setup, baseline, and various benchmark methods, each following a consistent pattern. The interface is not bloated as each method serves a distinct benchmarking purpose within the same domain."
