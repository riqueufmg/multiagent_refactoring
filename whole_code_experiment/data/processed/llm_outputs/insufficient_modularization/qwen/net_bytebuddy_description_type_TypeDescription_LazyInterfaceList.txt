    "class": "TypeDescription.LazyInterfaceList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TypeDescription.LazyInterfaceList is a nested static class with a very focused responsibility - it represents a lazy projection of a type's interfaces. It has a clear single purpose, with only essential fields (delegate and rawInterfaces) and methods (get, size) needed for its function. The class is small in size and complexity, properly encapsulated within the larger TypeDescription hierarchy, and does not expose a bloated interface. It follows the single responsibility principle and maintains appropriate cohesion, making it a well-modularized component rather than exhibiting insufficient modularization."
