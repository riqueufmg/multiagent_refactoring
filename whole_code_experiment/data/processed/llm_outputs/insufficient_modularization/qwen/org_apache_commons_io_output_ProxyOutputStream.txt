    "class": "ProxyOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ProxyOutputStream is well-designed with a single responsibility of acting as a proxy for OutputStream. It has a reasonable number of methods (approximately 15 public/protected methods), which is within acceptable limits for this type of utility class. The class follows the template method pattern effectively by providing protected methods like beforeWrite, afterWrite, and handleIOException that allow subclasses to customize behavior without overriding all write methods. The inclusion of a Builder subclass is appropriate and doesn't contribute to bloating since it serves a specific construction purpose. The class maintains good cohesion around its core responsibility of proxying OutputStream operations while providing extension points, and its complexity remains manageable."
