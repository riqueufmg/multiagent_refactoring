        "The class concentrates multiple responsibilities including handling different annotation value types (constants, annotations, enumerations, types, arrays), loading logic, filtering, and rendering",
        "The class contains multiple large nested enums (RenderingDispatcher with 5 variants, State, Sort) and numerous inner classes (ForConstant, ForAnnotationDescription, ForEnumerationDescription, ForTypeDescription, ForDescriptionArray, etc.) that could be separated into their own cohesive units",
        "Complex conditional logic is spread throughout the class for handling different value types and states rather than being decomposed into specialized components",
        "The single class handles both the unloaded and loaded representations of annotation values along with their various edge cases and error conditions"
