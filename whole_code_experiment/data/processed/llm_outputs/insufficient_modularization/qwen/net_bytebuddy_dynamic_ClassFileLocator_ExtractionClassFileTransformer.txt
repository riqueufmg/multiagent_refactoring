        "The ClassFileLocator interface is well-designed with a single responsibility of locating class files.",
        "It contains several nested classes and interfaces, but each serves a distinct purpose and is appropriately cohesive.",
        "The nested classes (Simple, ForClassLoader, ForJarFile, etc.) are logically grouped under the ClassFileLocator interface, following a factory pattern.",
        "Each nested class has a clear, single responsibility (e.g., ForClassLoader handles class loader-based lookups, ForJarFile handles JAR file lookups).",
        "The interface and its implementations follow good object-oriented design principles with proper encapsulation.",
        "While the interface contains many nested classes, they represent different strategies for class file location rather than unrelated responsibilities.",
        "The code exhibits high cohesion within each nested class and proper separation of concerns across different implementations.",
        "The size and complexity are justified by the comprehensive nature of supporting multiple class file location strategies."
