    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ImmutablePair",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ImmutablePair is well-scoped to represent an immutable pair of objects. It has a clear and focused responsibility of providing an immutable implementation of a pair. The class is not excessively large, does not contain overly complex logic, and its interface is minimal and cohesive. All methods and fields are directly related to the core abstraction of an immutable pair. The presence of multiple static factory methods (e.g., of, ofNonNull, left, right, nullPair, emptyArray) supports usability without bloating the class's responsibilities. Therefore, it does not exhibit the smell of Insufficient Modularization."
