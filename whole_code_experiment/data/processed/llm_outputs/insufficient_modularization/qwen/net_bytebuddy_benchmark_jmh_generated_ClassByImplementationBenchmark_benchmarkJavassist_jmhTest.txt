    "justification": [
        "The class is auto-generated by JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness), which typically produces large, monolithic classes as part of its benchmarking infrastructure.",
        "The class contains multiple benchmark methods (e.g., benchmarkJavassist_Throughput, benchmarkJavassist_AverageTime, etc.) and their corresponding stubs, which is expected behavior for JMH-generated test classes.",
        "Despite its size, the class follows a consistent structural pattern where each benchmark mode (Throughput, AverageTime, SampleTime, SingleShotTime) has dedicated methods with similar logic, indicating intentional design rather than poor modularization.",
        "There is no evidence of unrelated responsibilities being mixed within the class; all methods are related to executing and measuring benchmarks.",
        "The presence of numerous padding fields (p000 to p255) and boilerplate code is characteristic of JMH's approach to prevent false sharing and ensure accurate benchmarking, not a sign of insufficient modularization."
