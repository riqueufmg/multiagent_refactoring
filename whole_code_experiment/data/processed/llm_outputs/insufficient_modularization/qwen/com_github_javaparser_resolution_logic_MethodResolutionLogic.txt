        "The class has excessive size with many methods (more than 50), indicating high complexity.",
        "Multiple responsibilities are mixed within the class, including method applicability checking, type inference, lambda conflict resolution, and method specificity determination.",
        "Large methods with complex logic, such as `isApplicable` and `findMostApplicable`, suggest insufficient decomposition of responsibilities.",
        "Helper methods like `substituteDeclaringTypeParameters` and `inferTypes` indicate tightly coupled logic that could be modularized into separate classes or components.",
        "Lack of clear separation of concerns makes the class difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve."
