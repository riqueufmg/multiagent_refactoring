    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class NoCache is a minimal implementation of the Cache interface with only essential methods. It has a single responsibility of providing a no-op cache implementation. The class is small, simple, and well-cohesive, containing only the necessary methods to fulfill its contract as a cache that stores nothing. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
