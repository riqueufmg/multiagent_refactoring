    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The TypeAdapterFactory interface is properly modularized. It contains only one abstract method 'create' which defines the contract for creating type adapters. The interface has a single, well-defined responsibility - to serve as a factory for TypeAdapter instances. There are no excessive responsibilities, bloated interfaces, or complex implementations within this interface itself. The extensive JavaDoc documentation and examples do not contribute to the interface's complexity or size; they provide necessary usage guidance. The interface maintains high cohesion and low complexity, adhering to proper modularization principles."
