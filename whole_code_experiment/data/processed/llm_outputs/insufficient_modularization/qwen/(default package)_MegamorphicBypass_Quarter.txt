    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of demonstrating megamorphic dispatch behavior through a simple simulation. While it contains nested classes (Nickel, Dime, Quarter) and a main execution loop, the overall complexity remains low as all components directly serve the core purpose. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would warrant decomposition into separate modules."
