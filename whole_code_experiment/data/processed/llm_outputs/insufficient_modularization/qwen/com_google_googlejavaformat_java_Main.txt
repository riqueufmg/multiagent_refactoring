    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Main, while handling multiple responsibilities such as command-line argument processing, file formatting, and output management, maintains a cohesive purpose as the entry point for the Java formatter CLI. Its size and complexity are justified by its role in coordinating the formatting process, managing input/output streams, and handling execution flow. The methods are well-organized around core functionalities (e.g., formatFiles, formatStdin, processArgs), and the class does not exhibit excessive complexity or a bloated interface that would warrant decomposition."
