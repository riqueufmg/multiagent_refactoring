    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The InnerClassContainer class and its nested classes are simple data structures with minimal functionality. Each class has a single responsibility and contains only static methods with straightforward implementations. The nesting hierarchy reflects a logical organization rather than excessive complexity. The classes are small, cohesive, and do not exhibit the size, complexity, or bloated interface characteristics that define insufficient modularization."
