        "It encapsulates a manageable set of attributes (protectionDomain, persistenceHandler, packageDefinitionStrategy, etc.) directly related to its core responsibility.",
        "Its methods are cohesive and focused on configuring and executing the class loading process based on the provided settings.",
        "Although it contains several configuration options, they are all tightly related to the wrapping dispatch mechanism and do not indicate a violation of modularity or excessive complexity.",
        "There is no evidence of the class being excessively large or implementing multiple unrelated concerns that would suggest insufficient decomposition."
