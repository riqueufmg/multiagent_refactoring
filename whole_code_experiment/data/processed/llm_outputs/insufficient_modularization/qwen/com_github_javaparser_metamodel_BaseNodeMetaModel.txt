    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BaseNodeMetaModel is well-structured and maintains a clear single responsibility of managing meta-model information for AST nodes. It has a cohesive set of fields and methods that are closely related to representing and operating on meta-model data. The class is of moderate size (approximately 200 lines), and its methods are focused, with no excessively long or complex methods. There is no evidence of excessive complexity, bloated interface, or concentration of unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
