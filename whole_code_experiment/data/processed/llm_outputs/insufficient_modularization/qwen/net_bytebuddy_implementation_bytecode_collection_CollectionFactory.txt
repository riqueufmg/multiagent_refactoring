    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The CollectionFactory interface is properly modularized with only two well-defined methods (getComponentType and withValues) that represent a single, cohesive abstraction for creating collections. The interface has a clear and focused responsibility, with no excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface. The implementation is concise and maintains high cohesion while representing a single abstraction for collection creation."
