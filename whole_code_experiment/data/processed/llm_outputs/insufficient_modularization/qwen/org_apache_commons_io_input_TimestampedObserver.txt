    "class": "TimestampedObserver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TimestampedObserver is small and focused, containing only essential fields and methods related to timestamping functionality. It has a clear single responsibility of tracking open and close times and calculating durations. The class has only 9 methods and 2 fields, which is not excessive. The interface is simple and not bloated. There are no complex conditional logic or intertwined responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
