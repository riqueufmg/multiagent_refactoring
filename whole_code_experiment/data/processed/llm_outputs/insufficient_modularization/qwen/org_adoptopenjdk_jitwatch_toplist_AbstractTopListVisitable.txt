    "justification": "The class has a clear single responsibility of building top lists from JIT compilation data. It contains minimal functionality with only essential methods for initialization, tag visiting, and top list construction. The class is abstract and serves as a base for extension, maintaining appropriate cohesion and limited complexity. No bloated interface or excessive responsibilities are present."
