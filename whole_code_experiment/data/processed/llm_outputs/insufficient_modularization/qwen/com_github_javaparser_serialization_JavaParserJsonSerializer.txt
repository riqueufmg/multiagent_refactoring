    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JavaParserJsonSerializer is focused on a single responsibility: serializing JavaParser AST nodes to JSON. While it contains several methods, they are all cohesive and directly related to the serialization process. The class has a clear public interface with the main serialize method and protected methods that allow for customization. The presence of nested enums for JSON structure constants is appropriate for encapsulating related data. The class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant decomposition into multiple classes. All methods serve the core purpose of serialization, maintaining a consistent level of abstraction."
