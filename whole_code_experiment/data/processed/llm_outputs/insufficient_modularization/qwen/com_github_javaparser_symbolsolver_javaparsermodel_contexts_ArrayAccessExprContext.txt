    "justification": "The class ArrayAccessExprContext is small and focused, containing only a constructor and one method. It properly delegates functionality to its parent class ExpressionContext and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. The class represents a well-defined abstraction with clear responsibilities related to handling ArrayAccessExpr nodes in the context of symbol resolution."
