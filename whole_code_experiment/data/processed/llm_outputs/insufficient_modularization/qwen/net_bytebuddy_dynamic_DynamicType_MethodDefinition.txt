        "The class 'DynamicType.MethodDefinition' is an interface with an extremely large number of methods (over 100), indicating it has too many responsibilities.",
        "The interface contains multiple nested interfaces (ReceiverTypeDefinition, ImplementationDefinition, TypeVariableDefinition, ExceptionDefinition, ParameterDefinition, etc.) that further increase its complexity.",
        "The interface combines multiple concerns: method definition, field definition, record component definition, type variable handling, module definition, and builder patterns all within one interface structure.",
        "Many of the nested interfaces have deep inheritance hierarchies and multiple levels of abstraction, making the overall structure overly complex.",
        "The interface serves as both a builder and a definition container for various aspects of dynamic type creation, violating the single responsibility principle.",
        "The extensive use of generic types and complex type hierarchies within the interface makes it difficult to understand and maintain."
