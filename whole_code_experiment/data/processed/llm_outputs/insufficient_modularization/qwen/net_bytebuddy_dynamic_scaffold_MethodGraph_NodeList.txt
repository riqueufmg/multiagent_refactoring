        "The MethodGraph interface is extremely large, containing 14349 lines of code and multiple nested classes, interfaces, and enums that handle various aspects of method graph compilation, node representation, and graph construction.",
        "The class encompasses numerous responsibilities including method graph compilation logic (Compiler interface and its implementations), node representation (Node interface and its implementations), method resolution logic (Key, Store, Entry hierarchies), and graph representation (Graph class).",
        "Nested classes like Compiler.Default and its inner classes (Harmonizer, Merger, Key hierarchy, Store, Entry hierarchy) create deep nesting levels and increase complexity, making the class difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "The presence of multiple enums (Empty, Sort, ForDeclaredMethods, ForJavaMethod, ForJVMMethod, Directional) and their associated logic within the same file indicates a lack of proper decomposition.",
        "The class contains deprecated methods and complex generic type hierarchies that further contribute to its bloated interface and implementation.",
        "The extensive use of inner classes and interfaces within a single file suggests that responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions have been concentrated in one place."
