    "justification": "The class SimplePathVisitor is of reasonable size and encapsulates a single responsibility as a Path visitor with customizable behavior for visitFileFailed. It includes a nested abstract builder class which is appropriately related to its construction and configuration, contributing to its modularity rather than detracting from it. The class does not exhibit excessive complexity, bloated interface, or concentration of unrelated responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
