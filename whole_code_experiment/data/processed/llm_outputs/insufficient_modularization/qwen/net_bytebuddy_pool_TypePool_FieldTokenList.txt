    "justification": [
        "The TypePool interface contains 12 nested classes/interfaces with varying responsibilities, including Resolution, CacheProvider, Default, LazyFacade, and ClassLoading, indicating a lack of clear separation of concerns.",
        "The Default class, which is the primary implementation, contains over 20 nested classes with highly specialized responsibilities such as TypeExtractor, LazyTypeDescription, GenericTypeExtractor, and various annotation handling classes.",
        "The LazyTypeDescription class alone contains 30+ nested classes for handling different aspects of type descriptions like FieldTokenList, MethodTokenList, GenericTypeToken, AnnotationToken, etc., making it extremely large and complex.",
        "The class has multiple levels of nested classes (up to 4-5 levels deep in some cases), which indicates excessive complexity and insufficient decomposition of responsibilities.",
        "The overall size of the file and the number of lines of code (over 4000 lines) suggest that the abstraction represented by TypePool has not been adequately decomposed into smaller, more cohesive modules."
