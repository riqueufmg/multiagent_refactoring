    "class": "ReedSolomonEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of performing Reed-Solomon encoding. It encapsulates the encoding logic and manages generator polynomials caching. The class is relatively small (less than 50 lines), has low complexity, and a focused interface with only three public methods (constructor, buildGenerator, encode). There is no evidence of bloated interface or concentrated responsibilities that could be separated into smaller abstractions."
