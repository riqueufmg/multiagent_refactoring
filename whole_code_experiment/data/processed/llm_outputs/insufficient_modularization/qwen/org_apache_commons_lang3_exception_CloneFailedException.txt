    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CloneFailedException is a well-defined exception class with minimal responsibilities. It extends RuntimeException and provides three constructors for different scenarios, which is appropriate for its purpose. The class has a clear single responsibility of representing a clone failure exception, is not excessively large, and does not exhibit complexity that would require further decomposition. The interface is not bloated and the class is easy to understand and maintain."
