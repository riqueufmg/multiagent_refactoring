    "justification": "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of handling authentication logic. It is of moderate size and complexity, with clear separation of concerns through the use of the AuthShim interface and the GlobalHandler nested class. The class encapsulates authentication handling effectively without undue complexity or bloating."
