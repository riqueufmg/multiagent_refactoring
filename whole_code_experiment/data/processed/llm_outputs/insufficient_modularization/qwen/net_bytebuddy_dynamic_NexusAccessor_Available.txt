    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class NexusAccessor is well-factored with clear separation of concerns. It encapsulates the logic for accessing and managing the Nexus singleton, delegating implementation details to appropriate inner classes (InitializationAppender, Dispatcher implementations) and maintaining a reasonable size and complexity. The responsibilities are adequately decomposed across the class and its inner classes/interfaces, avoiding bloated interfaces or excessive complexity within any single abstraction."
