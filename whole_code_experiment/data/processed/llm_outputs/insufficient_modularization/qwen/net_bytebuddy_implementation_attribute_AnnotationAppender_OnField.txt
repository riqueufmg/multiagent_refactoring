        "The class 'AnnotationAppender' is an interface and serves as a well-defined abstraction for writing annotations.",
        "It is properly decomposed into smaller, cohesive inner interfaces and classes such as 'Target', 'Default', and 'ForTypeAnnotations', each handling distinct responsibilities.",
        "The inner classes like 'OnType', 'OnField', 'OnMethod', etc., under the 'Target' interface encapsulate specific annotation targets without overlapping concerns.",
        "The 'Default' class handles the core logic of appending annotations while delegating visitor-specific operations to the 'Target' implementations, maintaining clear separation of concerns.",
        "The 'ForTypeAnnotations' class manages type annotation visiting logic separately, adhering to single responsibility principle.",
        "There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface in the 'AnnotationAppender' class; it maintains a clean and modular structure."
