    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FieldParser is a well-focused utility class responsible for parsing fields in a specific data format (RSS expanded decoder). While it contains several static initialization blocks for mapping data lengths, these are cohesive and directly related to its core responsibility of field parsing. The class has a clear single purpose, with all methods and fields tightly related to parsing logic. The inner class DataLength is also minimal and serves only to encapsulate data length information. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
