        "Helper classes like AlwaysTruePredicate, NamePredicate, ThreadIdPredicate, and interfaces ThreadGroupPredicate and ThreadPredicate are logically related and kept as inner classes, which is acceptable for utility classes.",

        "There is no bloated interface or mixing of unrelated concerns. All functionalities pertain to thread operations, predicates, and utility functions."
