    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class StreamDrainer is a small, focused utility class with a single responsibility: draining an InputStream into a byte array. It has only one public method (drain) and minimal supporting fields and constructors. The class is well-scoped, easy to understand, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. All elements are cohesive and serve the single abstraction of stream draining."
