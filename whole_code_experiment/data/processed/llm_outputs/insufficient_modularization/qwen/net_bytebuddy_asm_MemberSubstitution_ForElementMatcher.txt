        "The class 'MemberSubstitution' is excessively large with numerous nested classes and interfaces, leading to high complexity and making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "It contains multiple levels of nested classes (e.g., 'WithoutSpecification' and its nested classes, 'TypePoolResolver' and its nested classes, 'Target' and its nested classes, 'Substitution' and its extensive nested structure, 'Replacement' and its nested classes, 'SubstitutingMethodVisitor' and its nested classes, and various annotation interfaces), which indicates a lack of proper decomposition.",
        "The class handles multiple responsibilities including member substitution logic, type pool resolution, target representation, substitution strategies, replacement binding, and visitor pattern implementation for bytecode manipulation, which violates the Single Responsibility Principle.",
        "The extensive use of generic types and complex type hierarchies within the class increases its cognitive complexity and makes it harder to decompose and understand.",
        "The class has a large number of methods and fields, contributing to its bloated interface and making it challenging to navigate and modify."
