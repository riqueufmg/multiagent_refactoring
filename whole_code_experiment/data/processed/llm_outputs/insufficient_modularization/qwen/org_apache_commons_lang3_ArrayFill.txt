    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ArrayFill is a utility class with a single responsibility: providing static methods to fill arrays. It has only 11 methods, all closely related to its core purpose. The class is small, cohesive, and well-focused. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
