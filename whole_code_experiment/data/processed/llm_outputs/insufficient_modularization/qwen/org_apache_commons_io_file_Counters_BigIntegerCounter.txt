    "class": "Counters",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Counters is well modularized. It contains multiple small, cohesive inner classes (BigIntegerCounter, LongCounter, NoopCounter, AbstractPathCounters and its subclasses) and interfaces (Counter, PathCounters) that each have a single responsibility. The outer class acts as a factory and namespace for these components. The class is not excessively large or complex, and responsibilities are appropriately separated into distinct abstractions."
