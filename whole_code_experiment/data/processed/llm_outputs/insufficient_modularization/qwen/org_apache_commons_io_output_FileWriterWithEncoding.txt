    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "FileWriterWithEncoding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class exhibits good modularization by delegating construction logic to a dedicated Builder class, encapsulating initialization complexities within private methods like 'initWriter', and maintaining a clear separation of concerns. While it contains multiple constructors, these are managed through proper overloading and deprecation practices, and do not indicate bloating or lack of cohesion."
