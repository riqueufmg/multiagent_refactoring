    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "CountingPathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CountingPathVisitor is well-factored and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. It focuses on a single abstraction: counting files, directories, and sizes during a file visit. The class is of moderate size and complexity, with clear separation of concerns. Supporting responsibilities such as filtering and counter management are delegated to other classes (e.g., PathFilter, PathCounters, Builder pattern). The use of a nested AbstractBuilder and Builder class further demonstrates proper modularization by encapsulating object construction. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would indicate insufficient modularization."
