    "justification": "The Resolvable interface is a minimal, well-defined abstraction with a single method 'resolve()'. It adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. The interface is properly focused on its core responsibility of resolving a type T, making it sufficiently modular."
