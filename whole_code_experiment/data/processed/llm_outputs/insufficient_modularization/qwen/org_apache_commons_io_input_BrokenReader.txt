    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BrokenReader is small and focused, implementing only the necessary methods from the Reader abstract class to fulfill its purpose of always throwing an exception. It has a clear single responsibility: to simulate a broken reader for testing purposes. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. It contains only essential constructors, fields, and overridden methods required for its functionality, making it well-modularized."
