        "The class 'TypeWriter.Default' is excessively large with numerous nested classes and interfaces, making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "It contains multiple levels of nested classes (e.g., 'ForInlining', 'ForCreation', 'RedefinitionClassVisitor', etc.) that could be separated into their own files or modules.",
        "The class handles various responsibilities including class file creation, redefinition, rebasing, and decoration, which could be separated into distinct classes or modules.",
        "The presence of large inner classes like 'RedefinitionClassVisitor' with many nested classes (e.g., 'InitializationHandler', 'WithDrain', 'WithoutDrain') indicates a lack of proper decomposition.",
        "The class has a high number of fields and methods, contributing to its complexity and making it harder to manage and evolve."
