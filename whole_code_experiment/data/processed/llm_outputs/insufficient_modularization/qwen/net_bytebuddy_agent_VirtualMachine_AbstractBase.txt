    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class VirtualMachine.AbstractBase is an abstract class with only three simple method implementations that delegate to other methods with default parameters. It does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. The class has a single, well-defined responsibility of providing default implementations for the loadAgent, loadAgentPath, and loadAgentLibrary methods, making it a properly modularized component within the larger VirtualMachine interface hierarchy."
