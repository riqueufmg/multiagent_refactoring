    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The EncodeHintType enum is a well-encapsulated enumeration that defines a fixed set of encoding hints. It has a single responsibility of representing different encoding options and their documentation. The class is not excessively large or complex, and each enum constant is clearly defined with appropriate Javadoc comments. The enum does not contain any methods or additional logic that would indicate bloated functionality or inadequate decomposition. This is a proper use of an enum to represent a closed set of options, and it adheres to good modularization principles."
