        "The VirtualMachine class is excessively large with 21486 lines of code, making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "The class contains multiple nested classes (ForHotSpot, ForOpenJ9, AbstractBase) and interfaces (Connection, Dispatcher) that implement different functionalities, indicating a lack of proper decomposition.",
        "The class handles various responsibilities including VM attachment for different platforms (Windows, Solaris, POSIX), connection management, property handling, and agent loading, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.",
        "Complexity is increased by platform-specific implementations scattered throughout the class rather than being properly modularized.",
        "The class exposes a bloated interface with numerous methods for different VM operations, contributing to its insufficent modularization."
