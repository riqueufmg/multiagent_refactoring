    "justification": [
        "The class has an excessive number of methods (over 100 visit methods), each handling a specific node type in the AST, leading to a bloated interface.",
        "The class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by consolidating visiting logic for all node types into one class, making it difficult to understand and maintain.",
        "The repetitive structure of the visit methods indicates a lack of decomposition that could be addressed by modularizing the visiting logic into separate, cohesive classes or components.",
        "The class size and complexity make it challenging to evolve and extend, as changes to one node type's visiting logic may impact the overall class structure."
