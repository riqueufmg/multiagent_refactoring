    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "TypeVariableSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TypeVariableSource is an interface that defines a clear and cohesive abstraction for representing code elements that can declare type variables. It has a well-defined set of responsibilities including type variable management, visitor pattern implementation, and generic declaration checks. The class is not excessively large or complex, and its interface is not bloated. The inclusion of nested interfaces and abstract base classes is appropriate for supporting the main abstraction without indicating insufficient decomposition. The class maintains good cohesion and reasonable size, thus does not exhibit the Insufficient Modularization smell."
