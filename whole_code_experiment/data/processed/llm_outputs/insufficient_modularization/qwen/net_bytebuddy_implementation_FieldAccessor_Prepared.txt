    "justification": [
        "The class FieldAccessor is excessively large, containing 11289 lines of code, which indicates high complexity and lack of proper decomposition.",
        "It encompasses multiple nested classes (Absolute, Relative, Prepared, ForImplicitProperty, ForSetter, etc.) that handle distinct responsibilities such as field location resolution, field name extraction, and various setter implementations.",
        "The class implements multiple interfaces (PropertyConfigurable, AssignerConfigurable, OwnerTypeLocatable) and contains numerous methods that span different abstraction levels, from high-level configuration to low-level bytecode manipulation.",
        "The presence of deeply nested classes like ForSetter.OfParameterValue, ForSetter.OfDefaultValue, ForSetter.OfConstantValue, ForSetter.OfReferenceValue, and ForSetter.OfFieldValue indicates that the class is managing too many specific behaviors without adequate separation of concerns.",
        "The class handles various aspects of field access including bean property conventions, field resolution strategies, assignment logic, and bytecode generation, all within a single class hierarchy rather than delegating to specialized components."
