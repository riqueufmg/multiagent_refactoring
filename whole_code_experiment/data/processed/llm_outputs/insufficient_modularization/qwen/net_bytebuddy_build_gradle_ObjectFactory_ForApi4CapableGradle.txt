    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ObjectFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ObjectFactory is well-structured with a clear single responsibility of creating objects using Gradle's ObjectFactory API. It uses a nested interface Dispatcher with two implementations (ForLegacyGradle and ForApi4CapableGradle) to handle different Gradle versions, which demonstrates good separation of concerns. The class is relatively small (approximately 100 lines), has a focused purpose, and does not exhibit excessive complexity or bloated interface. The design follows the factory pattern appropriately and maintains good cohesion."
