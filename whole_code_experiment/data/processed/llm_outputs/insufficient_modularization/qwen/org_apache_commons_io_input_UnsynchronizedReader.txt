    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "UnsynchronizedReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class UnsynchronizedReader is small and focused, containing only essential methods for managing a non-synchronized Reader. It has a clear abstraction representing an unsynchronized reader with minimal responsibilities: handling closure state, basic reading operations, and skipping characters. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. All methods are cohesive and directly related to the core functionality of the class. Therefore, it does not demonstrate the characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
