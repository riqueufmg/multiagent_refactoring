        "The TypeWriter interface is excessively large, containing over 48,000 lines of code when considering its nested classes and implementations.",
        "It encompasses multiple responsibilities including field pooling, method pooling, record component pooling, type validation, class file creation, inlining, and decoration.",
        "The class contains deeply nested inner classes (e.g., MethodPool.Record implementations, ValidatingClassVisitor and its nested classes) that increase complexity.",
        "There are numerous inner interfaces and their implementations (FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool) all contained within the same top-level interface.",
        "The class handles various type creation scenarios (creation, redefinition, rebasing, decoration) without adequate separation of concerns.",
        "Complexity is increased by the extensive use of generics, multiple inheritance-like structures through interfaces, and numerous utility methods.",
        "The single interface contains too many cohesive abstractions that could be separated into distinct, more focused modules."
