    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class PrefixingRandom is small and focused, implementing only the name method from the abstract base class AbstractBase. It has a single responsibility of generating names with a prefix and random suffix. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. All fields (prefix and randomString) are directly related to its single responsibility, and the logic in the name method is straightforward. Therefore, it does not represent an abstraction that has not been adequately decomposed."
