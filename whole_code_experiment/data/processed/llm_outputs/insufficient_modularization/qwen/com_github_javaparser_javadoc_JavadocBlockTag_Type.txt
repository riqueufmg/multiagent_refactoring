    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "JavadocBlockTag",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JavadocBlockTag is well-focused on representing a Javadoc block tag with clear responsibilities. It encapsulates the tag's type, content, and optional name, providing constructors, getters, and utility methods like toText(), equals(), hashCode(), and toString(). The inner enum Type is also appropriately scoped and manages tag types effectively. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. Therefore, it does not demonstrate the characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
