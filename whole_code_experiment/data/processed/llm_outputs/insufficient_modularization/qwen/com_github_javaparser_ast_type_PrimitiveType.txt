    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "PrimitiveType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class PrimitiveType is well-focused on representing a primitive type in the JavaParser AST. It encapsulates the type information through the nested Primitive enum, which handles boxing, descriptors, and type mappings. The class is of moderate size, has a clear single responsibility, and does not exhibit excessive complexity or a bloated interface. Helper methods and factory methods are appropriately grouped, and the use of annotations and generated code indicates automated maintenance of boilerplate, supporting modularization rather than hindering it."
