        "The DynamicType interface contains 63017 lines of code, indicating excessive size.",
        "The class encompasses multiple responsibilities including type definition, bytecode manipulation, module definitions, field and method definitions, and loading strategies.",
        "Nested interfaces and builders (e.g., Builder, ModuleDefinition, FieldDefinition, MethodDefinition) contribute to the class's complexity and size.",
        "The class combines concerns of type representation, type building, and type loading which could be separated into distinct modules.",
        "Large number of methods (getBytes, saveIn, inject, toJar, etc.) and nested types indicate a bloated interface.",
        "Complexity is increased by extensive use of generics, transformers, and attribute appenders throughout the class structure."
