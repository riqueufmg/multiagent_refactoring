    "justification": [
        "The class 'InvokeDynamic' is excessively large, containing over 2300 lines of code, which indicates high complexity and lack of decomposition.",
        "It encompasses multiple responsibilities including bootstrap method handling, argument provisioning, type handling, and bytecode manipulation, which should be separated into distinct cohesive abstractions.",
        "The class contains numerous inner interfaces and classes (e.g., 'InvocationProvider', 'ArgumentProvider', 'TerminationHandler') that increase its complexity and size, suggesting a need for decomposition into separate modules.",
        "The presence of many 'with*' methods (e.g., 'withBooleanValue', 'withArgument', 'withField') indicates a bloated interface that could be better managed through modularization."
