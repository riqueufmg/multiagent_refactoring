        "The class 'MemberSubstitution' is extremely large with a size of 73355 characters, indicating high complexity and excessive responsibilities.",
        "The class contains multiple nested classes (WithoutSpecification, ForMatchedDynamicInvocation, ForMatchedByteCodeElement, ForMatchedField, ForMatchedMethod, etc.) that could be extracted into separate files or modules.",
        "The class handles various responsibilities including member substitution logic, field access replacement, method invocation replacement, constructor call replacement, and dynamic invocation handling, which suggests a lack of clear separation of concerns.",
        "The presence of numerous inner classes and interfaces (Target, Substitution, Replacement, etc.) with their own nested structures indicates that the class has not been adequately decomposed into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.",
        "The class includes complex logic for handling different types of substitutions (field, method, constructor, dynamic) and multiple configuration options, contributing to its bloated interface and making it difficult to understand and maintain."
