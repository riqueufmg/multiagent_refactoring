    "class": "JavaParserJsonSerializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JavaParserJsonSerializer is well-focused on its responsibility of serializing AST nodes to JSON. It has a clear separation of concerns with helper methods for writing different parts of the JSON structure (e.g., writeRange, writeTokens, writeToken). The class is of moderate size and does not exhibit excessive complexity or a bloated interface. The inner enums (JsonNode, JsonRange, JsonTokenRange, JsonToken) are used for organizing JSON property keys and are appropriately encapsulated within the class. Overall, the class demonstrates sufficient modularization."
