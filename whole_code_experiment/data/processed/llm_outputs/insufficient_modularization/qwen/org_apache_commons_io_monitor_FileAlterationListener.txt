    "justification": "The class is a well-defined interface with a single, clear responsibility: to receive file system modification events. It has only 8 methods, all closely related to file and directory change notifications. The interface is cohesive, focused, and appropriately sized, with no signs of bloating or excessive complexity. There is no evidence of responsibilities that could be separated into smaller abstractions."
