    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The FieldDescription interface and its nested classes are well-factored and maintain clear separation of concerns. The interface defines a cohesive abstraction for field descriptions with several specialized implementations (ForLoadedField, Latent, TypeSubstituting) and supporting classes (Token, SignatureToken) that handle distinct responsibilities. Each class has a clear, single purpose - representing different forms of field descriptions (loaded, latent, substituted) or supporting data structures (tokens). The complexity is appropriately distributed across these specialized types rather than concentrated in one large class. The interface hierarchy properly separates generic and defined shape concerns through its nested interfaces. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interfaces that would indicate insufficient modularization."
