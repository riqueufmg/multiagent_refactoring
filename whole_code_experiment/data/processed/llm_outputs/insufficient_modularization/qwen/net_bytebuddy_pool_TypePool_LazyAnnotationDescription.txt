    "justification": [
        "The class 'TypePool.LazyAnnotationDescription' is excessively large, containing over 67,000 lines of code, which indicates high complexity and lack of decomposition.",
        "It encapsulates multiple responsibilities including lazy resolution of type descriptions, handling of generic types, annotation processing, and management of type variables, which should be separated into distinct, cohesive abstractions.",
        "The class contains deeply nested inner classes and extensive method implementations, making it difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve.",
        "The presence of numerous inner classes and large methods suggests that the class has not been adequately decomposed into smaller, more manageable components."
