    "class": "CsmList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CsmList is well-factored with a single responsibility of handling list printing in the concrete syntax model. It has a clear interface with appropriate constructors and getter methods. The prettyPrint method, while somewhat complex due to handling different node types and separator logic, is cohesive and directly related to the class's core responsibility. The class size is reasonable (approximately 100 lines) and does not exhibit excessive complexity or bloated interface. The design follows good separation of concerns by delegating printing operations to other CsmElement instances and ConcreteSyntaxModel."
