    "justification": "The class VINResultParser is appropriately focused on parsing VIN codes and contains a cohesive set of methods related to VIN validation and parsing. While it has several private helper methods, they all serve the single responsibility of parsing and validating VINs. The class is of moderate size and does not exhibit excessive complexity or a bloated interface. The methods are well-organized and each serves a specific purpose in the VIN parsing process, maintaining good cohesion and reasonable decomposition."
