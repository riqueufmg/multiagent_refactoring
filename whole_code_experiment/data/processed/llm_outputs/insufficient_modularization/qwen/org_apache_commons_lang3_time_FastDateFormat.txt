    "justification": [
        "The class has a single, well-defined responsibility: providing a fast and thread-safe version of SimpleDateFormat.",
        "It effectively delegates formatting and parsing responsibilities to FastDatePrinter and FastDateParser respectively, promoting good separation of concerns.",
        "The class serves as a facade, offering a clean API while hiding the complexity of its internal components.",
        "While the class contains numerous factory methods, these are logically grouped and necessary for providing multiple ways to instantiate the formatter, which aligns with its role as a central access point in the library.",
        "The design follows the principle of delegation, avoiding the concentration of too many unrelated responsibilities within a single class."
