    "justification": "The class Java16Validator is a small, focused class that extends Java15Validator and only adds or removes specific validations related to Java 16 features. It has a single constructor that performs a limited set of operations, and its responsibilities are well-defined and cohesive. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface, and it properly delegates validation logic to its parent class and other components."
