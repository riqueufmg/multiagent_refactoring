        "The class PackageDefinitionStrategy is an interface that contains multiple nested classes and enums, including NoOp, Trivial, Definition (with nested Undefined, Trivial, Simple), and ManifestReading (with nested SealBaseLocator interface and its implementations NonSealing, ForFixedValue, ForTypeResourceUrl).",
        "This results in a large and complex class structure with many responsibilities, violating the principle of single responsibility.",
        "The class represents multiple abstractions (package definition strategies, package definitions, seal base locators) that are not adequately decomposed into separate, cohesive modules.",
        "The ManifestReading class itself contains multiple nested classes that handle different strategies for locating seal bases, increasing its complexity and size.",
        "The presence of numerous inner classes and enums within a single top-level class indicates that the abstraction has not been sufficiently modularized."
