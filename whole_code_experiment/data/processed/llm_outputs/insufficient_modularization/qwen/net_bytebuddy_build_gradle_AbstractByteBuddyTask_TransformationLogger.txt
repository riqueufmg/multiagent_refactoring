    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "AbstractByteBuddyTask",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class AbstractByteBuddyTask, while large and complex, represents a cohesive abstraction for a Gradle task that applies Byte Buddy transformations. It encapsulates configuration properties, transformation logic, and plugin discovery mechanisms related to Byte Buddy processing. The class is well-organized with clear method responsibilities, proper separation of concerns through inner classes (TransformationLogger, ByteBuddySkippingUrlClassLoader), and maintains a single responsibility for Byte Buddy task execution. The complexity arises from the inherent functionality of integrating Byte Buddy with Gradle rather than poor modularization. The inner classes are appropriately scoped and the class does not expose a bloated interface - it provides necessary configuration points for a complex build task."
