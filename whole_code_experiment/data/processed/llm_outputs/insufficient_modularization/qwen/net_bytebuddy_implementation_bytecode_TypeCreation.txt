    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TypeCreation is small and focused, encapsulating only the logic for creating a type instance via bytecode manipulation. It has a single responsibility: representing a stack manipulation for type creation. The class contains only essential methods (constructor, factory method 'of', and 'apply') directly related to its core purpose. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface that would indicate insufficient decomposition."
