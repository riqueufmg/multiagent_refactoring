    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Streams is a utility class with only static methods and a private constructor to prevent instantiation. It has a clear single responsibility of handling stream operations for JSON elements. The class is small (less than 100 lines), has low complexity, and a focused interface. The inner class AppendableWriter and its nested CurrentWrite class are tightly related to the stream writing functionality and appropriately encapsulated. No excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface is present."
