        "The Binder class is excessively large, containing over 7800 lines of code, which indicates high complexity and lack of decomposition.",
        "It encompasses multiple responsibilities including annotation binding logic, field resolution strategies, bytecode manipulation implementations, and proxy type generation.",
        "Nested classes such as FieldResolver and its inner classes (ForGetter, ForSetter, etc.) along with AccessorProxy and related implementations are tightly coupled within the same file, violating the principle of separation of concerns.",
        "The class handles various aspects like constructor implementation for static and instance fields, getter and setter method implementations, and auxiliary type creation, all within a single class structure."
