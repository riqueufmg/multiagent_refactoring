    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The DirectoryWalker class, while large, represents a single cohesive abstraction for walking directory hierarchies. It has a clear purpose and well-defined responsibilities around directory traversal, filtering, and lifecycle event handling. The class follows the Template Method pattern with many protected callback methods that subclasses can override, which is an appropriate design for this type of framework class. The size is justified by the comprehensive functionality it provides, including various filtering options, depth limiting, cancellation support, and detailed lifecycle callbacks. The class is also marked as deprecated, suggesting it's maintained for legacy reasons rather than being actively developed, which explains some of its bulk. The internal CancelException class is appropriately nested since it's tightly coupled to the DirectoryWalker's cancellation mechanism."
