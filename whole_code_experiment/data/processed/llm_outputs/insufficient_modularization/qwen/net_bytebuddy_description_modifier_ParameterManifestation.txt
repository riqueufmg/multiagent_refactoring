    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ParameterManifestation is a well-designed enum with only two instances (PLAIN and FINAL) and a small, focused set of methods. It has a single responsibility of representing parameter manifestation states and their associated masks. The class is concise, easy to understand, and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. All methods are cohesive and directly related to the parameter manifestation abstraction."
