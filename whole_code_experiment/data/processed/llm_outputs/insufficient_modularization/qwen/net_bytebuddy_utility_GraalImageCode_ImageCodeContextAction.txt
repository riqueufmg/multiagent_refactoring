    "class": "GraalImageCode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class GraalImageCode is an enum with a clear and focused responsibility of resolving Graal VM native image properties. It contains a reasonable number of fields (2), methods (5 public + 2 private = 7 total), and nested types (1 protected enum). The methods are cohesive and related to the core abstraction. The class does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. The nested enum ImageCodeContextAction is logically related and contributes to the main responsibility without overcomplicating the design. Therefore, it does not represent an insufficiently modularized abstraction."
