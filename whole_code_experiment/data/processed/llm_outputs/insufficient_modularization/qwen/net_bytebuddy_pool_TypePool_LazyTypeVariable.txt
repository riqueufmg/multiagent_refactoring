    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TypePool.LazyTypeVariable is a nested class within the TypePool interface and is designed to represent a single, well-defined abstraction - a lazy type variable in the context of generic type handling. The class has a clear and focused responsibility: to provide a lazy implementation of a generic type variable with bounds that are resolved on demand. It does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. The class has a cohesive set of methods and fields that are all related to its core responsibility. It properly delegates complex operations to other components and maintains a clear separation of concerns. The class is well-structured with appropriate inner classes that support its main functionality without creating unnecessary complexity. Therefore, it does not demonstrate the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
