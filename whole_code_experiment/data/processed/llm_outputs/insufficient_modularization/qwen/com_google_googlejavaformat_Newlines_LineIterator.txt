    "justification": "The class Newlines is a well-focused utility class that provides a cohesive set of static methods for newline handling. While it contains multiple methods, they all serve the single responsibility of platform-independent newline processing. The two private inner classes (LineOffsetIterator and LineIterator) are directly related to the core functionality and are appropriately encapsulated. The class maintains good cohesion with all methods relating to newline detection, counting, and iteration, without exposing a bloated public interface. The size and complexity are justified by the scope of responsibilities, which are adequately decomposed into related components."
