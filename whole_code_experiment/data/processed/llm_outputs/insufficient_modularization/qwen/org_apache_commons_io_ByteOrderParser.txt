    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ByteOrderParser is a small, focused utility class with a single responsibility: parsing strings to ByteOrder instances. It contains only one public method and a private constructor to prevent instantiation, which aligns with the principles of sufficient modularization. The class is not large or complex enough to warrant decomposition into smaller classes, and its interface is minimal and cohesive."
