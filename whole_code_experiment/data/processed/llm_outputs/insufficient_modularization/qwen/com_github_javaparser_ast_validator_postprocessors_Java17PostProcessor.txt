    "justification": "The class Java17PostProcessor is a minimal extension of Java16PostProcessor with no additional methods, fields, or complex logic. It serves as a simple inheritance-based version marker for Java 17 processing, which does not indicate excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface. The class adheres to the single responsibility principle by focusing solely on version-specific processing without introducing additional responsibilities."
