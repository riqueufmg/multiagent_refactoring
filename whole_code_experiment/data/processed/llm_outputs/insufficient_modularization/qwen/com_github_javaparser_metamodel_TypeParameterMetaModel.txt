    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TypeParameterMetaModel is a small, focused class with only a constructor and two public fields. It represents a simple abstraction for metadata about type parameters and does not exhibit excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface. The class has a single responsibility of defining the metamodel for TypeParameter nodes, and its minimal implementation suggests adequate modularization."
