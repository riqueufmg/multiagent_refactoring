    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class UserLookupService is small and focused, implementing only the UserPrincipalLookupService interface. It has only two main public methods (lookupPrincipalByName and lookupPrincipalByGroupName) and delegates principal creation to simple static helper methods. The class contains two inner classes (JimfsUserPrincipal and JimfsGroupPrincipal) that are logically related and necessary for the implementation. The overall size is modest (approximately 957 characters), and the responsibilities are well-cohesive, centered around user and group principal lookup and creation. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or bloated interface."
