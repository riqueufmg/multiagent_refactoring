    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a reasonable number of classes (ArrayAccess, ArrayFactory, CollectionFactory, ArrayLength) that are focused on bytecode manipulation for collections and arrays. None of the classes are excessively large in terms of lines of code or responsibilities. Each class has a well-defined purpose: ArrayAccess handles array element access, ArrayFactory creates arrays, CollectionFactory is an interface for collection creation, and ArrayLength accesses array length. The code is well-structured with proper separation of concerns and does not exhibit the characteristics of a God Component."
