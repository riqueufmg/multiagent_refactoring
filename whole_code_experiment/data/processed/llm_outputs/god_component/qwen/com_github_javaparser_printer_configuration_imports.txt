    "justification": "The package contains only three classes (DefaultImportOrderingStrategy, IntelliJImportOrderingStrategy, and EclipseImportOrderingStrategy), each with a single responsibility related to import ordering strategies. None of the classes are excessively large in terms of lines of code or complexity, and they do not accumulate responsibilities that would indicate a God Component smell."
