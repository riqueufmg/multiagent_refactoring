    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.description' contains multiple small, focused interfaces and classes, each handling specific aspects of Java element descriptions such as NamedElement, DeclaredByType, TypeVariableSource, ModifierReviewable, and ByteCodeElement. None of the individual components are excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of classes. The design follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns, which does not indicate the presence of a God Component."
