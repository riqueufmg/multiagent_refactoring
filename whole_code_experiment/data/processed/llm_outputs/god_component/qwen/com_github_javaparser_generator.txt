The classes are well-organized with clear responsibilities: AbstractGenerator provides common functionality, CompilationUnitGenerator handles compilation unit generation, Generator is an abstract base class, NodeGenerator manages node generation, and VisitorGenerator creates visitor classes. No single class dominates the codebase in terms of size or responsibility."
