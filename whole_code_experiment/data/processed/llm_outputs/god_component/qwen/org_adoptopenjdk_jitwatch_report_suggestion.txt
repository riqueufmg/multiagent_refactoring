    "justification": "The class SuggestionWalker contains 5357 characters, which is relatively large but not excessively so for a single class. It encapsulates logic related to walking through JIT compilation suggestions and generating reports, which is a cohesive responsibility. There is no indication that it manages multiple unrelated concerns or an excessive number of classes. Therefore, it does not qualify as a God Component based on the provided context."
