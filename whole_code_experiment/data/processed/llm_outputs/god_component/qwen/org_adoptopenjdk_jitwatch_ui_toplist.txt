    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.toplist",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TopListStage has 198 lines of code and encapsulates a single responsibility related to UI presentation of top lists. While it contains several initialization logic for different top list wrappers, it does not exceed reasonable complexity thresholds for a God Component. The class TopListWrapper is a simple data holder with 3 fields and associated getters. Neither class shows excessive size in terms of lines of code or number of classes within the package that would indicate a God Component smell."
