    "justification": "The class HotSpotLogParser contains 3636 lines of code, which is large but not excessively so for a complex parser. The class is focused on parsing HotSpot logs, with methods handling specific aspects like header parsing, compilation lines, assembly lines, and tag handling. There is no indication of excessive number of classes within the component, and the responsibilities, while numerous, are cohesive to the task of log parsing."
