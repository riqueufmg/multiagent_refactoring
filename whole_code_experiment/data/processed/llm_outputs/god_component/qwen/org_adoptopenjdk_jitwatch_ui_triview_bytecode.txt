    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.bytecode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only two classes, BytecodeLabel and ViewerBytecode. BytecodeLabel is a simple class with minimal functionality, encapsulating a bytecode instruction. ViewerBytecode, while more complex, is focused on handling bytecode viewing logic within the UI and does not exceed typical complexity or size thresholds for a God Component. There is no evidence of excessive responsibilities or size at the package level."
