    "justification": "The package contains only three small, well-defined classes (StatsTableBuilder, StatsTableRow, and StatsStage) with clear responsibilities. None of the classes are excessively large in terms of lines of code or complexity, and they follow a logical separation of concerns for building and displaying statistics in a UI."
