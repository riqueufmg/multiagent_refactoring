    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains multiple small, focused classes (MutableByte, MutableBoolean, MutableDouble, MutableInt, MutableShort, MutableLong, MutableObject, MutableFloat) and one interface (Mutable), each responsible for a specific mutable type. None of the classes are excessively large in terms of lines of code or responsibilities, and they follow a consistent, cohesive design pattern for mutable value wrappers."
