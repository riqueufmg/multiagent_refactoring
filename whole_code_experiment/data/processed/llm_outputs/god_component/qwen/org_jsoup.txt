    "justification": "The Jsoup class, while being the main entry point for the library, does not excessively grow in terms of Lines Of Code or number of classes. It encapsulates core functionalities such as parsing HTML, connecting to URLs, and cleaning HTML, which aligns with its role as a facade. The class maintains a cohesive responsibility set without becoming unwieldy in size or scope."
