    "justification": "The package contains multiple focused classes, each handling specific printing responsibilities. For example, PrettyPrintVisitor and DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor handle AST to source code printing, XmlPrinter handles XML output, and DotPrinter handles Graphviz output. The classes are reasonably sized and have distinct responsibilities, not indicating a single excessively large component."
