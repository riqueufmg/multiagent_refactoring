    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only two classes (JavaSymbolSolver and SourceFileInfoExtractor) with a reasonable number of lines of code. JavaSymbolSolver, while being the main class, does not exceed typical complexity thresholds for a God Component. It encapsulates symbol resolution logic without excessive class or method count. SourceFileInfoExtractor is a utility class with clear responsibilities. There is no evidence of excessive size in terms of LOC or number of classes."
