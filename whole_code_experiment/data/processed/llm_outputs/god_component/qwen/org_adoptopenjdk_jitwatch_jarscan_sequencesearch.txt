    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only two classes (FoundSequence and SequenceSearchOperation), both of which are small and focused. FoundSequence is a simple data class with basic fields and methods, while SequenceSearchOperation implements a specific bytecode sequence search functionality without excessive complexity or size. Neither class exceeds typical thresholds for being considered a God Component in terms of lines of code or responsibilities."
