    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes/interfaces with well-defined responsibilities: FunctionalInterfaceLogic (functional interface handling), MethodResolutionCapability (interface for method resolution), ConflictingGenericTypesException (exception class), InferenceContext and InferenceVariableType (type inference logic), and MethodResolutionLogic (method resolution algorithms). None of the classes exceed typical size thresholds for a god component, and they represent cohesive, related functionality for type resolution logic without excessive LOC or class count."
