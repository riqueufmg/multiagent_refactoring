    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ReflectionHelper, although containing multiple methods related to reflection operations, does not exceed typical size thresholds for a God Component. It encapsulates functionality related to record support and reflective access in a cohesive manner. The class is well-organized with clear responsibilities around making objects accessible and handling record-related reflection, which aligns with single responsibility principles rather than indicating a God Component smell."
