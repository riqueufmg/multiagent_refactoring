    "justification": "The package contains multiple focused benchmark classes (TrivialClassCreationBenchmark, StubInvocationBenchmark, ClassByExtensionBenchmark, SuperClassInvocationBenchmark, ClassByImplementationBenchmark) each with a specific responsibility related to benchmarking different aspects of the ByteBuddy library. While the classes are large due to benchmarking requirements, they are not excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of classes, and each maintains a clear single responsibility for benchmarking specific functionality."
