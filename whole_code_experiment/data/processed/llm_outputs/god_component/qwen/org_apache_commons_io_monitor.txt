    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes, each with well-defined responsibilities. FileEntry represents file state, FileAlterationObserver manages file system observation logic, FileAlterationMonitor handles periodic monitoring, FileAlterationListener and its adaptor define event callbacks, and SerializableFileTime provides a serializable wrapper for FileTime. The classes are focused, cohesive, and there is no single class that excessively concentrates functionality or lines of code."
