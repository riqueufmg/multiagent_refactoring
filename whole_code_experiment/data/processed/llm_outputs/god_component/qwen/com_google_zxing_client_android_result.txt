    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains multiple small, focused classes, each handling a specific type of result (e.g., ProductResultHandler, EmailAddressResultHandler, URIResultHandler). None of the individual classes are excessively large in terms of lines of code or responsibilities. The base class ResultHandler encapsulates common functionality, but it is appropriately abstract and does not centralize too many responsibilities. The overall design follows a modular, single-responsibility approach."
