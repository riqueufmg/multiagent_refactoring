    "justification": "The package contains 34 classes, each with focused responsibilities related to functional interfaces that handle IOExceptions. The classes are cohesive and follow single responsibility principles, implementing specific functional interfaces like IOFunction, IOPredicate, IOConsumer, etc., along with their adapters and utility classes. No single class or component is excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of classes."
