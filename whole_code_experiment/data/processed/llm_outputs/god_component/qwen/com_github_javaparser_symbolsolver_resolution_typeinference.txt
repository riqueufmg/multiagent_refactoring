    "justification": "The package contains multiple cohesive classes related to type inference, each with distinct responsibilities. No single class exceeds typical size thresholds for being considered a God Component, and the functionality is well-distributed across several specialized classes such as BoundSet, TypeInference, ConstraintFormula, and others. The design follows separation of concerns, with each class handling specific aspects of type inference logic."
