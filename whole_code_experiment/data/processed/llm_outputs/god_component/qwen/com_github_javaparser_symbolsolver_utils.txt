    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes, none of which are excessively large in terms of lines of code or complexity. Each class has a well-defined responsibility: SymbolSolverCollectionStrategy handles collection of source roots and type solving, ModuleLayerHelper deals with module layer reflection, FileUtils provides file utility methods, and JavassistModuleHelper handles module information parsing. The package does not exhibit characteristics of a God Component as it is neither excessively large nor does it concentrate too many responsibilities in a single class."
