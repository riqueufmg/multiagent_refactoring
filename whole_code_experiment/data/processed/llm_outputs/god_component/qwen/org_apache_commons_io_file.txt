    "justification": "The package contains multiple focused classes with distinct responsibilities. For example, DeletingPathVisitor handles file deletion during traversal, CountingPathVisitor counts files and directories, and PathUtils provides general NIO path utilities. No single class is excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of classes. Each class has a well-defined purpose, indicating good separation of concerns and adherence to the single responsibility principle."
