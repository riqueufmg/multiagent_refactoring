    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with minimal code content. Class A is nearly empty containing only a nested class definition. The nested class DuplicateTypeName is also empty. The abstract class DuplicateTypeName contains no implementation. None of the classes exceed typical size thresholds for a God Component, and the overall package is small and focused."
