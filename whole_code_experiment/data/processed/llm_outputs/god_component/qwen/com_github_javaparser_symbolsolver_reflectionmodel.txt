    "justification": "The package contains multiple focused classes, each handling specific aspects of reflection-based type resolution. Key classes like ReflectionClassDeclaration, ReflectionInterfaceDeclaration, and ReflectionFactory are large but cohesive, with clear responsibilities. No single class or component dominates the package by LOC or class count excessively."
