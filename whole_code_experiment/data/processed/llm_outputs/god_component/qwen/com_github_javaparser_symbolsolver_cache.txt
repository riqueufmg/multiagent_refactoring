    "justification": "The package contains only four small, well-defined classes (InMemoryCache, NoCache, GuavaCache, and DefaultCacheStats), each with a single responsibility related to caching. None of the classes exceed a significant number of lines of code, and the overall package is focused on providing different cache implementations and statistics, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle."
