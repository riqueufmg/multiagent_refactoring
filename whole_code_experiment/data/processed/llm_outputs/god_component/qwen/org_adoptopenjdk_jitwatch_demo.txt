    "justification": "The class MakeHotSpotLog contains 3115 characters, which is relatively small for a God Component. It has a single class and its purpose is well-defined: to generate a HotSpot log for demonstration. The methods are mostly private, small, and focused on specific tasks related to JIT compilation analysis. There is no excessive number of classes or lines of code that would indicate a God Component smell."
