    "justification": "The package contains 14 classes, each with well-defined responsibilities and no single class dominating the codebase in terms of lines of code or functionality. The classes handle distinct aspects such as bit manipulation (BitMatrix, BitArray), encoding/decoding (ECIEncoderSet, MinimalECIInput, ECIStringBuilder), binarization (HybridBinarizer, GlobalHistogramBinarizer), and data structures (DetectorResult, DecoderResult). There is no evidence of a single component excessively large in LOC or number of classes."
