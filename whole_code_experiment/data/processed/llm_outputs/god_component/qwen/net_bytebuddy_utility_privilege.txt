    "justification": "The package contains only three small, focused classes (GetSystemPropertyAction, GetMethodAction, SetAccessibleAction), each implementing a single-responsibility privileged action. None of the classes are excessively large in terms of lines of code or complexity, and the package as a whole does not exhibit the characteristics of a God Component."
