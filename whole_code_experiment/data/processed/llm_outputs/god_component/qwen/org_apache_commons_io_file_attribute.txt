It contains 17 methods and approximately 200 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The class is well-focused on its purpose, with all methods related to time manipulation and conversion between different time formats (Unix, NTFS, FileTime, Date). There is no indication of it being a God Component based on size or number of responsibilities."
