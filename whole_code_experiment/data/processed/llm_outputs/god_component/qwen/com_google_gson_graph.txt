    "justification": "The class GraphAdapterBuilder, despite being the only class in the package, is not excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of inner classes. It contains well-defined responsibilities for handling graph serialization and deserialization, with clear encapsulation of related functionality into inner classes (Factory, Graph, Element). The total LOC is within reasonable limits for a specialized utility class, and the structure supports single responsibility and separation of concerns."
