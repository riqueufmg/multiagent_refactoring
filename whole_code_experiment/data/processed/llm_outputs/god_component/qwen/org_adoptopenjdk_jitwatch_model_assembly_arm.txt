    "justification": "The package contains only 6 classes, each with a well-defined and focused responsibility. These classes handle different aspects of ARM assembly parsing and modeling, such as mnemonics, registers, directives, and parsing logic. None of the classes are excessively large in terms of lines of code or complexity, and the overall design follows a modular structure appropriate for its domain."
