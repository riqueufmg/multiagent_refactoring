    "justification": "The package contains 21 classes, each with a well-defined responsibility. The classes are cohesive and focused on barcode encoding, decoding, and related utilities. No single class or component is excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of classes. The design follows separation of concerns with distinct classes for exceptions, data structures, interfaces, and implementations."
