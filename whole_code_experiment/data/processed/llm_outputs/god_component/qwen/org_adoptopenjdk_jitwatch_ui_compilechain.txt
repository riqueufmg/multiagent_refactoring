    "justification": "The class CompileChainStage has a moderate size with a clear, single responsibility of visualizing compile chains. While it contains UI logic, rendering, and event handling, it is not excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of inner classes to qualify as a God Component. The class is focused on its purpose and does not manage multiple unrelated concerns."
