    "justification": "The package contains 14 classes, each with distinct responsibilities. The largest class, DecodeServlet, while substantial, is focused on decoding logic and related HTTP handling. Other classes handle specific concerns such as DoS filtering, HTTPS redirection, and chart generation. The distribution of responsibilities across multiple classes indicates that no single component is excessively large or responsible for too many unrelated tasks."
