    "justification": "The package contains multiple cohesive classes related to different types of comments (e.g., LineComment, BlockComment, JavadocComment, MarkdownComment, TraditionalJavadocComment) and a CommentsCollection class for managing them. Each class has a well-defined responsibility and the overall design follows a modular structure. None of the individual classes are excessively large in terms of lines of code or complexity, and the total number of classes is reasonable for the functionality provided."
