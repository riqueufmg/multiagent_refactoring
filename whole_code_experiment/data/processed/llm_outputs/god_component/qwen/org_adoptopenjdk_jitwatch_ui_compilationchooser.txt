    "justification": "The class CompilationChooser is small in terms of lines of code and number of methods. It has a single responsibility of managing a compilation chooser UI component, handling selection changes, and updating the UI based on compilation data. There is no evidence of excessive size or multiple responsibilities that would indicate a God Component smell."
