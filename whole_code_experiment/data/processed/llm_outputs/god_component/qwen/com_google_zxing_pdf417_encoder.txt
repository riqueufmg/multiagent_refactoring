    "justification": "The package contains multiple cohesive classes with distinct responsibilities: PDF417 handles high-level encoding logic and barcode generation, PDF417ErrorCorrection manages error correction codewords, PDF417HighLevelEncoder deals with text/byte/numeric compaction, BarcodeMatrix and BarcodeRow manage barcode matrix representation, Compaction defines encoding modes, Dimensions holds dimension constraints, and PDF417HighLevelEncoderTestAdapter provides test access. No single class or component is excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of classes."
