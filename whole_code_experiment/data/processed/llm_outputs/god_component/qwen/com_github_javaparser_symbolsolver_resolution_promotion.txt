    "justification": "The package contains only four small, focused classes that handle specific aspects of conditional expression resolution. Each class has a well-defined responsibility: ReferenceConditionalExprHandler, ConditionalExprResolver, NumericConditionalExprHandler, and BooleanConditionalExprHandler. The total lines of code across all classes are modest, and there is no excessive concentration of functionality or responsibilities in any single component."
