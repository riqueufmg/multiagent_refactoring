    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.jsoup.internal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes, each with distinct responsibilities: SimpleStreamReader (IO decoding), SoftPool (object pooling), Functions (utility functions), SharedConstants (shared constants), ControllableInputStream (input stream control), SimpleBufferedInput (buffered input), StringUtil (string utilities), QuietAppendable (appendable wrapper), and Normalizer (string normalization). The classes are cohesive within the 'internal' package and do not exhibit excessive size in terms of lines of code or number of classes that would indicate a God Component smell."
