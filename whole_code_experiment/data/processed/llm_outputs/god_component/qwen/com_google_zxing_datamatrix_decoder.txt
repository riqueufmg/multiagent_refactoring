    "justification": "The package contains multiple cohesive classes, each with a specific responsibility: DecodedBitStreamParser handles bit stream decoding, Decoder manages error correction and decoding logic, Version encapsulates version-specific data, DataBlock manages data block structures, and BitMatrixParser handles parsing of the bit matrix. The responsibilities are well-distributed among these classes, and no single class exhibits excessive size or complexity that would indicate a God Component smell. The largest class, DecodedBitStreamParser, is focused solely on parsing different encoding modes and remains within reasonable complexity bounds for its functionality."
