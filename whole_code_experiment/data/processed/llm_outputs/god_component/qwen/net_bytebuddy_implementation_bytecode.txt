    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains many small, focused classes and enums, each responsible for specific bytecode manipulations. The classes are well-organized around the theme of stack manipulations and bytecode generation, without any single class or component being excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of classes. The design follows a modular approach where each class has a distinct responsibility, which contradicts the characteristics of a God Component."
