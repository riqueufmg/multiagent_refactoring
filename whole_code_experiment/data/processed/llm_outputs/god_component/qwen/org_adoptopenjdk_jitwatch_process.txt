    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only two classes (IExternalProcess and AbstractProcess) with a combined total of ~150 lines of code. The AbstractProcess class, while abstract, encapsulates external process execution logic but remains focused in scope and reasonably small in size. There is no evidence of excessive size or responsibility that would indicate a God Component."
