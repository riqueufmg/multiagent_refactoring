    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains multiple cohesive classes related to type representations in JavaParser. Each class has a well-defined responsibility (e.g., UnionType, ArrayType, PrimitiveType, etc.), and none of them are excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of inner classes. The design follows a clear hierarchy with a base Type class and specialized subclasses, indicating good separation of concerns rather than a single God Component."
