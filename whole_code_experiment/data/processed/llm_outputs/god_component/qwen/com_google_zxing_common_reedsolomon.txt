    "justification": "The package contains only 5 classes, each with a well-defined responsibility: ReedSolomonException (exception handling), GenericGF (Galois Field operations), GenericGFPoly (polynomial representation and operations), ReedSolomonEncoder (encoding functionality), and ReedSolomonDecoder (decoding functionality). None of the classes are excessively large in terms of lines of code or responsibilities, and they follow a clear separation of concerns for Reed-Solomon error correction implementation."
