    "justification": "The package contains only two classes, InliningRowBuilder and InliningRowBean, with a total of approximately 150 lines of code. Neither class is excessively large in terms of lines of code or complexity. The functionality is well-separated between a builder for UI table construction and a bean for data representation, adhering to single responsibility principles."
