    "justification": "The package contains only two classes, InstructionSequence and SequenceCountOperation, with moderate lines of code and clear separation of concerns. InstructionSequence represents a sequence of opcodes, while SequenceCountOperation handles scanning and counting logic. Neither class is excessively large in terms of lines of code or complexity."
