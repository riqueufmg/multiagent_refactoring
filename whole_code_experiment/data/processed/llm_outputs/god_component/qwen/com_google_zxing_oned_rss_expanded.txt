    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains four well-defined, cohesive classes (ExpandedRow, RSSExpandedReader, BitArrayBuilder, ExpandedPair), each with distinct responsibilities. None of the classes exhibit excessive size in terms of lines of code or number of methods that would indicate a God Component smell. The RSSExpandedReader, while being the most complex, is appropriately scoped to handle RSS expanded barcode decoding logic and does not excessively encapsulate unrelated responsibilities."
