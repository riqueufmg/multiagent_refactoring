    "justification": "The package contains 9 well-defined, cohesive classes, each responsible for a specific type of file comparison (e.g., path, name, size, extension, last modified, directory, default, composite, and reverse). Each class is small, focused, and follows the single responsibility principle. There is no single excessively large class or component that dominates the package in terms of lines of code or responsibilities."
