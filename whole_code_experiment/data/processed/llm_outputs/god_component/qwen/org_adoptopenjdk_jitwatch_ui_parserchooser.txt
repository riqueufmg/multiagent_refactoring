    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only two small classes (IParserSelectedListener and ParserChooser) with minimal responsibilities. The ParserChooser class has only 32 lines of code and encapsulates a simple UI component behavior, which does not constitute an excessively large component in terms of LOC or number of classes."
