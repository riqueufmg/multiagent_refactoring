    "justification": "The class 'Detector' contains 3472 characters, which is within a reasonable size for a single-purpose class responsible for detecting Data Matrix Codes. It encapsulates a single responsibility with a well-defined API and does not exhibit excessive complexity in terms of lines of code or number of methods that would indicate it is doing too much. The class focuses on detection logic and delegates sampling to another component (GridSampler), adhering to separation of concerns."
