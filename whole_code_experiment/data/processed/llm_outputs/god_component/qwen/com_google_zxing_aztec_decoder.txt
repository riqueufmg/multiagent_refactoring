    "justification": "The class Decoder, although large (~500 LOC), is cohesive and focused on a single responsibility: decoding Aztec codes. It does not contain excessive number of methods or unrelated functionalities. The class handles bit extraction, error correction, and data decoding, all of which are core to its purpose. No evidence of it being excessively large in terms of classes or lines to qualify as a God Component."
