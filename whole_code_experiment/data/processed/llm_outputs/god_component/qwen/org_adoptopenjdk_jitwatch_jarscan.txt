    "justification": "The class JarScan, while being the main entry point and coordinator for jar scanning operations, does not exceed typical complexity or size thresholds for a God Component. It encapsulates distinct responsibilities such as iterating over jars/folders, processing class files, delegating bytecode analysis to operation implementations, and handling command-line argument parsing and reporting. The class leverages an interface (IJarScanOperation) to delegate specific scanning behaviors, promoting separation of concerns. Although it has multiple methods, they are cohesive and serve the central purpose of the class without bundling unrelated functionalities."
