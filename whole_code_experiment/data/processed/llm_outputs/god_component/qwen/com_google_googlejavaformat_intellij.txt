GoogleJavaFormatConfigurable handles UI configuration, GoogleJavaFormatImportOptimizer manages import optimization, UiFormatterStyle manages formatting styles, Notifications handles error notifications, JreConfigurationChecker verifies JRE configuration, GoogleJavaFormatSettings manages plugin settings, and GoogleJavaFormatFormattingService handles code formatting. The classes are appropriately sized and have clear separation of concerns, with no single class dominating the codebase in terms of lines of code or responsibilities."
