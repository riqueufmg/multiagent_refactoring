    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 8 relatively small, focused classes (MutableByte, MutableBoolean, MutableDouble, MutableInt, MutableShort, MutableLong, MutableObject, MutableFloat) and one interface (Mutable), each with clear single responsibilities for mutable wrapper types. No single class is excessively large in lines of code or number of methods, and the package structure is cohesive with related functionality."
