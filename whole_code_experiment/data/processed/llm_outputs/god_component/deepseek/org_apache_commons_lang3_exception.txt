    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes with moderate to small sizes. The largest class (ExceptionUtils) has approximately 600 lines of code, which is substantial but not excessively large for a utility class. Other classes are much smaller (typically under 100 lines). The package demonstrates good separation of concerns with distinct exception types and utility functionality."
