    "justification": "The package contains only two classes (TopListStage and TopListWrapper). TopListStage has 260 lines of code, which is not excessively large. Both classes have focused responsibilities: TopListStage manages UI for displaying toplists, TopListWrapper is a simple data container. No evidence of excessive size in LOC or number of classes."
