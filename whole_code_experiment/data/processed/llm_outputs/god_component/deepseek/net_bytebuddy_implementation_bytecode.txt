    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 21 classes with significant code volume, including large classes like StackManipulation (over 300 lines) and ByteCodeAppender (over 150 lines). Multiple classes have nested inner classes/enums, and the package centralizes bytecode manipulation functionality with high cohesion but excessive size."
