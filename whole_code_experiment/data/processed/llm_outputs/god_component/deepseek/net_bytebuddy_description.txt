    "justification": "The package contains 25 classes/interfaces with extensive code duplication across multiple nested interface definitions (NamedElement, ModifierReviewable, TypeVariableSource, etc.), each repeated in separate class files. The total lines of code across all provided files is excessively large, and the package centralizes numerous related but distinct responsibilities within a single package structure."
