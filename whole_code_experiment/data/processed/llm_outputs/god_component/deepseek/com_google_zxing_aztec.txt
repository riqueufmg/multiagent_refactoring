    "justification": "The package contains only three classes: AztecDetectorResult (simple data holder, 55 lines), AztecWriter (focused encoding class, 85 lines), and AztecReader (decoding logic, 110 lines). Each class is small, focused, and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. No single class is excessively large in lines of code or number of responsibilities, and the package as a whole is cohesive and manageable."
