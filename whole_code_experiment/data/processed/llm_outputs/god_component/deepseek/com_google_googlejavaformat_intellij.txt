    "justification": "The package contains 7 distinct classes with focused responsibilities: configuration UI (GoogleJavaFormatConfigurable), import optimization (GoogleJavaFormatImportOptimizer), settings management (GoogleJavaFormatSettings), formatting service (GoogleJavaFormatFormattingService), and small utility classes (UiFormatterStyle, Notifications, JreConfigurationChecker). No single class is excessively large in LOC or responsibility, and the overall package structure shows appropriate separation of concerns."
