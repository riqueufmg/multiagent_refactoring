    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The MetaModelGenerator class is excessively large with 7543 lines of code, contains a massive static list of 94 node classes, and coordinates multiple complex generation tasks. It directly manages four other generator classes (NodeMetaModelGenerator, InitializeConstructorParametersStatementsGenerator, AstTypeAnalysis, InitializePropertyMetaModelsStatementsGenerator), centralizing too much responsibility and making the package heavily dependent on this single large component."
