    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 5 classes (AbstractGenerator, CompilationUnitGenerator, Generator, NodeGenerator, VisitorGenerator) with moderate sizes and clear single responsibilities. No single class is excessively large in lines of code or number of methods, and the package structure shows proper separation of concerns among generator types."
