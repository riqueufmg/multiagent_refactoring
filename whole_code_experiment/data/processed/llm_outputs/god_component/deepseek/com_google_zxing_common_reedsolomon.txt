    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 5 small, focused classes (ReedSolomonException, GenericGF, GenericGFPoly, ReedSolomonEncoder, ReedSolomonDecoder) with clear single responsibilities. No single class is excessively large in LOC or number of methods, and the overall package size is modest and well-structured for Reed-Solomon error correction implementation."
