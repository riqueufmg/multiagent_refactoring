    "justification": "The ReflectionHelper class contains 3 inner classes and approximately 300 lines of code, which is not excessively large. It has a single, cohesive responsibility of providing reflection utilities for Gson, including record support abstraction. The size is reasonable for its purpose and doesn't indicate a God Component."
