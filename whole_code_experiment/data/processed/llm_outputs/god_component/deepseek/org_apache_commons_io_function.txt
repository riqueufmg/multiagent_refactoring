    "justification": "The package contains 28 classes, which is an excessive number of classes for a single package. Many classes are functional interfaces with similar patterns (IO versions of standard Java functional interfaces), suggesting the package has taken on too many responsibilities and could be better organized into smaller, more focused packages."
