    "justification": "The package contains 15 classes with significant size and complexity, including PathUtils (over 1500 lines), CountingPathVisitor (over 400 lines), and FilesUncheck (over 400 lines). Multiple classes exhibit high responsibility with extensive method counts, complex inheritance hierarchies, and deep nesting of inner classes. The package centralizes numerous file system operations, visitor implementations, and utility functions, creating excessive cognitive load and maintenance challenges."
