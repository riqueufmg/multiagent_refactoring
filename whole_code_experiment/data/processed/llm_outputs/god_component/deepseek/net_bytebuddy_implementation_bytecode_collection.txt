    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with moderate sizes (interfaces, enums, and classes with focused responsibilities). No single class exceeds 300 lines of code, and each class has a clear, cohesive purpose related to array/collection bytecode operations. The package structure shows appropriate separation of concerns without excessive complexity."
