Individual classes are not excessively large in lines of code or number of inner classes. The ClassByExtensionBenchmark includes three inner classes (ByteBuddyProxyInterceptor, ByteBuddyAccessInterceptor, ByteBuddyPrefixInterceptor) which are small and logically grouped with their parent benchmark."
