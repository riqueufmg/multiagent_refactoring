    "justification": "The package contains only 4 small classes (InMemoryCache, NoCache, GuavaCache, DefaultCacheStats) with low line counts. Each class has a single, focused responsibility related to cache implementations. No class is excessively large in LOC or number of methods, and the package as a whole is small and cohesive."
