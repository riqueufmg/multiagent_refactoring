    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The PDF417 class is excessively large with 600+ lines of code, contains multiple large static arrays (CODEWORD_TABLE with 3,000+ elements), and implements complex encoding logic spanning multiple responsibilities including barcode generation, dimension calculation, and low-level encoding. The package also contains PDF417HighLevelEncoder with 800+ lines, further contributing to the overall size and complexity of the component."
