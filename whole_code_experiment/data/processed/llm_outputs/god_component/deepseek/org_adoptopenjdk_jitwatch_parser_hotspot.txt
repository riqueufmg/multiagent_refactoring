    "justification": "The HotSpotLogParser class, while substantial, is not excessively large in lines of code and does not contain an excessive number of classes. It primarily handles log parsing responsibilities with focused methods, extending a base parser, and does not exhibit the extreme size or complexity characteristic of a God Component."
