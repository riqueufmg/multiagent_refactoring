    "package": "com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.main_jar",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 16 classes, which is a moderate number. The classes are small, focused, and follow single responsibility principles (interfaces, enums, concrete implementations). No single class is excessively large in LOC or responsibility, and the overall package size does not indicate a God Component."
