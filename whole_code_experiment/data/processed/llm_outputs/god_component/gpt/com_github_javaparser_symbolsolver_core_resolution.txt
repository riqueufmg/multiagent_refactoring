    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.core.resolution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains three small interfaces (MethodUsageResolutionCapability, SymbolResolutionCapability, TypeVariableResolutionCapability) each with a single, focused API method. There is no evidence of excessive lines of code or a large number of classes: each class snippet is brief and limited to one responsibility (solving method usage, resolving symbols, resolving type variables). The responsibilities are separated across interfaces rather than concentrated in a single large component, so the package does not meet the 'excessively large' criteria for a God Component."
