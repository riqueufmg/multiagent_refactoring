    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is dominated by a single, very large class (RSSExpandedReader) that contains numerous responsibilities and much of the package logic: decoding rows, managing state (pairs/rows/startFromEven), finder-pattern detection and parsing, data-character decoding (including large WEIGHTS/FINDER_PATTERNS static tables), checksum calculation, backtracking recursion, row storage/merging, and bit-level utilities. Although the package contains a few small helper classes (ExpandedRow, ExpandedPair, BitArrayBuilder), the concentration of many methods, large static data tables, and diverse responsibilities in RSSExpandedReader indicates an excessively large component and a violation of single responsibility, consistent with the God Component smell."
