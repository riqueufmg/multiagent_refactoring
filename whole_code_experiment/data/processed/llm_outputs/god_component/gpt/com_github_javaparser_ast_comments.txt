    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.comments",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a small, cohesive set of related classes (CommentsCollection, Comment, JavadocComment, TraditionalJavadocComment, MarkdownComment, BlockComment, LineComment — 7 classes). Responsibility is clearly separated: Comment is an abstract base, concrete classes represent different comment types, and CommentsCollection handles collection logic. No single class in the provided sources is excessively large in lines of code or number of responsibilities; functionality is distributed across multiple focused classes. Therefore the package does not exhibit a God Component smell based on the given information."
