    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains only two types (JarScan and the IJarScanOperation interface) while nearly all behavior and state is concentrated in the single class JarScan. JarScan is large and multi-responsibility: it implements CLI parsing (getParam, getParamString, getJarScanOperation, ARG_* constants, main, showUsage), file and archive traversal (iterateFolder, iterateJar), package filtering (allowedPackagePrefixes, isAllowedPackage), bytecode loading/processing (process, interaction with BytecodeLoader and MemberBytecode), reporting (writeReport), and processing control (counting, verbose flags, processableClassCount/processingClass fields). The class contains many methods, state fields and a large switch constructing many operation implementations, indicating high LOC and a monolithic design. These elements (concentration of functionality, many responsibilities, and large size) justify detection of the God Component smell."
