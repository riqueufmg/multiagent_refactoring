    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains three focused classes (WhiteRectangleDetector, MonochromeRectangleDetector, MathUtils) rather than an excessive number of classes. While WhiteRectangleDetector and MonochromeRectangleDetector have several methods for rectangle detection, they each implement a single, cohesive responsibility (detecting rectangular barcode regions) and MathUtils is a small utility class. There is no single class that accumulates unrelated responsibilities or an unusually large number of classes in the package, so the available code does not show the excessive size or class-count characteristic of a God Component."
