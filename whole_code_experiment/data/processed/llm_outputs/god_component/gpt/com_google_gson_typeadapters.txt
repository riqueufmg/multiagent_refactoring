    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed package contains a small number of cohesive classes (UtcDateTypeAdapter, RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory, PostConstructAdapterFactory plus an inner PostConstructAdapter). While RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory and UtcDateTypeAdapter are relatively long, their code is focused on single, well-scoped responsibilities (polymorphic type adapter logic and ISO-8601 date parsing/formatting respectively). The package does not exhibit an excessive number of classes nor an unusually large monolithic component that centralizes unrelated responsibilities; responsibilities are separated into distinct classes. Therefore the information provided does not indicate a God Component in this package."
