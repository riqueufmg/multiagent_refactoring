    "justification": "The org.jsoup.safety package concentrates large, multi-responsibility classes. The Safelist class is very large: multiple static factory configurations (none, simpleText, basic, basicWithImages, relaxed), many configuration APIs (addTags/removeTags, addAttributes/removeAttributes, addEnforcedAttribute/removeEnforcedAttribute, addProtocols/removeProtocols, preserveRelativeLinks), validation and protocol logic (isSafeTag, isSafeAttribute, testValidProtocol, isValidAnchor, getEnforcedAttributes) and several nested typed classes (TagName, AttributeKey, AttributeValue, Protocol, TypedValue). The Cleaner class is also sizable and embeds traversal and transformation responsibilities (clean, isValid, isValidBodyHtml, copySafeNodes, createSafeElement) plus inner classes (CleaningVisitor, ElementMeta). The concentration of many methods, helper types and distinct responsibilities in these few classes (high LOC and many nested types) matches the God Component smell."
