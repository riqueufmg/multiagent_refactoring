    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.comparators",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only three small, focused classes (ClassComparator, MethodComparator, ParameterComparator). Each class implements a single Comparator with short, simple methods and limited responsibilities. There is no single excessively large class or an unusually high number of classes in the package, and code complexity/LOC for each class is low, so the God Component smell is not present."
