    "justification": "The package com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder contains excessively large, highly complex classes that centralize many responsibilities. In particular DecodedBitStreamParser is very large: it defines a Mode enum, many large static character tables, and numerous long decode* methods (decodeAsciiSegment, decodeC40Segment, decodeTextSegment, decodeAnsiX12Segment, decodeEdifactSegment, decodeBase256Segment, decodeECISegment) with complex switch logic and state management — indicating many responsibilities concentrated in one class. Version.buildVersions() contains a very large hard-coded table, adding substantial LOC to the package. BitMatrixParser and DataBlock also implement lengthy, intricate parsing logic (readCodewords, readUtah, readCorner*, extractDataRegion). The concentration of many lines of code and multiple heavy-weight classes in this single package matches the God Component smell (excessive size and complexity)."
