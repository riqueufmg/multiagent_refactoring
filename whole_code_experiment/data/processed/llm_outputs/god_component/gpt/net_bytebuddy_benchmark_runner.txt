    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The provided package contains a single, small class (QuickRunner) with a private constructor and one static main method. The class implements minimal, well-scoped behavior (building and running a JMH OptionsBuilder with a few include patterns and forks(0)). There is no evidence of excessive Lines Of Code, an excessive number of classes in the package, or concentrated responsibilities: the file is compact and focused on one task. Therefore, the information shows no sign of a God Component."
