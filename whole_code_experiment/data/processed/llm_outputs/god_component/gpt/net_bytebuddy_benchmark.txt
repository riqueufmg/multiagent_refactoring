    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a large number of very large classes and nested types that concentrate many responsibilities and a high LOC footprint. Examples: ClassByExtensionBenchmark (with numerous fields, setup logic and many @Benchmark methods plus multiple nested static interceptor classes ByteBuddyProxyInterceptor, ByteBuddyAccessInterceptor and ByteBuddyPrefixInterceptor), ClassByImplementationBenchmark (large with many default-value fields and many benchmark implementations), TrivialClassCreationBenchmark, StubInvocationBenchmark and SuperClassInvocationBenchmark. Several classes define many instance fields and dozens of benchmark methods, leading to a high class count and very large individual class sizes. The concentration of many related but distinct benchmarking behaviours and helper/interceptor classes in this single package indicates an excessively large component (many classes and high lines-of-code), consistent with the God Component smell."
