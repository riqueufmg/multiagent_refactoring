    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains multiple small, focused comparator classes (PathFileComparator, ExtensionFileComparator, SizeFileComparator, LastModifiedFileComparator, NameFileComparator, DefaultFileComparator, DirectoryFileComparator, CompositeFileComparator, ReverseFileComparator) plus a lightweight AbstractFileComparator. No single class is excessively large or doing many unrelated responsibilities: most classes implement a single compare() method and a few constructors/constants. Responsibilities are well separated (each comparator compares by a single criterion, CompositeFileComparator composes delegates, ReverseFileComparator simply reverses a delegate), so the code shows cohesion rather than a God Component."
