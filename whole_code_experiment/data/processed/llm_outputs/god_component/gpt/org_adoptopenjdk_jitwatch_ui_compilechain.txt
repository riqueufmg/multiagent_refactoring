    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single very large class CompileChainStage that mixes many responsibilities: UI construction (scene, controls, layout), rendering/plotting logic (buildNode, plotNode, show, showKey, getColourForCompilation), event handling (initialiseRectWithOnMouseClickedEventHandler), and domain traversal/building (buildTree using CompileChainWalker). The class has numerous methods, large methods with detailed drawing logic and state (many constants, fields like pane, scrollPane, rootNode, model, y, offsets), implements multiple interfaces (ICompilationChangeListener, IRedrawable) and extends Stage — indicating multiple roles. This concentration of functionality and size (long source with duplicated blocks in the provided input) meets the criteria for a God Component (excessively large component combining many concerns)."
