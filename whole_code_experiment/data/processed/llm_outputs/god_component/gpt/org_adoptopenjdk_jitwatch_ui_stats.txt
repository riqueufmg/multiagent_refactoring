    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stats",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only three small, cohesive classes (StatsTableBuilder, StatsTableRow, StatsStage). StatsTableRow is a tiny data/formatting class (two fields and accessors). StatsTableBuilder is a single-purpose factory to build a table (few lines). StatsStage holds UI wiring and a redraw method that assembles ~20 rows, but the class size and responsibilities remain limited and focused on presenting JIT statistics. There is no single excessively large class by LOC or an excessive number of classes in the package, so the God Component smell is not present."
