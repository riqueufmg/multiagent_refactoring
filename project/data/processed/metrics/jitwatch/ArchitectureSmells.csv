Project,Package,Smell,Description
jitwatch,(default package),God Component,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 106
jitwatch,(default package),God Component,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of LOC (Lines Of Code). The total LOC of the component: 42777
jitwatch,(default package),Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [PartialEscapeFail]; [PartialEscapeFail.EscapeConsumer]; [DoesItVectoriseValue]; [TestInner]; [TestInner.Inner1]; [TestInner.Inner2]; [EscapeTestUnboxing]; [ElisionTest]; [PolymorphismTest]; [PolymorphismTest.Coin]; [PolymorphismTest.Nickel]; [PolymorphismTest.Dime]; [PolymorphismTest.Quarter]; [LockEliminate]; [DoesItVectorise]; [OSRTest]; [EscapeTestMultipleFields]; [EscapeTestMultipleFields.Wrapper1]; [EscapeTestMultipleFields.Wrapper2]; [SafePointTest]; [InliningChains]; [StringBufferLockElision]; [CodeCacheBuster]; [EscapeTestManyFields]; [EscapeTestManyFields.Wrapper1]; [EscapeTestManyFields.Wrapper2]; [InlineSmallCode]; [InlineSmallCode.Point]; [EscapeTest]; [EscapeTest.Wrapper1]; [EscapeTest.Wrapper2]; [InlineElimAlloc]; [MegamorphicBypass]; [MegamorphicBypass.Coin]; [MegamorphicBypass.Nickel]; [MegamorphicBypass.Dime]; [MegamorphicBypass.Quarter]; [UpperCase]; [SimpleInliningTest]; [ElisionTest2]; [LoopUnroll]; [HotThrow]; [TrivialMethod]; [Branchless]; [Lambda]; [EscapeTestString]; [EscapeTestString.Wrapper1]; [EscapeTestString.Wrapper2]; [DeoptTest]; [Sort]; [IntrinsicTest]; [LockCoarsen]; [FooClassInDefaultPackage; IsUsedForTestingDefaultPackage]; [PartialEscapeFail]; [PartialEscapeFail.EscapeConsumer]; [DoesItVectoriseValue]; [TestInner]; [TestInner.Inner1]; [TestInner.Inner2]; [EscapeTestUnboxing]; [ElisionTest]; [PolymorphismTest]; [PolymorphismTest.Coin]; [PolymorphismTest.Nickel]; [PolymorphismTest.Dime]; [PolymorphismTest.Quarter]; [LockEliminate]; [DoesItVectorise]; [OSRTest]; [EscapeTestMultipleFields]; [EscapeTestMultipleFields.Wrapper1]; [EscapeTestMultipleFields.Wrapper2]; [SafePointTest]; [InliningChains]; [StringBufferLockElision]; [CodeCacheBuster]; [EscapeTestManyFields]; [EscapeTestManyFields.Wrapper1]; [EscapeTestManyFields.Wrapper2]; [InlineSmallCode]; [InlineSmallCode.Point]; [EscapeTest]; [EscapeTest.Wrapper1]; [EscapeTest.Wrapper2]; [InlineElimAlloc]; [MegamorphicBypass]; [MegamorphicBypass.Coin]; [MegamorphicBypass.Nickel]; [MegamorphicBypass.Dime]; [MegamorphicBypass.Quarter]; [UpperCase]; [SimpleInliningTest]; [ElisionTest2]; [LoopUnroll]; [HotThrow]; [TrivialMethod]; [Branchless]; [Lambda]; [EscapeTestString]; [EscapeTestString.Wrapper1]; [EscapeTestString.Wrapper2]; [DeoptTest]; [Sort]; [IntrinsicTest]; [LockCoarsen]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.99
jitwatch,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 7.43.
