    "justification": "Class has 187 LOC and 11 methods, indicating potential for size reduction. It contains two inner classes (Key and State) that could be extracted to separate files, reducing implementation complexity. The WMC of 15 suggests moderate method complexity that could benefit from further decomposition."
