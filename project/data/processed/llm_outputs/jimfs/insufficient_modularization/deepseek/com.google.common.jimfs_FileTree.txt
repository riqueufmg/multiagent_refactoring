```json
{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileTree",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 11 methods with only 3 being public, indicating many internal helper methods that could be extracted. With 142 LOC and WMC of 26, the class shows moderate complexity that could benefit from decomposition. The LCOM of 0.0 suggests high cohesion, but the number of methods and dependencies on multiple domain classes suggests the class may be handling multiple responsibilities within the file system domain."
