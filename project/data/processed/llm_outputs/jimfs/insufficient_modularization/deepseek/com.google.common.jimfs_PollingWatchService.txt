    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PollingWatchService",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 11 methods and 147 lines of code, indicating potential for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity. The presence of inner class PollingWatchService.Snapshot suggests related functionality that could be separated, and the high method count (nom=11) with moderate weighted method complexity (wmc=17) shows implementation complexity that could benefit from modularization."
