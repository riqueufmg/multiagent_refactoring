    "justification": "Class has high complexity with 26 methods (nom=26) and 49 weighted methods per class (wmc=49), indicating many responsibilities. Moderate LCOM (0.115) suggests some cohesion but insufficient decomposition given the size. High LOC (267) and 8 fields (nof=8) further indicate potential for modularization to reduce size and complexity."
