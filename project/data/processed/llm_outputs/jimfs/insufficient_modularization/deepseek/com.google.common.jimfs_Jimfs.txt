    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Jimfs",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods with only 4 being public, 88 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 12, indicating implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. The low LCOM value (0.25) suggests high cohesion, but the method count and complexity metrics show potential for modularization."
