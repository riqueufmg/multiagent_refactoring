    "justification": "The class has 20 fields (nof=20) and 216 lines of code (loc=216), indicating high complexity and size. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests all logic is elsewhere, but the large number of fields in a builder class suggests insufficient decomposition of configuration concerns."
