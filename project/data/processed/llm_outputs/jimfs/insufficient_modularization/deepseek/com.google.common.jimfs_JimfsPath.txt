    "justification": "High method count (nom=42) and high complexity (wmc=71) indicate the class handles multiple responsibilities. Low cohesion (lcom=0.095) suggests methods could be grouped into separate classes. Large size (loc=279) further supports that decomposition could reduce implementation complexity."
