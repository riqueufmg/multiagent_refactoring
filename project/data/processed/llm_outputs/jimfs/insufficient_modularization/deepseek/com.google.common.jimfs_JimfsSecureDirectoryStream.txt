    "justification": "The class has moderate size (119 LOC, 15 methods) with low complexity (WMC 18, LCOM 0.13) and minimal coupling (fanin 0, fanout 0). All methods are public except 3 private ones, indicating appropriate encapsulation. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity significantly."
