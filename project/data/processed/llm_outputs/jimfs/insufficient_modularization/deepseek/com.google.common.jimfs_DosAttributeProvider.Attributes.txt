    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 28 lines of code with no methods, indicating minimal implementation complexity. It inherits from BasicAttributeProvider, suggesting appropriate decomposition. The small size and lack of methods show sufficient modularization for its purpose."
