    "justification": "Class has 8 methods (nom=8) with high cohesion (lcom=1.0) and moderate complexity (wmc=26), suggesting insufficient decomposition despite only 2 classes (nc=2) and 129 lines of code (loc=129). The high method count with no inherited methods (dit=1) indicates potential for further modularization."
