    "justification": "Class has high number of fields (39) and methods (8) with 344 lines of code, indicating large size and potential for decomposition. The presence of inner classes (UnixHolder, WindowsHolder, OsxHolder, Builder) suggests related functionality that could be separated. Low cohesion (LCOM 0.375) further supports insufficient modularization."
