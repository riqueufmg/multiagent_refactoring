    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.GlobToRegex",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High method count (nom=38), high complexity (wmc=62), and large size (loc=330) indicate insufficient decomposition. The class has 38 methods with only 7 public methods, suggesting many private helper methods that could be extracted into separate classes. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and dependencies on only two internal classes further supports that the class is handling too many responsibilities internally."
