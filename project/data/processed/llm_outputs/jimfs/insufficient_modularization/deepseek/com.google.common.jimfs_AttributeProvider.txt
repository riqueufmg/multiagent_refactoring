    "justification": "Class has 16 methods (nom=16) with 12 public methods (nopm=12), high method count suggests insufficient decomposition. WMC=18 indicates moderate complexity, but high number of methods relative to LOC=101 suggests each method is small but numerous, indicating potential for grouping related methods into separate classes."
