    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=16, number of methods (nom)=2, WMC=2 (low complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). It has only one field (nof=1), no incoming/outgoing coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already small, low‑complexity, and well‑cohesive, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
