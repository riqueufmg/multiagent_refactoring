    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=330), many methods (nom=38) and fields (nof=13), and high implementation complexity (wmc=62). It exposes multiple public methods (nopm=7) while having no inheritance (dit=0) to distribute behavior. Although cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.184), the combination of high LOC, high WMC and many members indicates the class likely contains multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed (it also contains an internal State and depends on InternalCharMatcher), so further modularization would likely reduce size and complexity."
