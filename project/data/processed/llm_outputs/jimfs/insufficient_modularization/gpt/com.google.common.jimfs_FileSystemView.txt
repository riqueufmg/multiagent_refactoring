    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemView",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=546), high complexity (wmc=84), and many methods (nom=38, of which nopm=22 private), which indicate a large implementation surface and heavy internal logic that could be split. The class also depends on many distinct types (16 listed dependencies: RegularFile, Options, PathService, SymbolicLink, File, JimfsSecureDirectoryStream, Feature, AttributeCopyOption, JimfsFileStore, DirectoryEntry, Directory, Name, FileLookup, JimfsPath, FileSystemState, FileSystemView.DeleteMode), suggesting multiple responsibilities or interaction points. Although LCOM=0.0 suggests cohesion by some metric, the combination of high LOC, high WMC and many methods/dependencies supports that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
