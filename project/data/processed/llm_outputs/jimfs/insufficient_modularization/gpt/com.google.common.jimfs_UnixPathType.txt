    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.UnixPathType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods (4 public) and 49 LOC with a WMC of 11, indicating concentrated implementation complexity. Its LCOM is 0.6666666666666666, showing relatively low cohesion among methods. These factors (moderate size, high complexity, low cohesion) suggest the class mixes multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
