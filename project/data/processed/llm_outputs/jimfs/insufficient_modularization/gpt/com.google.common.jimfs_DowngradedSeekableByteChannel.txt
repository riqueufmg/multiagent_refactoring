    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=36, NOF=1, NOM=9, WMC=9 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low overall size, limited state and good cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is nil (DIT=0). These metrics do not exhibit the large size, high complexity, or mixed responsibilities that characterize Insufficient Modularization."
