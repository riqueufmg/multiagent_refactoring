    "justification": "Class shows small size and low complexity: LOC=34, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=3 (only fields), FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, and no dependencies. The lack of methods and low coupling indicate the class is not a large, undecomposed unit, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
