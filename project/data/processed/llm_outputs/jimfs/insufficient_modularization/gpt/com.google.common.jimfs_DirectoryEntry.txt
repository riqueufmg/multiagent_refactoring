    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: size is moderate (loc=107), method count is modest (nom=13, nopm=12), and complexity is not excessive (wmc=18). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), and external coupling is low (dependencies count=3, fanin=0, fanout=0). These elements suggest the class is reasonably cohesive and not overly large or complex, so further decomposition is not clearly warranted."
