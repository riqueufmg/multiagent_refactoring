    "justification": "Class is minimal and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: loc=5 (very small), nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable for an empty/minimal type). Given the lack of size, methods, complexity, or dependencies, there is no evidence this class should be further decomposed."
