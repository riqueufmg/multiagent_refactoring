    "justification": "The class is very small and contains no members: LOC=11, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=0, WMC=0. It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no listed package dependencies. Given the lack of methods/fields and minimal size/complexity, there is no evidence that it is insufficiently modularized or that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
