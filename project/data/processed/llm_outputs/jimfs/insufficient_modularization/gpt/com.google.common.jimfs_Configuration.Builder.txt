    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration.Builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 216) combined with many fields (nof = 20, nopf = 3) but no reported methods (nom = 0) or complexity breakdown (wmc = 0). The abnormal cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) and zero fanin/fanout indicate poor internal decomposition. The class also depends on multiple distinct configuration concerns (SystemFileTimeSource, FileTimeSource, WatchServiceConfiguration, PathType), suggesting it encapsulates several responsibilities that could be split into smaller, more focused modules or sub-builders."
