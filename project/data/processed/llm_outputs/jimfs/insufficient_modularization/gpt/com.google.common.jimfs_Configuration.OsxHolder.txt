    "justification": "Class is tiny and trivial: LOC=3, nof=1 (one field), nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods or measurable complexity to decompose and its only dependency is the enclosing Configuration. Given the minimal size and zero complexity metrics, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
