    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=36, nof=3 fields, nom=0 methods, WMC=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). There are no methods to decompose and no dependency evidence that the class contains multiple responsibilities. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem here. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
