    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=10, NOM=2, WMC=2, NOF=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and low complexity with only two methods and no fields, so there is no evidence it has not been decomposed further or that it contains multiple responsibilities requiring additional modularization."
