    "justification": "Class is small and has no behavioral complexity: loc=28, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=4. It has no public methods (nopm=0), no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single dependency on BasicAttributeProvider. LCOM=-1.0 indicates no detectable cohesion problem in this isolated view. Given the low size and complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
