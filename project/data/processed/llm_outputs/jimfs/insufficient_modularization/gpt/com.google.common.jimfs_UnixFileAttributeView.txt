    "justification": "The class is tiny and has no content to decompose: LOC=6, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=0, weighted method count (wmc)=0. It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the absence of size, complexity, or cohesion issues (lcom=-1.0) there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
