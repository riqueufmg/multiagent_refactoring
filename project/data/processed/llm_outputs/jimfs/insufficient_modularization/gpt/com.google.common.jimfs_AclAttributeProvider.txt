    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.AclAttributeProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Moderate size and complexity combined with low cohesion indicate insufficient decomposition: loc=79 and nom=9 (nopm=8) show multiple methods/responsibilities; wmc=14 indicates non-trivial internal complexity; lcom=0.7777777777777778 signals a notable lack of cohesion among methods/fields. The class has 4 fields (nof=4) but methods appear not well-grouped around cohesive responsibilities, and fanin=0/fanout=0 imply the complexity is internal rather than due to external collaborations. These elements together justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
