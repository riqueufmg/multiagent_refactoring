    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=19, NOM=2, WMC=3, NOF=1, NOPM=1. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 indicate limited coupling. Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion, the class contains only two methods and one field, so there is insufficient evidence that it has not been decomposed; splitting it further would likely increase fragmentation rather than reduce complexity. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
