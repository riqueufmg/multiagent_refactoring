    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsAsynchronousFileChannel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: high number of methods (nom = 18) with most being public (nopm = 16) implying many exposed responsibilities; relatively large size (loc = 141) and elevated complexity (wmc = 23) indicating implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposition. There are few fields (nof = 5) while method count is high, suggesting behavior is concentrated in one class. Although cohesion is reported low (lcom = 0.0), the combination of many public methods and high WMC/LOC supports refactoring into smaller, focused classes or components to reduce size and complexity."
