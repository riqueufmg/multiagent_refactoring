    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.SystemJimfsFileSystemProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large number of methods (nom = 25) with most being public (nopm = 22), moderate size (loc = 135) and elevated complexity (wmc = 27). Cohesion is low (lcom = 0.72), and there is no indication of decomposition via inheritance or children (dit = 0, nc = 0). Together these metrics indicate the class likely contains multiple responsibilities and would benefit from further decomposition."
