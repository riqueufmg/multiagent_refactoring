    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition: moderate size and complexity (loc = 97, WMC = 18) with a relatively large public surface (nom = 8 methods, nopm = 6 public methods, nopf = 2 public fields). Cohesion is not strong (LCOM = 0.375), suggesting related but separable responsibilities. The class contains concentrated functionality with no external dependencies reported (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Together these elements imply the class has multiple responsibilities and could be split into smaller, more focused classes to reduce complexity and public surface area."
