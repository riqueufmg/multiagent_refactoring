    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.DosAttributeProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 11 methods (nom=11) with 10 public methods (nopm=10) and 7 fields (nof=7) concentrated in 110 LOC, indicating substantial size and surface area. Complexity is moderate (wmc=14) while cohesion is low (lcom=0.818), which suggests the class groups multiple responsibilities. These factors (high method count and public API, nontrivial complexity, low cohesion and multiple fields) justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
