    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileTree",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows moderate size/complexity (LOC=142, WMC=26) but a relatively small API and method count (NOM=11, NOPM=3) and few fields (NOF=3). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0), indicating the methods are related and the class responsibilities are concentrated. There is no evidence of high coupling or wide external usage (fanin=0, fanout=0, limited listed dependencies), which reduces the need to split responsibilities. Taken in isolation, these metrics do not indicate an insufficient modularization smell that would justify further decomposition."
