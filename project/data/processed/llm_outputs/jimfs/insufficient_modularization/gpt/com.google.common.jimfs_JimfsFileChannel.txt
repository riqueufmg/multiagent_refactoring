    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileChannel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size (loc=553) and high implementation complexity (WMC=52) indicate the class contains a lot of code and complex logic. The class exposes many operations (nom=25, nopm=18), and maintains nontrivial internal state (nof=8), which together suggest multiple responsibilities or subcomponents. Although LCOM=0.08 shows methods are not highly fragmented, the combination of very high LOC, high WMC and many methods supports that further decomposition would reduce size and complexity. The class also depends on multiple collaborators (RegularFile, FileSystemState, Util), consistent with a coordinating role that could be split. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is detected."
