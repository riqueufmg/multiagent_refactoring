    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystem",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. Although the class has 22 methods (nom) and 129 LOC, its weighted method count (wmc=24) and number of fields (nof=8) are moderate and its LCOM is very low (0.090909...), indicating high cohesion. There is no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no coupling indicated by fanin/fanout (0/0). Taken in isolation, the class size and complexity do not strongly justify further decomposition."
