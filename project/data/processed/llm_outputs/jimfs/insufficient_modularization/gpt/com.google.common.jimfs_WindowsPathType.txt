    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=139 (large size), WMC=33 (high implementation complexity), NOM=8 with NOPM=4 (multiple methods/public behaviors), NOF=5 (several fields/state), LCOM=0.5 (only moderate cohesion). Additionally NC=0 and DIT=1 indicate no subclass decomposition. The combination of large size, high complexity and only moderate cohesion justifies that the class could be further decomposed."
