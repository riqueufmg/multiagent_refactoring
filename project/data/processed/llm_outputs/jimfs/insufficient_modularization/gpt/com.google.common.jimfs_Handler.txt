    "justification": "High lack of cohesion (LCOM = 0.8) indicates that the 5 methods (nom = 5) are not closely related; moderate complexity (WMC = 6) within a small file (LOC = 44) suggests multiple responsibilities packed into one class. Only 1 field (nof = 1) combined with low method cohesion implies methods do not share state and could be split into smaller, more focused classes or modules. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
