    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.AttributeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. Although the class defines a moderate number of methods (nom=16, nopm=12), the overall size is small (loc=101) and complexity is moderate (wmc=18). There are no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no inheritance (dit=0), which suggests a stateless/cohesive provider role rather than an undivided, large implementation. Cohesion metric is not indicating fragmentation (lcom=-1.0), and coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Taken in isolation, these elements imply the class is reasonably modular and does not show clear evidence that it must be further decomposed."
