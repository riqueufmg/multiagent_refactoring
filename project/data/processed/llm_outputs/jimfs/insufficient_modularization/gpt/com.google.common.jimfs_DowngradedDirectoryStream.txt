    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=16, NOM=3, WMC=3 indicate low size and complexity; LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. No fanin/fanout or external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization (no evidence it should be further decomposed)."
