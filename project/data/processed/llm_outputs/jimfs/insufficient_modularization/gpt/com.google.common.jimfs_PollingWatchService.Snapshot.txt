    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PollingWatchService.Snapshot",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc = 44), very low internal complexity (wmc = 0), no methods (nom = 0) and only one field (nof = 1), and no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics indicate the class is already small/cohesive and does not show signs that it requires further decomposition."
