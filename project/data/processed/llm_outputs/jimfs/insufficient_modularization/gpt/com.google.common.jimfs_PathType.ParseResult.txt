    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=35), very low structural complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0), only two fields (nof=2), and no coupling evidence (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no sign of a large, complex, or overly cohesive class that would benefit from further decomposition."
