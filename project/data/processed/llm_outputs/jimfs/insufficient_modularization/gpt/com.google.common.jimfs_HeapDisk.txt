    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.HeapDisk",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: size and complexity are moderate (loc=108, nom=10, wmc=14), number of fields is small (nof=5), and cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). There is no inheritance or subclassing pressure (dit=0, nc=0) and the public API surface is limited (nopm=8 of nom=10). Based on these elements taken in isolation, the class does not appear to require further decomposition."
