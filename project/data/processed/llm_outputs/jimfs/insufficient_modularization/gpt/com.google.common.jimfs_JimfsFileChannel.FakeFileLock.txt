    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is very small and not complex (loc=18, nom=0, wmc=0) with only one field (nof=1). It has no measured coupling or usage (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]), and no methods to decompose further. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
