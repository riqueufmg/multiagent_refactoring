    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PathService",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show clear signs of insufficient modularization: LOC is moderate (191) and WMC (31) indicates overall complexity is not extreme given NOM=22 (average per-method complexity is low). LCOM is low (0.136), which implies good cohesion (single responsibility rather than multiple unrelated responsibilities). There are no public fields (nopf=0) and no external coupling in the provided metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although NOF=13 is nontrivial, on its own it does not outweigh the cohesion and moderate complexity metrics, so further decomposition is not clearly justified based on the supplied data."
