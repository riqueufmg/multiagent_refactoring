    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=33, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=2, WMC=0, DIT=1, LCOM=-1.0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. Given the low size, zero method complexity, and lack of coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required in isolation."
