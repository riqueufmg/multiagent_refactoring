    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=40, WMC=5, NOM=3, NOPM=1, and only 1 field (NOF=1). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are minimal. Although LCOM=0.666 indicates some cohesion loss, the overall size and complexity do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
