    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.File",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected due to high implementation size and complexity in a single class: 34 methods (nom=34), 226 LOC, and high cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc=42). The class exposes a sizable API surface (nopm=14) while holding moderate state (nof=6) and only moderate cohesion (lcom=0.382), which together indicate multiple responsibilities concentrated in one class. dit=0 (no inheritance) and the single listed dependency (DirectoryEntry) do not offset the internal complexity. These metrics collectively suggest the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and is a candidate for further modularization."
