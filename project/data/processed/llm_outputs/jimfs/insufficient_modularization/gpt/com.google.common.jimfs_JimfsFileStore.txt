    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileStore",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High number of methods (nom = 28) and many public methods (nopm = 11) combined with non-trivial size (loc = 181) and high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 28) indicate the class holds substantial functionality. The class also references many collaborators (dependencies list of ~13 types), suggesting it handles multiple concerns. Although cohesion is relatively good (lcom = 0.178), the overall size and complexity warrant further decomposition to reduce responsibility concentration and implementation complexity."
