    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class is large and data-rich: LOC=344 and NOF=39 indicate substantial size/state. It exposes few methods (NOM=8, NOPM=7) relative to fields, suggesting it primarily aggregates configuration state rather than encapsulating a single, small responsibility. WMC=18 shows non-trivial internal complexity. The class also depends on multiple nested/platform-specific types (Configuration.Builder, Configuration.UnixHolder, Configuration.OsxHolder, Configuration.WindowsHolder) which implies multiple responsibilities (general configuration + platform variants + construction). Although LCOM=0.375 does not show extreme cohesion loss, the combination of high field count, size, and multiple role-bearing nested types indicates the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
