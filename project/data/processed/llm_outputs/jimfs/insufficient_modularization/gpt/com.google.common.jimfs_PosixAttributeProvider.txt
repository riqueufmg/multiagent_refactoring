    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is large and complex and likely combines multiple responsibilities: loc = 142 and wmc = 23 (high size and complexity), nom = 11 with nopm = 10 (many methods, most public), nof = 9 (many fields), and lcom = 0.818 (low cohesion). dit = 1 (minimal inheritance reuse) and the class has several dependencies (File, FileLookup, UserLookupService, BasicAttributeProvider), suggesting it coordinates multiple concerns. These elements together support that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity, i.e. insufficient modularization."
