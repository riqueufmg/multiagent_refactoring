    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is very small and simple (loc=10) with only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and no fields (nof=0). Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is low (wmc=2). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0). Inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). These metrics indicate no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
