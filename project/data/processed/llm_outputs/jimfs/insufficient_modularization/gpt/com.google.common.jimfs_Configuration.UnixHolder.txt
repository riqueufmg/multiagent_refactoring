    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration.UnixHolder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is minimal and shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: LOC=3, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, NC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0. It has no methods, a single field, zero complexity and zero coupling (depends only on the enclosing Configuration). These metrics indicate the class is already small and simple, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
