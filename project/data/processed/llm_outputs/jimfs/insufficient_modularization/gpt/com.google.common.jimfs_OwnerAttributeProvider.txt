    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.OwnerAttributeProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: relatively high method count (nom=7) and cyclomatic weight (wmc=12) while exposing very few fields (nof=2) and zero incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) — a pattern that often indicates multiple responsibilities implemented as independent methods rather than cohesive, field-centered behavior. The very low cohesion metric (lcom=1.0) is the strongest indicator that methods are not working on shared state and could be split into smaller, more focused classes/modules. Size (loc=66) combined with these cohesion/complexity metrics suggests the class can be decomposed to reduce complexity and improve modularity. Dependencies on File, FileLookup and UserLookupService further imply mixed concerns (file and user-related logic) that could be separated."
