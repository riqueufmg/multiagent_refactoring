    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: moderate size (loc=77) but zero methods (nom=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no external dependencies. While the class has 8 fields (nof=8), there is no evidence of high implementation complexity or multiple responsibilities that would justify further decomposition."
