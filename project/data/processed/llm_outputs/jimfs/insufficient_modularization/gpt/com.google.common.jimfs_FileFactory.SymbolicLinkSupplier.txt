    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=9, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method count (wmc)=0, number of fields (nof)=1, low coupling fanin=0 fanout=0. There is only a single dependency (com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsPath). Given the minimal size, lack of methods/complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
