    "justification": "Class exhibits small size and complexity: loc=15, nof=1, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0. Coupling is minimal: fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]. LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable/indicates no method-based cohesion concerns). Given the very low lines of code, no methods, zero complexity and no coupling, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
