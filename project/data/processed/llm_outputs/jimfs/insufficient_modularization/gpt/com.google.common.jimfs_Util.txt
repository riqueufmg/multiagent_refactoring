    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High lack of cohesion: LCOM = 0.857 (methods largely do not share common state). Concentrated complexity: WMC = 12 across NOM = 7 methods. Size and responsibility density: LOC = 67 with NOF = 5 fields and only NOPM = 1 public method, implying multiple internal/private behaviors. These metrics together indicate the class is not well decomposed and is a candidate for further modularization."
