    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC=96 and NOM=10 show moderate size; WMC=14 indicates only moderate complexity; LCOM=-1.0 suggests good cohesion; DIT=1 (shallow hierarchy) and FANIN=0/FANOUT=0 show low coupling. Given these elements in isolation, there is no strong evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
