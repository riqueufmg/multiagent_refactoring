    "justification": "The class is small and shows no internal structure that would benefit from further decomposition: loc=17, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=0, weighted methods complexity (wmc)=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. LCOM=-1.0 (no applicable cohesion data). No dependencies. Based on these metrics (an isolated analysis), there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
