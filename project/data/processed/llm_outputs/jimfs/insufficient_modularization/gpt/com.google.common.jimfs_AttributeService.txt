    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.AttributeService",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC=292) and high complexity (WMC=63) combined with many methods (nom=24, nopm=12) and a non-trivial number of fields (nof=8) indicate it likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be split. Although LCOM is low (0.0833) suggesting some cohesion, that cohesion does not offset the overall size and complexity. The class also depends on several distinct collaborators (AttributeProvider, File, AttributeCopyOption, FileLookup, Configuration, StandardAttributeProviders), suggesting it handles diverse concerns. These factors together justify further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
