    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Directory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high size (LOC = 267), many methods (NOM = 26), and high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC = 49). It also has a non-trivial number of fields (NOF = 8) and several public/accessible methods (NOPM = 10), suggesting multiple responsibilities or behavior clusters that could be split. Although LCOM = 0.115 indicates relatively good cohesion, the combination of LOC, NOM, and WMC supports refactoring into smaller, more focused classes or helper components to reduce size and implementation complexity."
