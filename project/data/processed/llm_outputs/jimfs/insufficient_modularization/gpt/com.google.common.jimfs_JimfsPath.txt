    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsPath",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 42) with a large public API (nopm = 37), substantial size (loc = 279) and high complexity (wmc = 71) indicate the class is doing many things. The small number of fields (nof = 3) combined with many methods suggests procedural grouping of responsibilities rather than well-factored subcomponents. Although cohesion is relatively high (lcom = 0.095), the overall size/complexity and broad public surface make further decomposition advisable. Dependencies listed (Options, PathService, Name, AbstractWatchService, JimfsFileSystem) also indicate multiple interacting concerns that could be separated into smaller classes or helpers."
