    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=88 and WMC=10 show moderate size/complexity, NOM=10 (7 public) is modest, LCOM=0.3 indicates reasonable cohesion, NOF=6 with NOPF=0 (no public fields) and fanin/fanout=0 indicate low coupling. Given these values, there is no strong evidence this class is overly large, complex, or low-cohesion and in need of further decomposition."
