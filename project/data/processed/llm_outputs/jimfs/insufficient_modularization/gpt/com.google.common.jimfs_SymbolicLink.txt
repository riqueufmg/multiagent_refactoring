    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, NOM=4 (NOPM=1), NOF=1. Low complexity: WMC=4. High cohesion: LCOM=0.0. Low coupling: FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, dependencies limited to 2 types. DIT=1 (shallow inheritance). These metrics indicate the class is already small, simple and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted."
