    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=17, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0 (no measurable complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems here. Given the low size, zero methods, and minimal complexity/coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
