    "justification": "Metrics indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=129 and WMC=26 (high complexity for 8 methods), NOF=9 (many fields), NOM=8 and NOPM=8 (several public operations), LCOM=1.0 (very low cohesion). The combination of high complexity, many fields, and maximal LCOM suggests the class implements multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
