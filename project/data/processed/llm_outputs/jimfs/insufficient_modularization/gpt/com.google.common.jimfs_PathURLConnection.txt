    "justification": "The class does not show strong signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=76 and NOM=6 indicate a small-to-moderate size; WMC=10 is moderate but not excessive; NOF=4 fields is small; LCOM=0.333 indicates reasonable cohesion. Additionally fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no external coupling in the provided data) reduce the need to split to manage dependencies. Given these metrics in isolation, there is insufficient evidence to justify further decomposition."
