    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=10, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, dependencies=[]. These values indicate low size and low complexity (single method, no fields, no external coupling). LCOM=-1.0 also does not suggest poor cohesion. There is no evidence this class has not been decomposed or would benefit from further modularization."
