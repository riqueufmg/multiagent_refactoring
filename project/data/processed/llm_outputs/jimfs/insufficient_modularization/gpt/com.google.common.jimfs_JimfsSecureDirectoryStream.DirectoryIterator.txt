    "justification": "Class analyzed in isolation has very small size and complexity: LOC=22, NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0, NOF=1 (one field), NOPF=0, NOPM=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. With no methods to decompose, minimal lines of code, and no coupling to other elements, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
