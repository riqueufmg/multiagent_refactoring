    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.AbstractWatchService",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: although the class has a moderate size (loc=187) and a relatively large number of fields (nof=14), its methods are few (nom=11) and overall complexity is moderate (wmc=15). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.1818), indicating related responsibilities rather than multiple unrelated ones. Coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (dit=0, nc=1) do not suggest hidden, unseparated responsibilities. These metrics collectively indicate the class is cohesive and not obviously a candidate for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
