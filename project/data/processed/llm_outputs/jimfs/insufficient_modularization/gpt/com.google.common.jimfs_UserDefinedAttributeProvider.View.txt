    "justification": "Not detected: the class shows no evidence of being a large, undecomposed unit. It has zero methods (nom=0) and zero fields (nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), zero fan-in and fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0), and shallow inheritance (dit=1). Although LOC=38, the lack of members and complexity means there is no metric-based indication that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
