{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a moderate size and complexity (LOC=103, WMC=20, NOM=10, NOPM=7), it has a small number of fields (NOF=4), low coupling in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0, only two listed dependencies), and very high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). These indicators suggest the class's responsibilities are focused and cohesive rather than a single large class that has not been decomposed. Therefore there is no clear evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
