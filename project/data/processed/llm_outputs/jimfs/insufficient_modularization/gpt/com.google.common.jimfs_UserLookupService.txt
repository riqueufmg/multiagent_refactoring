    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.UserLookupService",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows small size and low complexity (loc=71, nom=5, wmc=6), low number of fields (nof=2), and high cohesion (lcom=0.0). There are no incoming or outgoing coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no evidence it requires further decomposition."
