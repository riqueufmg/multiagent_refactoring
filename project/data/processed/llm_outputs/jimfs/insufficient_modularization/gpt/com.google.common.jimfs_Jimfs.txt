    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized (God) class: LOC = 88 (small), NOM = 8 with NOPM = 4 (moderate number of methods), WMC = 12 (moderate complexity), NOF = 3 / NOPF = 1 (few fields), LCOM = 0.25 (high cohesion). Fanin and fanout are 0 and only 4 explicit dependencies are listed. Together these show the class is reasonably small, cohesive, and not excessively complex, so there is no evidence here that it should be further decomposed."
