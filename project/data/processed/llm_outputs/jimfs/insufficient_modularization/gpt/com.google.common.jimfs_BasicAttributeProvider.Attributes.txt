    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC=50 (moderate size), NOF=8 (fields only), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods / no internal complexity), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling evidence). LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion signal) but overall the absence of methods and low complexity/ coupling provide no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
