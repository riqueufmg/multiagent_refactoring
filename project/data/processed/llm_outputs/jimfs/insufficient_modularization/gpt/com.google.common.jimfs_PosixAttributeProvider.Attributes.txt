    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=23, number of fields=3, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one listed dependency (com.google.common.jimfs.BasicAttributeProvider). DIT=2 does not by itself imply excessive size or complexity, and LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems here. Given the low size, zero method complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
