    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PathType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is relatively large and complex for a single unit (LOC=166, WMC=22) with many methods (nom=19, nopm=12) and a non-trivial number of fields (nof=8), which suggests multiple responsibilities that could be split. Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.421) rather than high, indicating the members are not tightly focused on a single concern. The class defines/relies on an inner ParseResult and has direct dependencies to platform-specific types (WindowsPathType, UnixPathType), implying parsing and platform-specific behavior are combined rather than separated. Taken in isolation, these metrics and dependencies indicate insufficient modularization and that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
