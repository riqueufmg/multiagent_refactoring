    "justification": "Class is small and non-complex: loc=18, nof=2 fields, nom=0 methods, wmc=0 cyclomatic complexity. Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Shallow inheritance (dit=1) and LCOM=-1.0 indicate high cohesion. Given the lack of methods and low size/complexity, there is no evidence this class requires further decomposition."
