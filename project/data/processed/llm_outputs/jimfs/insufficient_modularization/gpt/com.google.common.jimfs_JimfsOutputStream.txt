    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small (LOC=66) with a moderate number of methods (NOM=8, public methods=4) and modest complexity (WMC=12). It has few fields (NOF=4) and shows high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and dependencies are limited to two classes. These metrics indicate the class is reasonably sized and cohesive and does not show signs that it should be further decomposed."
