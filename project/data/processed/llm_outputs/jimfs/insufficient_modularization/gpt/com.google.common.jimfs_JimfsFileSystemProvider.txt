    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystemProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: a high number of methods (nom = 32) with many public members (nopm = 26) indicating a large API surface and multiple responsibilities; relatively large size (loc = 192); high complexity (wmc = 38) which suggests complex internal control flow that could be split; and dependencies on multiple related types (RegularFile, Options, JimfsFileChannel, JimfsFileSystem, JimfsPath, FileSystemView) implying it coordinates several roles. (Note: LCOM = 0.1875 is low, indicating reasonable cohesion, but the combination of method count, public method count, and high WMC supports refactoring into smaller classes.)"
