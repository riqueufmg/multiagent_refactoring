    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.RegularFile",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and complex: 467 LOC, 43 methods (19 public), and WMC = 81. It has 7 fields and shallow inheritance (DIT = 1). Fanin/fanout = 0 indicates most work is implemented inside this class rather than delegated. Although LCOM is low (0.0465) indicating cohesion, the high method count and high weighted method complexity strongly indicate the class carries multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
