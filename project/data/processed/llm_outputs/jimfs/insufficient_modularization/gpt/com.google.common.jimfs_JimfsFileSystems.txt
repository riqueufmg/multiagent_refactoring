    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate clear insufficient modularization: LOC=78 (moderate size), NOM=6 and NOPM=2 (few methods), WMC=11 (moderate complexity) and NOF=1 (few fields). LCOM=0.5 shows only moderate lack of cohesion but not a strong sign of multiple unrelated responsibilities. There are many named dependencies (15), but in isolation the class-level size/complexity metrics are modest and do not justify declaring Insufficient Modularization."
