    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PathNormalization",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (9 public) and 86 LOC with WMC=12, indicating moderate complexity and substantial behavior surface. LCOM=0.7 shows low cohesion among methods, and there is only 1 field (nof=1) which suggests methods are not tightly centered on shared state. The combination of many public methods, moderate complexity, and low cohesion indicates the class likely groups multiple responsibilities and would benefit from further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
