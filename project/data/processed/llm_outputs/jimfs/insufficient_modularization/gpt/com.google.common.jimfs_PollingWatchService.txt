    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: the class has moderate size (loc=147) and moderate complexity (wmc=17) with 11 methods (nom=11) and 11 fields (nof=11), but very high cohesion (lcom=0.0). Depth of inheritance is shallow (dit=1) and there are no fan-in/fan-out concerns (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the high cohesion and only moderate size/complexity, there is no strong evidence this class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
