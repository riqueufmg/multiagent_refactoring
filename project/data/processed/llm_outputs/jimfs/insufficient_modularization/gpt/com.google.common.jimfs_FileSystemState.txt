    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemState",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: size is moderate (LOC = 91) with a small number of methods (nom = 7, nopm = 6) and few fields (nof = 5); complexity is not excessive (WMC = 13); cohesion is high (LCOM = 0.0); coupling is low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and it has a single external dependency (com.google.common.jimfs.FileTimeSource). These metrics suggest the class is cohesive and not large/complex enough to require further decomposition."
