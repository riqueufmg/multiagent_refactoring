    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.WatchServiceConfiguration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=41, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOF=3. It has low structural complexity and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, DIT=0). Although LCOM=1.0 could hint at cohesion concerns, the very small size and low method/complexity counts do not justify further decomposition in isolation. The listed dependencies (AbstractWatchService, FileSystemView, PathService) are limited and do not indicate the class performs many unrelated responsibilities."
