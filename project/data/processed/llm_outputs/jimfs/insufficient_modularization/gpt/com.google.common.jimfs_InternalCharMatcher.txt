    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.InternalCharMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=17), few methods (nom=3, nopm=2), low complexity (wmc=3), single field (nof=1), high cohesion (lcom=0.0) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already small and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
