    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate clear insufficient modularization: LOC=67 and WMC=11 (moderate size/complexity), NOM=8 with NOPM=4 (reasonable method count), LCOM=0.5 (moderate cohesion), NOF=7 with NOPF=2 but no extreme data clumping, fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no large coupling visible), DIT=0 and NC=0 (no inheritance complexity). Given these values and the single dependency (com.google.common.jimfs.Util), there is insufficient evidence in isolation to claim the class should be decomposed further."
