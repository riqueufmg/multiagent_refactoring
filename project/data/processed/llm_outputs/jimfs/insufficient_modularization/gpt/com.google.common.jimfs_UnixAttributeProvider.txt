    "justification": "High implementation complexity and low cohesion indicate insufficient modularization: WMC=29 (high complexity concentrated in the class) with LOC=86 and NOM=9 (average complexity per method is high); NOPM=7 (most methods are public, suggesting multiple responsibilities exposed); LCOM=0.7777777777777778 (low cohesion); NOF=4 and DIT=1 (functionality is concentrated in this single class rather than distributed via inheritance). These metrics together suggest the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
