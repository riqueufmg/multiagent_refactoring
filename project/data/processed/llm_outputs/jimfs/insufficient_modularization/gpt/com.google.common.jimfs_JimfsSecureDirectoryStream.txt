    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsSecureDirectoryStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: 15 methods (nom = 15) with 12 public (nopm = 12) exposes a large API surface; size and complexity are significant (loc = 119, wmc = 18); it holds 7 fields (nof = 7) suggesting notable internal state. The high number of public methods combined with elevated WMC and LOC suggests the class is handling multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. The class also depends on multiple types (Options, File, FileSystemState, JimfsPath, FileSystemView), reinforcing the potential benefit of clearer modular boundaries."
