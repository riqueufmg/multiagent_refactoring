    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.BasicAttributeProvider.View",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 26 lines of code (loc=26). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT of 1 shows it's at the root of the inheritance hierarchy. With minimal functionality and low complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed for its current role."
