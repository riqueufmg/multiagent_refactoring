{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemState",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods (6 private) and 5 fields, totaling 91 lines of code. The WMC of 13 indicates reasonable method complexity. With 6 private methods out of 7 total methods, the class appears to have good internal encapsulation. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion among the methods and attributes. The class size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
