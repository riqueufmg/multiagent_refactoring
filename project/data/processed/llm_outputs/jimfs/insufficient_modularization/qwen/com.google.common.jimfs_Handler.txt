    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Handler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 44 lines of code (loc=44), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to have a simple structure. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.8) suggest the class is not overly complex and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
