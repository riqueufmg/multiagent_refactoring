    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.OwnerAttributeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a reasonable size (66 LOC, 7 methods) and low complexity (WMC=12). The LCOM value of 1.0 indicates good cohesion, and the depth of inheritance (DIT=1) is minimal. The number of fields (2) and methods (7) suggests appropriate encapsulation without excessive responsibilities. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies indicate isolation but not necessarily insufficient modularization."
