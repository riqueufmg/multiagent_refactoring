    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC=23 and LCOM=0.8181818181818182 indicating poor cohesion. It contains 11 methods with 10 private methods, suggesting a large amount of internal functionality that could be decomposed. The LOC=142 indicates substantial size that could benefit from modularization. The class has no inheritance (DIT=1) but high internal complexity, showing insufficient decomposition of responsibilities."
