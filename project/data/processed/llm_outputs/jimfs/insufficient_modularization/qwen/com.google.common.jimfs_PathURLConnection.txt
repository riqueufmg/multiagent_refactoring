    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (76 loc) and complexity (WMC=10) for its number of methods (6 total, 4 public). The low LCOM value (0.33) indicates good cohesion among methods. With only 4 fields and no dependencies, this suggests appropriate modularization for a URL connection implementation."
