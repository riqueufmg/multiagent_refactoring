{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PathNormalization",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) with 9 being public (nopm=9), 86 lines of code (loc=86), and weighted method count of 12 (wmc=12). While the class has a moderate number of methods and lines of code, the LCOM value of 0.7 indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be well-focused on path normalization functionality with appropriate method decomposition. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class maintains reasonable cohesion and decomposition."
