{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileTree",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC=26 and LOC=142, contains 11 methods (NOM=11) with only 3 private methods (NOPM=3), and manages dependencies to 7 other classes indicating high responsibility. The low LCOM=0.0 suggests cohesive behavior but the high method count and complexity metrics indicate insufficient decomposition of responsibilities."
