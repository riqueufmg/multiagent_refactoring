    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.DosAttributeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (110 LOC, 11 methods) with low complexity (WMC=14) and good cohesion (LCOM=0.818). The class appears to be a specialized provider with a clear responsibility for DOS attributes, and its method count and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
