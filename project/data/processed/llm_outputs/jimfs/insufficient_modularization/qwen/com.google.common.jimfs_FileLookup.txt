{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileLookup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 11 lines of code (loc=11), no fields (nof=0), and no dependencies on other classes except for File. The low number of methods and minimal complexity indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
