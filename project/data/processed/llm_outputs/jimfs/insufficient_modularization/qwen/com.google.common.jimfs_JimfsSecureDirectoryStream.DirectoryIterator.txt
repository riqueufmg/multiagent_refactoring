{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsSecureDirectoryStream.DirectoryIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 22 lines of code (loc=22), and weighted method count of 0 (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple nature."
