{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PollingWatchService",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods and 147 lines of code, which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 17, indicating moderate complexity but not excessive. The LCOM value is 0.0, suggesting good cohesion within the class. The DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) is 1, indicating no inheritance complexity. While the class has some dependencies (5), this is not excessive given its functionality as a watch service. The metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately sized and cohesive."
