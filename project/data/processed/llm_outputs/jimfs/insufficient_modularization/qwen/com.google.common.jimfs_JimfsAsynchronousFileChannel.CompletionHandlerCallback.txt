    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 34 lines of code (loc=34), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). While it is a nested class, its size and complexity are minimal with no methods to decompose further, indicating sufficient modularization for its current purpose."
