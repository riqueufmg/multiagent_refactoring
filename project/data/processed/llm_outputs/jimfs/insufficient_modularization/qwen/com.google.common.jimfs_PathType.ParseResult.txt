    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PathType.ParseResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 35 lines of code. The low WMC (0), NOC (0), and DIT (0) values indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or value object with no implementation complexity that would benefit from modularization."
