    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.UnixAttributeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods and WMC of 29, but LCOM of 0.778 indicates good cohesion. With only 86 lines of code and 4 fields, the class size is reasonable. The class appears to be well-focused on Unix attribute provider functionality with appropriate decomposition."
