{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileFactory.SymbolicLinkSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 9 lines of code (loc=9), and no dependencies other than a single import. The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or supplier with insufficient complexity to exhibit insufficient modularization."
