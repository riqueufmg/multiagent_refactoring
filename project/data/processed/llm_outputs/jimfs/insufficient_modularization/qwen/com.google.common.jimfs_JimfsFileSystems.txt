{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystems",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 2 public), low complexity (WMC=11), and reasonable size (78 LOC). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates good cohesion. While the class has dependencies on 15 other classes, this is not excessive given its role as a factory/utility class for file system operations. The metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to have appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
