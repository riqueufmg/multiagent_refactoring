    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.BasicAttributeProvider.Attributes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 fields and 50 lines of code, which is relatively small. It has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and no dependencies, indicating low complexity. The lack of methods and low field count suggests it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
