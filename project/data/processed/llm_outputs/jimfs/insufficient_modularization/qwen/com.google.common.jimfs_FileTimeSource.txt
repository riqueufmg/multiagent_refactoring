    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileTimeSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 10 lines of code (loc=10), indicating it is already well-decomposed and minimal in size and complexity. The lack of fields and methods suggests this is likely an interface or abstract class that properly follows the single responsibility principle."
