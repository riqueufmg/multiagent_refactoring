    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.UserLookupService.JimfsUserPrincipal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 11 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 dependencies. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion, and the absence of methods and fields indicates this is likely a simple data holder or placeholder class that is already sufficiently modularized."
