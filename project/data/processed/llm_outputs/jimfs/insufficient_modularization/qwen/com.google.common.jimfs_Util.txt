    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Util",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7) and 67 lines of code (loc=67), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=12) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. With only 5 fields (nof=5) and high cohesion (lcom=0.857), the class does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed."
