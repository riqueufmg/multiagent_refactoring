    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 3 fields (nof=3), and low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lines of code (loc=41) are minimal. LCOM value of 1.0 indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple configuration class with focused responsibility, showing sufficient modularization for its size and complexity."
