    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (66 LOC) and complexity (WMC=12), with 8 methods and 4 fields. While it has some dependencies on RegularFile and FileSystemState, the metrics do not indicate excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to have a coherent responsibility as an OutputStream implementation."
