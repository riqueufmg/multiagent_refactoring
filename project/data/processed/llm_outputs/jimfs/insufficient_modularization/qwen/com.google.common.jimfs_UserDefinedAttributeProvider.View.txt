    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.UserDefinedAttributeProvider.View",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 38 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT of 1 shows it's at the root of inheritance hierarchy. While the class exists, its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, well-contained class."
