    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.File",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 34 methods (nom) and 226 lines of code (loc), indicating high size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc) is 42, which is high. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests poor interaction with other components, and the low LCOM value (0.382) indicates weak cohesion among methods, all of which are indicators of insufficient modularization where the class could benefit from further decomposition."
