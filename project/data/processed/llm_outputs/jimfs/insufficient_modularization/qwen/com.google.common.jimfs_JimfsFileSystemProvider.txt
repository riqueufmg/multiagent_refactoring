{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystemProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 32 methods (nom=32) with 26 public methods (nopm=26), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 38 (wmc=38), suggesting high complexity. With 192 lines of code (loc=192) and only 2 fields (nof=2), this class appears to be doing too much work and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The low LCOM value (0.1875) suggests some cohesion, but the overall size and method count indicate insufficient modularization."
