    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystem",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 22 methods (nom) with 20 private methods (nopm), indicating good encapsulation. The WMC of 24 suggests manageable complexity. LCOM of 0.0909090909090909 indicates high cohesion among methods. The class has reasonable size (129 LOC) and method count, with 8 fields (nof) which is acceptable. The metrics do not indicate excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
