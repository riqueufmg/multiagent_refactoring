    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 11 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 dependencies. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or marker class with no implementation complexity that would benefit from modularization."
