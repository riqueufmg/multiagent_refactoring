    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.UserLookupService",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5 total, 3 public), low lines of code (71), low weighted method count (6), and no class dependencies. The size and complexity are within reasonable limits for a single class, and there is no indication that further decomposition would provide significant benefits."
