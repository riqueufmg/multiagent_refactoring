    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileStore",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 28 methods with 181 lines of code, which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) equals the number of methods indicating simple method complexity. LCOM value of 0.1785714285714285 suggests good cohesion within the class. The class has no public fields (nopf=0) and reasonable number of fields (nof=8). While the class has dependencies on 13 other classes, this is not excessive and represents normal collaboration patterns. The metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to have appropriate size and complexity for its responsibilities."
