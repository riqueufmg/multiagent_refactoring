    "justification": "The class has moderate size (97 LOC, 8 methods) with reasonable complexity (WMC=18). The LCOM value of 0.375 indicates good cohesion, and the low number of fields (5) and methods (8) suggests appropriate modularization without excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
