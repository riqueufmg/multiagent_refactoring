    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Java8Compatibility",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2), 0 fields (nof=0), and 10 lines of code (loc=10). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal complexity and size. LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple utility class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
