{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PathType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 19 methods and 166 lines of code, but the WMC of 22 is reasonable. The LCOM value of 0.4210526315789473 indicates good cohesion. The class has only 3 nested classes and no fan-in or fan-out dependencies, suggesting it is well-contained. While it has some implementation complexity, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization to warrant further decomposition."
