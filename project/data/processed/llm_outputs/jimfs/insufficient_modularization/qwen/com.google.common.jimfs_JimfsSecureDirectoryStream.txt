{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsSecureDirectoryStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 15 methods and WMC of 18, but the LCOM value of 0.133 indicates good cohesion. With only 119 lines of code and 7 fields, the class size is reasonable. The method-to-field ratio (15 methods to 7 fields) suggests appropriate functionality distribution. No clear indication of incomplete decomposition or excessive complexity that would warrant further modularization."
