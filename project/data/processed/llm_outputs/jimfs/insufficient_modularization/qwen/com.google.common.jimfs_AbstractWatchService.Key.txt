    "justification": "The class has only 8 fields (nof=8) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 77 lines of code (loc=77). While the class has some fields, the low method count and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data structure or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
