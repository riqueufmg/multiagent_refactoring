{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.SystemJimfsFileSystemProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 25 methods (nom=25) with 22 public methods (nopm=22), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=27) is high, suggesting significant implementation complexity. The Lines of Code (loc=135) further supports the complexity. The LCOM value of 0.72 indicates poor cohesion among methods, suggesting that the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more cohesive units to reduce size and implementation complexity."
