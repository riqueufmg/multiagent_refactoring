    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) with 7 private methods (nopm=7), indicating reasonable encapsulation. The weighted method count (wmc=20) suggests moderate complexity but not excessive. With only 103 lines of code (loc=103) and 4 fields (nof=4), the class maintains a manageable size. The lack of class dependencies (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) and zero lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0) indicate good modularization and focused responsibility."
