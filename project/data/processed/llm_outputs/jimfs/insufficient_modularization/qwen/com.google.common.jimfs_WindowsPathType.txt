    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.WindowsPathType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods (4 public) and WMC of 33, which is manageable. The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates reasonable cohesion. With only 139 lines of code and 5 fields, the class size is reasonable. The DIT of 1 shows it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy. While some further decomposition could be possible, the current level of modularization appears sufficient given the class's complexity and size metrics."
