    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.DowngradedSeekableByteChannel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) and 36 lines of code (loc=36), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=9) is low, suggesting low complexity. With 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains good encapsulation. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low LCOM value (0.0) indicate good cohesion and minimal external coupling. These metrics suggest the class is sufficiently modularized."
