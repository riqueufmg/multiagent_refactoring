    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 1 line of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 weighted method count. The lack of methods and fields indicates it is already highly decomposed or serves as a simple data holder. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class does not contain complex functionality that could be further decomposed."
