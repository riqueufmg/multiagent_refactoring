{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PathService",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 22 methods (nom), 31 weighted method count (wmc), and 191 lines of code (loc). It also has a high number of fields (13 nof) with only 0 public fields, indicating tight internal coupling. The low LCOM value (0.136) suggests cohesive behavior, but the overall size and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition could reduce implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
