{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 344 lines of code (loc), 39 fields (nof), 8 methods (nom) with a weighted method count (wmc) of 18, indicating high complexity and size. The class also has 8 dependencies on inner classes and other types, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The high number of fields and methods, combined with substantial lines of code, indicates insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
