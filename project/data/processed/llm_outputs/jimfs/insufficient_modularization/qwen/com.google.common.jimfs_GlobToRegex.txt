{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.GlobToRegex",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 38 methods (nom=38) and 62 weighted method count (wmc=62), contains 330 lines of code (loc=330), and has 13 fields (nof=13). The high number of methods and lines of code indicates the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The low LCOM value (0.1842105263157894) suggests cohesive behavior, but the overall size and method count still indicate insufficient modularization."
