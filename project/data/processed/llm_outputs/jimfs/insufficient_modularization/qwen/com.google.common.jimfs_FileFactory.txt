{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (88 LOC, 10 methods) and low complexity (WMC=10). The LCOM value of 0.3 indicates good cohesion within the class. The number of fields (6) and methods (10) are within acceptable ranges for a factory class that creates different file types. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies suggest it's not heavily coupled. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its purpose as a factory class."
