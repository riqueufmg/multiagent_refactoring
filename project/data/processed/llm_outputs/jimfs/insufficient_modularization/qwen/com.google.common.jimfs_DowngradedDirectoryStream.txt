    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.DowngradedDirectoryStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 1 field (nof=1), and 16 lines of code (loc=16). The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, indicating low complexity. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure suggest this class is already well-modularized and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
