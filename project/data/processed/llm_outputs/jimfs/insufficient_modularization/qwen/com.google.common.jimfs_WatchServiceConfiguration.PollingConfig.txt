    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.WatchServiceConfiguration.PollingConfig",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 18 lines of code (loc=18), and no method complexity (wmc=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration object that is already sufficiently decomposed. No further decomposition would provide meaningful benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity."
