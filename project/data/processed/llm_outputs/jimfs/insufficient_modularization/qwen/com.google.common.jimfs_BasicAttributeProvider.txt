    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.BasicAttributeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods and WMC of 26, but LCOM value of 1.0 indicates good cohesion. The class size (129 LOC) is reasonable and the method count suggests appropriate decomposition. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies indicate it's not heavily coupled, and the low number of fields (2) suggests focused responsibility."
