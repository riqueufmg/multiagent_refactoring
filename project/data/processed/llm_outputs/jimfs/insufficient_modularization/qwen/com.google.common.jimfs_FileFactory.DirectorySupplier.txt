    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 complexity metrics. The class appears to be a simple data class or supplier implementation that is already sufficiently decomposed. There is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
