    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.StandardAttributeProviders",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 19 lines of code (loc=19) and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=1, nc=0) and simple structure indicates it is already well modularized. The class appears to be a small utility or provider class with minimal complexity that does not require further decomposition."
