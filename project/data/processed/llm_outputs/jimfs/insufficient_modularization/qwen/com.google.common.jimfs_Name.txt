    "justification": "The class has moderate size (67 LOC, 8 methods) and complexity (WMC=11) with reasonable method distribution (7 fields with 2 public, 8 methods with 4 public). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates good cohesion, and there are minimal dependencies (only 1 dependency on Util class). The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
