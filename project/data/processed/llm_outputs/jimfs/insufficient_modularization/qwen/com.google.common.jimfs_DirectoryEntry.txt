{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.DirectoryEntry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) and 107 lines of code (loc=107), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=18) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. With only 4 fields (nof=4) and 12 public methods (nopm=12), the class appears to have a focused responsibility. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it is not overly complex in terms of dependencies. While there are 3 dependencies on related classes (Name, File, Directory), this is expected for a directory entry implementation and represents proper modularization rather than insufficient decomposition."
