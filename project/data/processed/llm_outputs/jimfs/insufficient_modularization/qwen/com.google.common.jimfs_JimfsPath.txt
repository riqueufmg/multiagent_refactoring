{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsPath",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 42 methods (nom=42) with 37 public methods (nopm=37), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The weighted method count (wmc=71) suggests high implementation complexity. With 279 lines of code (loc=279) and only 3 fields (nof=3), the class is doing too much work with insufficient decomposition. The low LCOM value (0.0952380952380952) indicates methods are not cohesive, suggesting the class could benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
