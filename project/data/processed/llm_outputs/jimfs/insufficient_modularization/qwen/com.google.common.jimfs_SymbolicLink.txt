    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.SymbolicLink",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) with low complexity (wmc=4), contains just 26 lines of code (loc=26), has only 1 field (nof=1), and shows no signs of high complexity or large size that would indicate insufficient modularization. The low LCOM value (0.0) suggests good cohesion, and the simple dependency structure with only 2 external dependencies indicates proper modularization."
