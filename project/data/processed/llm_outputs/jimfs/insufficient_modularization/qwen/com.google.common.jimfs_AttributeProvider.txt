{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.AttributeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) with 12 public methods (nopm=12), 101 lines of code (loc=101), and weighted method count of 18 (wmc=18). While the class has moderate complexity, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would clearly warrant further decomposition. The class appears to have reasonable cohesion with 8 nested classes (nc=8) that likely represent related functionality. Without additional context about the specific responsibilities and method implementations, the current level of modularization seems adequate."
