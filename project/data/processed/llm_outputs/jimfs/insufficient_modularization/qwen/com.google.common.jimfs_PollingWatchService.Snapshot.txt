    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PollingWatchService.Snapshot",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 44 lines of code, and no dependencies. The metrics indicate a very simple data structure rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. LCOM of -1.0 suggests good cohesion, and the absence of methods indicates this is likely a simple data container rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
