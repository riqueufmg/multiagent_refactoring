    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.RegularFile",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 43 methods with a weighted method count (WMC) of 81, indicating high complexity. The lines of code (LOC) is 467 which is substantial for a single class. The lack of inheritance (DIT=1) and zero fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggest this class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. The high method count and complexity metrics indicate insufficient modularization."
