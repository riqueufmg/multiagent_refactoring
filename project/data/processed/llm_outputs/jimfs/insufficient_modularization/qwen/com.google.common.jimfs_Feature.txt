    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Feature",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 17 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). It likely represents a simple enum or data class that does not require further decomposition. The absence of methods and minimal size indicates sufficient modularization for its intended purpose."
