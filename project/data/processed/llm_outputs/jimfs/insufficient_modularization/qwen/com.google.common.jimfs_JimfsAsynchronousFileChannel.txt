    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsAsynchronousFileChannel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18) with 16 private methods (nopm=16), indicating a reasonable level of decomposition. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 23, which is moderate. With only 5 fields (nof=5) and 141 lines of code (loc=141), the class size is manageable. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the low number of dependencies (2) suggests reasonable modularization. While there could be potential for further decomposition, the current modularization appears sufficient given the class size and complexity metrics."
