    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.AbstractWatchService",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 11 methods and 187 lines of code, WMC of 15 which is acceptable, and LCOM of 0.1818181818181818 indicating good cohesion. The class has only 14 fields which is manageable, and the absence of fan-in and fan-out dependencies suggests it's not overly coupled. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
