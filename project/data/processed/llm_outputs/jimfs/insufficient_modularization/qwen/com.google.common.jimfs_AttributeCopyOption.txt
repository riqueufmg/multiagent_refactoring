    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 14 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 dependencies. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or enum-like structure with insufficient complexity to exhibit insufficient modularization smell."
