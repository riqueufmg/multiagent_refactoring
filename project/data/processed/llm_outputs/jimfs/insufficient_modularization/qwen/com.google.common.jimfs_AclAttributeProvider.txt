    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.AclAttributeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods (nom=9) and 14 weighted method count (wmc=14), which is within acceptable limits for a single class. The lines of code (loc=79) is relatively small. The class has low coupling with no fan-in or fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and good cohesion as indicated by the LCOM value of 0.778 which is close to 1. The class also has a simple depth of inheritance (dit=1) and no direct dependencies on other classes, suggesting it is already well modularized."
