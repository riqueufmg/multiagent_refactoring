    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.AbstractAttributeView",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 16 lines of code (loc=16), and a low weighted method count (wmc=2). The lack of fields (nof=1) and parameters (nopf=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity. The low number of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple nesting complexity (nc=6) suggest the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
