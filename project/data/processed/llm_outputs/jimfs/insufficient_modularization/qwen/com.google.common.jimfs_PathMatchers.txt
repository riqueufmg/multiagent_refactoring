    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PathMatchers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 1 public method (nopm=1), 40 lines of code (loc=40), and weighted method count of 5 (wmc=5). The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and low LCOM value (0.667) suggest good cohesion. The class appears to be a small utility class with focused responsibility, showing no signs of insufficient modularization."
