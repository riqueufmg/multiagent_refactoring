    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration.Builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 20 fields (nof=20) and 216 lines of code (loc=216), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient decomposition. The high number of fields suggests multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has dependencies on 4 other classes, indicating it may be doing too much coordination work that could be better decomposed."
