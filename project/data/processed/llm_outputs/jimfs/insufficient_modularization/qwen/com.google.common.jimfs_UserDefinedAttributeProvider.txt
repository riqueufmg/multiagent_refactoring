    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) with 8 public methods (nopm=8), WMC of 14 indicating moderate complexity, and 96 lines of code (loc=96). While the class has some complexity, it is reasonably sized and does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization. The class appears to have a focused responsibility with manageable complexity for its size."
