{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Directory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 26 methods (nom), 49 weighted methods (wmc), 267 lines of code (loc), and 8 fields (nof). The high number of methods and lines of code suggests the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The low LCOM value (0.115) indicates good cohesion, but the overall size and method count still suggest insufficient modularization."
