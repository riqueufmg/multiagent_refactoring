    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited to 2 inner types (AbstractWatchService.State, AbstractWatchService.Key). Incoming dependencies come from 3 classes (WatchServiceConfiguration, JimfsPath, AbstractWatchService.Key). These counts are small and interactions are primarily with its own inner types and two external clients; although there is a bidirectional link with AbstractWatchService.Key, the overall number of distinct incoming and outgoing dependencies is not large enough to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
