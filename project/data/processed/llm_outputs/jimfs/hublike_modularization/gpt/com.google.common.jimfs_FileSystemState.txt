    "justification": "FileSystemState has a high incoming degree (8 distinct incoming dependents: JimfsFileSystems, JimfsFileStore, FileSystemView, PollingWatchService, JimfsFileChannel, JimfsInputStream, JimfsOutputStream, JimfsSecureDirectoryStream) but a very low outgoing degree (1 outgoing dependency: com.google.common.jimfs.FileTimeSource). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing coupling is minimal, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
