    "justification": "PathMatchers has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.common.jimfs.GlobToRegex, com.google.common.jimfs.PathNormalization) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.common.jimfs.PathService). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows limited incoming and outgoing coupling."
