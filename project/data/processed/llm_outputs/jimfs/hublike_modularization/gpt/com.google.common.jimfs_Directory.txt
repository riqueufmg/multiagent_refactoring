    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Directory has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions: com.google.common.jimfs.DirectoryEntry, com.google.common.jimfs.File, com.google.common.jimfs.Name, and incoming dependencies from 6 distinct abstractions: com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystems, com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileStore, com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemView, com.google.common.jimfs.FileFactory, com.google.common.jimfs.FileTree, and com.google.common.jimfs.DirectoryEntry. It participates in mutual (bidirectional) dependency relationships with DirectoryEntry and File (both appear in Directory's outgoing list and reference Directory in their outgoing/incoming lists), showing Directory is a central connector with many incoming and outgoing links. The combination of multiple incoming sources (6) and multiple outgoing targets (3), including bidirectional ties, indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
