    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization is characterized by an abstraction having many incoming and outgoing dependencies. InternalCharMatcher has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.common.jimfs.GlobToRegex, specifically references to com.google.common.jimfs.GlobToRegex and com.google.common.jimfs.GlobToRegex.State). With only a single incoming link and no outgoing links, it does not meet the 'hub' criteria."
