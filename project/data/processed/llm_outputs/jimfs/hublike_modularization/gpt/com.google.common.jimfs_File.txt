    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.File",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although com.google.common.jimfs.File has a large number of incoming dependencies (20 classes reference it, e.g. JimfsFileStore, FileSystemView, Directory, FileFactory, FileLookup, DirectoryEntry, RegularFile, AttributeService, etc.), it has only a single outgoing dependency (DirectoryEntry). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming AND many outgoing dependencies. Because File's outgoing dependency count is low (1), it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
