    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 4 classes reference Util (Name, JimfsFileChannel, RegularFile, JimfsAsynchronousFileChannel). Outgoing dependencies: none (Util has 0 outgoing dependencies). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many dependencies in both directions (numerous incoming and numerous outgoing). Because Util has no outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the bidirectional 'hub' criterion."
