    "justification": "PathNormalization has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependents (com.google.common.jimfs.PathService and com.google.common.jimfs.PathMatchers). The hub-like modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here outgoing = 0 and incoming is small, so it does not qualify as a hub."
