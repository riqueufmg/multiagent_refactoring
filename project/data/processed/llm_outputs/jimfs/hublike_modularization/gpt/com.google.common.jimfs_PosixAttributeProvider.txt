    "justification": "PosixAttributeProvider has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions (com.google.common.jimfs.FileLookup, com.google.common.jimfs.File, com.google.common.jimfs.BasicAttributeProvider, com.google.common.jimfs.UserLookupService) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies means this class does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
