    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has only a single incoming dependency from com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemView (one incoming class). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships with numerous other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
