    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.HeapDisk",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "HeapDisk has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.common.jimfs.RegularFile, com.google.common.jimfs.SystemFileTimeSource, com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration) and is depended on by 4 classes (com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystems, com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileStore, com.google.common.jimfs.RegularFile, com.google.common.jimfs.FileFactory). These amount to 6 unique related abstractions in total (RegularFile appears in both directions). This is a modest number of incoming/outgoing relationships and does not constitute a hub-like modularization (no large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
