    "justification": "PathType has a small set of collaborators: 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.common.jimfs.UnixPathType, com.google.common.jimfs.PathType.ParseResult, com.google.common.jimfs.WindowsPathType) and 4 incoming dependents (com.google.common.jimfs.PathService, com.google.common.jimfs.UnixPathType, com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration, com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration.Builder). The total number of unique related abstractions is six and includes inner/closely related types (ParseResult, Configuration.Builder). Although there is a bidirectional reference with UnixPathType, the counts are low and do not indicate a hub-like concentration of many incoming and outgoing dependencies."
