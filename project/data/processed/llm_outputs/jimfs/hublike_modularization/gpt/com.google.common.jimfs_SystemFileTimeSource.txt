    "justification": "SystemFileTimeSource has no outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing list) and only 3 incoming dependencies (HeapDisk, Configuration, Configuration.Builder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the absence of outgoing links and the small number of incoming links do not meet this criterion."
