    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.SymbolicLink",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SymbolicLink has outgoing dependencies to only 2 abstractions (com.google.common.jimfs.File and com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsPath) and is referenced by 3 incoming abstractions (com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemView, com.google.common.jimfs.FileFactory, com.google.common.jimfs.FileTree). These counts are small and do not show the large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. While JimfsPath (one outgoing target) itself depends on several other types, that reflects the targets' internal dependencies rather than many direct connections to SymbolicLink."
