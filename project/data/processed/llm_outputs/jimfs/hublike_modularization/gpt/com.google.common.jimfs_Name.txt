    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Name",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although com.google.common.jimfs.Name has many incoming dependencies (9 distinct classes depend on it: JimfsFileSystems, JimfsFileStore, FileSystemView, PathService, JimfsPath, Directory, FileFactory, FileTree, DirectoryEntry), it has only a single outgoing dependency (com.google.common.jimfs.Util). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing ties; the outgoing degree here (1) is not a large number, so the class does not qualify as a hub."
