    "justification": "Not detected: UnixAttributeProvider has outgoing dependencies to 3 types (com.google.common.jimfs.FileLookup, com.google.common.jimfs.File, com.google.common.jimfs.UnixFileAttributeView) but has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; the absence of incoming dependencies means this class is not a hub."
