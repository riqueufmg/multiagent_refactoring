    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.common.jimfs.PathType). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided counts are low and do not meet that criterion."
