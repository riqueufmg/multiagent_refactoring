    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 0 (no outgoing dependencies). Incoming dependencies: 4 classes (FileSystemState, FileFactory, Configuration, Configuration.Builder) reference this class. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. FileTimeSource has only incoming references and no outgoing dependencies, and the number of incoming clients (4) is not especially large here, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
