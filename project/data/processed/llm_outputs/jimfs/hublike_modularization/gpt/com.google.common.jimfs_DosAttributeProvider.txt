    "justification": "DosAttributeProvider has outgoing dependencies to three abstractions (com.google.common.jimfs.FileLookup, com.google.common.jimfs.File, com.google.common.jimfs.BasicAttributeProvider) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; since there are no incoming dependencies, DosAttributeProvider is not a hub."
