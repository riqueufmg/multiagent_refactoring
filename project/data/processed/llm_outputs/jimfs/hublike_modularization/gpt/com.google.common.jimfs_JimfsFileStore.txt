    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileStore",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JimfsFileStore has 13 outgoing dependencies (FileLookup, AttributeService, Name, DirectoryEntry, HeapDisk, FileTree, AttributeCopyOption, FileFactory, FileSystemState, Feature, Directory, File, JimfsPath) but only 3 incoming dependents (JimfsFileSystems, FileSystemView, JimfsFileSystem). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have large numbers of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here the incoming coupling is small, so JimfsFileStore does not meet the hub-like criterion."
