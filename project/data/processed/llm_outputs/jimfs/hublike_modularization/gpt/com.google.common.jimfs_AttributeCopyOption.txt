    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AttributeCopyOption has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only three incoming dependents (JimfsFileStore, FileSystemView, AttributeService). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. While the incoming classes reference many other types, AttributeCopyOption itself does not have outgoing links and has a small number of incoming references, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
