    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PollingWatchService has outgoing dependencies to 5 classes: PathService, PollingWatchService.Snapshot, FileSystemState, FileSystemView, and JimfsPath (as listed in analyzed_package.dependencies and outgoing_dependencies). However, it has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the lack of incoming dependencies means this class is not a hub."
