    "justification": "PathService has numerous outgoing dependencies (6): Name, PathMatchers, Configuration, PathNormalization, JimfsPath, PathType; and numerous incoming dependencies (6): JimfsFileSystems, FileSystemView, JimfsFileSystem, PollingWatchService, WatchServiceConfiguration, JimfsPath. The class is both depended on by many other abstractions and depends on many others itself (including a bidirectional coupling with JimfsPath), indicating it functions as a central hub and therefore exhibits the Hub-like Modularization smell."
