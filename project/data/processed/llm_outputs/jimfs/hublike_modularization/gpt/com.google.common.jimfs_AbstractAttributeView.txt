    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. AbstractAttributeView has 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.common.jimfs.FileLookup, com.google.common.jimfs.File) and 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies, it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
