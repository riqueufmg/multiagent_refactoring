    "justification": "GlobToRegex has a small number of connections: 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.common.jimfs.GlobToRegex.State, com.google.common.jimfs.InternalCharMatcher) and 1 incoming dependency (com.google.common.jimfs.PathMatchers). With only three distinct related abstractions and limited, local ties (including an inner State), this does not constitute a hub-like modularization."
