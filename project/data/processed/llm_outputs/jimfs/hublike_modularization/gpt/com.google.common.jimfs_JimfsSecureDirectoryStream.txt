    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JimfsSecureDirectoryStream has a small number of outgoing dependencies (5: com.google.common.jimfs.Options, com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemState, com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemView, com.google.common.jimfs.File, com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsPath) and only a single incoming dependency (from com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemView). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; the provided data shows neither high incoming degree nor a large combined connectivity for this class, so the smell is not detected."
