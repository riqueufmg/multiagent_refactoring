    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.DirectoryEntry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "DirectoryEntry has both numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies: incoming from 5 distinct classes (JimfsFileStore, FileSystemView, File, Directory, FileTree) and outgoing to 3 distinct classes (Directory, File, Name). Because it is referenced by multiple core components (e.g., JimfsFileStore, FileSystemView, FileTree) while itself depending on several other abstractions, it functions as a hub connecting many parts of the module, indicating Hub-like Modularization."
