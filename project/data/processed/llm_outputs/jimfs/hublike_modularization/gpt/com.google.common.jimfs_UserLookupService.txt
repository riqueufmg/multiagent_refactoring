    "justification": "UserLookupService has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (from com.google.common.jimfs.OwnerAttributeProvider and com.google.common.jimfs.PosixAttributeProvider). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; this class lacks outgoing dependencies and has only a small number of incoming dependents, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
