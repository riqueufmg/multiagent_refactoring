    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FileFactory has outgoing dependencies to 8 classes (Name, HeapDisk, RegularFile, FileTimeSource, Directory, File, JimfsPath, SymbolicLink). It is referenced by only 2 classes in the provided incoming list (JimfsFileSystems, JimfsFileStore). Hub-like modularization requires a class to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing connections; here the outgoing degree (8) is moderate while the incoming degree (2) is low. The fact that some of the outgoing or incoming classes themselves depend on many others does not by itself make FileFactory a hub. Therefore, based on the provided dependency data, FileFactory is not a hub."
