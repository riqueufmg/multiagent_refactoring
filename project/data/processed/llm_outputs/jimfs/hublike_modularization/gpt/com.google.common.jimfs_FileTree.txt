    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileTree",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FileTree has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes (Options, Name, DirectoryEntry, Directory, File, JimfsPath, SymbolicLink) but only a single incoming dependent (com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileStore). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here the incoming dependency count is low (1) while outgoing is moderate (7), so there is no evidence that FileTree functions as a hub."
