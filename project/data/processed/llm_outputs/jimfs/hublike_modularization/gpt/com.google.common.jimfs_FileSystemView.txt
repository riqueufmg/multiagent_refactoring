    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemView",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "FileSystemView has a large number of outgoing dependencies (16) including: FileLookup, Options, PathService, Name, JimfsFileStore, Feature, DirectoryEntry, JimfsSecureDirectoryStream, FileSystemView.DeleteMode, RegularFile, FileSystemState, AttributeCopyOption, Directory, File, JimfsPath, SymbolicLink. It also has multiple incoming dependencies (6) from core components: JimfsFileSystems, JimfsFileSystem, PollingWatchService, WatchServiceConfiguration, JimfsFileSystemProvider, and JimfsSecureDirectoryStream. The combination of many incoming and many outgoing links to diverse abstractions (paths, files, directories, filesystem state, secure streams, providers, watch services) matches the Hub-like Modularization smell: this class is a central hub with widespread coupling to many other classes."
