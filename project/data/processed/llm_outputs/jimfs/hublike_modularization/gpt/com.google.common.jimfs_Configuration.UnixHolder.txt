    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration) and only one incoming dependency (com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here the UnixHolder is connected to a single other class, so it is not a hub."
