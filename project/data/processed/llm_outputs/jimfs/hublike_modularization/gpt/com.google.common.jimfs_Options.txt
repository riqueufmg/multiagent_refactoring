    "justification": "Options is referenced by 5 other classes (FileSystemView, JimfsPath, JimfsFileSystemProvider, FileTree, JimfsSecureDirectoryStream) but has 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing dependency count is zero, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
