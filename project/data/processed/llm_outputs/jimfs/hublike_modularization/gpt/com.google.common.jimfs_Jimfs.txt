    "justification": "Jimfs has a small number of outgoing dependencies (4): com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystems, com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystemProvider, com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystem, com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration. It has a single incoming dependency shown (1) from com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystems. Because hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections, the provided data (outgoing=4, incoming=1) does not indicate a hub-like structure."
