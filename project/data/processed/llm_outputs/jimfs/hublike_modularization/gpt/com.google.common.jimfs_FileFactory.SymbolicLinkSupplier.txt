    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsPath) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 1, so it does not meet the hub criteria. (Although JimfsPath itself depends on several classes, that is a dependency of the single outgoing target and does not increase this class's incoming/outgoing counts.)"
