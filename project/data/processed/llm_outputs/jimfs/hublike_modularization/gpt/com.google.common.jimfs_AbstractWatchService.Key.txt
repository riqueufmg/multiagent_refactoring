    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.common.jimfs.AbstractWatchService) and only one incoming dependency (from com.google.common.jimfs.AbstractWatchService). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here the interaction is limited to a single other class, so the smell is not present."
