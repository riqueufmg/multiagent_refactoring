    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Feature",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependents (com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileStore and com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemView). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing links; here outgoing count = 0 and incoming count is low, so the smell is not present. Note: the incoming classes themselves depend on many types, but that does not make Feature a hub since Feature lacks broad outgoing dependencies and only has two direct dependents."
