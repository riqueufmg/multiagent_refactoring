    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystemProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 3 classes (JimfsFileSystems, JimfsFileSystem, Jimfs). Outgoing dependencies: 6 classes (JimfsFileChannel, Options, RegularFile, FileSystemView, JimfsPath, JimfsFileSystem). The counts of incoming (3) and outgoing (6) are modest and do not show a large number of bi-directional links with many distinct abstractions. The outgoing dependencies are cohesive domain collaborators (file channel, path, filesystem, options, file view/regular file) rather than a wide, unrelated fan-out, so the class does not meet the criterion for Hub-like Modularization."
