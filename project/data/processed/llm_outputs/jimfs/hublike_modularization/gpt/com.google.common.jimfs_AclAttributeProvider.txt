    "justification": "AclAttributeProvider has outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (com.google.common.jimfs.FileLookup, com.google.common.jimfs.File) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit that pattern."
