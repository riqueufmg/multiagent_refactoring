    "justification": "OsxHolder has only one outgoing dependency: com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration, and only one incoming dependency: com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of distinct other abstractions. While the Configuration class itself references many types, OsxHolder's direct dependency set contains only a single other abstraction, so it does not qualify as hub-like."
