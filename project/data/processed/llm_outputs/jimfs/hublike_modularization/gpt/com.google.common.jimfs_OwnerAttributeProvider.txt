    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.OwnerAttributeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies (com.google.common.jimfs.FileLookup, com.google.common.jimfs.File, com.google.common.jimfs.UserLookupService). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; OwnerAttributeProvider lacks incoming couplings and has a small number of outgoing couplings, so it is not a hub."
