    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JimfsFileSystems has many outgoing dependencies (15 distinct classes: PathService, AttributeService, JimfsFileStore, Name, Jimfs, JimfsFileSystemProvider, HeapDisk, Configuration, FileFactory, FileSystemState, Directory, FileSystemView, JimfsPath, WatchServiceConfiguration, JimfsFileSystem) but only a single incoming dependency (from com.google.common.jimfs.Jimfs). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because incoming dependencies are not numerous here, this class does not meet the hub-like modularization smell."
