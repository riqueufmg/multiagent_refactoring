    "justification": "JimfsOutputStream is not a hub. It has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.common.jimfs.RegularFile, com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemState). Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; the provided metrics show low fan-in and fan-out for this class. (Noting that RegularFile and FileSystemState themselves depend on other classes does not increase JimfsOutputStream's direct incoming/outgoing counts.)"
