    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.DosAttributeProvider.View",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Both incoming and outgoing dependency lists are empty (no incoming_dependencies, no outgoing_dependencies). The class has zero incoming and zero outgoing dependencies, so it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions and therefore does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
