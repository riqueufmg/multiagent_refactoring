    "detection": true,
    "justification": "JimfsFileSystem has numerous outgoing and incoming ties: outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions (PathService, JimfsFileStore, JimfsFileSystemProvider, FileSystemView, JimfsPath, WatchServiceConfiguration) and incoming references from 4 distinct abstractions (JimfsFileSystems, JimfsPath, Jimfs, JimfsFileSystemProvider). Two dependencies (JimfsPath and JimfsFileSystemProvider) appear on both incoming and outgoing lists (mutual coupling). The incoming class JimfsFileSystems itself depends on many other abstractions (e.g., PathService, AttributeService, JimfsFileStore, Name, JimfsFileSystemProvider, HeapDisk, Configuration, FileFactory, FileSystemState, Directory, FileSystemView, JimfsPath, WatchServiceConfiguration, JimfsFileSystem), showing that JimfsFileSystem sits at the center of a wide network of dependencies. The combination of multiple incoming and outgoing links (6 outgoing, 4 incoming) and mutual couplings indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
