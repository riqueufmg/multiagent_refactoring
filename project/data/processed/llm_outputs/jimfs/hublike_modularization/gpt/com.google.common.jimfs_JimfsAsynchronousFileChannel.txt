    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileChannel, com.google.common.jimfs.Util). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; here there are no incoming dependencies and only a small number of outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
