    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BasicAttributeProvider has 4 incoming dependents (PosixAttributeProvider, PosixAttributeProvider.Attributes, DosAttributeProvider, DosAttributeProvider.Attributes) and 2 outgoing dependencies (FileLookup, File). While it is a shared provider used by multiple classes, the number of incoming (4) and outgoing (2) connections is not large enough to qualify as a hub-like modularization (which requires a high count of both incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
