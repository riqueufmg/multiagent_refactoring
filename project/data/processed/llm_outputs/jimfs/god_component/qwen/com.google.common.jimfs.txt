    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 92 classes with a total of 8457 lines of code. While the package is large, the classes are well-distributed in terms of responsibilities, and no single class dominates the codebase in terms of lines of code or complexity. The largest classes, such as FileSystemView (546 loc, WMC 84) and RegularFile (467 loc, WMC 81), are still within reasonable bounds for their functional scope. The overall structure suggests a well-organized library rather than a God Component."
