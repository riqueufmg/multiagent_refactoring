"justification": "The package com.google.googlejavaformat.java has outgoing dependencies to com.google.googlejavaformat and com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc. Both of these packages have Ce=0 and Ca=1, making them more stable than the current package (which has Ce=2 and Ca=2). Since com.google.googlejavaformat.java only depends on packages that are more stable than itself, it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
