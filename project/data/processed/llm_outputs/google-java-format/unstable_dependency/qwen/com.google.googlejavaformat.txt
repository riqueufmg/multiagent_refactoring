"package": "com.google.googlejavaformat",
"detection": false,
"justification": "Package com.google.googlejavaformat has stability of 1.0 (Ce=0, Ca=1), making it maximally stable. It has no outgoing dependencies, so there are no unstable dependencies to evaluate. The package is only depended upon by com.google.googlejavaformat.java which has lower stability (Ce=2, Ca=2), but this represents a stable dependency from the perspective of com.google.googlejavaformat since it is the more stable package."
