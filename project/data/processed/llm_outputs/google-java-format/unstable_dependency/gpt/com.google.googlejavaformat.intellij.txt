"justification": "com.google.googlejavaformat.intellij has Ce=1 and Ca=0 => instability I = 0/(0+1) = 0 (very unstable). Its sole outgoing dependency is com.google.googlejavaformat.java which has Ce=2 and Ca=2 => instability I = 2/(2+2) = 0.5 (more stable). There are no incoming dependencies to com.google.googlejavaformat.intellij (Ca=0). Because the package depends on a more stable package (0.5 > 0), the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
