"justification": "The analyzed package has Ce=1 and Ca=0 -> instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 1/(0+1) = 1.0 (highly unstable). Its outgoing dependency com.google.googlejavaformat.java has Ce=2 and Ca=2 -> instability I = 2/(2+2) = 0.5 (more stable). Because the package depends on a more stable package (I 1.0 -> I 0.5), it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Incoming dependencies are empty (Ca=0), so there is no evidence of an unstable dependency smell."
