"package": "com.google.googlejavaformat",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has no outgoing dependencies (Ce = 0) and one incoming dependency (Ca = 1). Because Ce = 0 and Ca = 1 its instability I = 0/(0+1) = 0 (maximally stable). The only incoming dependency is from com.google.googlejavaformat.java (Ce = 2, Ca = 2, instability = 2/(2+2) = 0.5). The analyzed package does not depend on any less-stable packages (no outgoing deps), and the dependency direction (com.google.googlejavaformat.java -> com.google.googlejavaformat) is from a less stable package to a more stable one, which conforms to the Stable Dependencies Principle; therefore there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
