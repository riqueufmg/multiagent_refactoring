  "justification": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = [], Ce = 0) and a single incoming dependency (Ca = 1). Its instability I = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 0/(0+1) = 0, indicating maximal stability. Since the package does not depend on any other packages, it cannot depend on less stable packages, so the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
