    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=33, NOM=5, WMC=6 indicate low size and moderate complexity; LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion. No coupling or external usage indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies limited to Main). These metrics do not suggest the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
