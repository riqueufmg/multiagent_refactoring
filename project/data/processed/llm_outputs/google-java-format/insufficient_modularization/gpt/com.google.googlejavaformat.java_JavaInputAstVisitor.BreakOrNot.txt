    "justification": "Not detected: the class is very small and shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized. Metrics: LOC=7, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods, no measured complexity, and no dependencies, so there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
