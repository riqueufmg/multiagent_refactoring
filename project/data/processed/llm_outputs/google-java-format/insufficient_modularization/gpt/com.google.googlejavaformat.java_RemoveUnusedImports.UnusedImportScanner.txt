    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.RemoveUnusedImports.UnusedImportScanner",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a moderate size (loc = 88) while exposing a relatively large number of fields (nof = 6) but no methods (nom = 0) and no calculated complexity (wmc = 0). LCOM is -1.0 (indicating cohesion is not positively demonstrated), and fanin/fanout are 0 (low coupling but also no clear decomposition). The combination of non-trivial size with multiple fields and no methods suggests responsibilities are not cleanly separated and the class can be further decomposed to reduce size/implicit complexity and improve modularization."
