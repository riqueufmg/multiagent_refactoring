    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.GoogleJavaFormatTool",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=23, NOM=3, WMC=3. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a DIT of 0. The low size and low complexity metrics indicate the class is already compact; LCOM=-1.0 does not suggest poor cohesion. Given these values, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
