    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ImportOrderer.ImportsAndIndex",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=8, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), low complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance (dit=0), no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal in size and complexity, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
