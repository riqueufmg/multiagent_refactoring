    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor.CollapseEmptyOrNot",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: very small size (loc = 10), zero methods and fields (nom = 0, nof = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
