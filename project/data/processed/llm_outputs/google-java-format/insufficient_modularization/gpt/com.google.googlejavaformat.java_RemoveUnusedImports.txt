    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.RemoveUnusedImports",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is relatively large and complex (LOC=215, WMC=24, NOM=10) which suggests a concentration of behavior; it declares/uses nested scanners (RemoveUnusedImports.UnusedImportScanner, RemoveUnusedImports.DocTreeScanner) indicating multiple distinct responsibilities bundled together; cohesion is only moderate (LCOM=0.3) and there is no inheritance to distribute behavior (DIT=0). Together these metrics and the presence of inner scanner types indicate the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from extracting responsibilities (e.g., scanner logic) into separate modules to reduce size and complexity."
