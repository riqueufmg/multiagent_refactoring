    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.OpsBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 504) and high implementation complexity (wmc = 89) indicate substantial internal complexity; a large API and behavior surface (nom = 36 methods, nopm = 33 public methods) implies multiple responsibilities exposed; substantial internal state (nof = 14 fields, nopf = 3 public fields) increases class burden. Although lcom = 0.1667 suggests cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high WMC, and many public methods suggests the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split to reduce size and complexity. Dependencies on multiple types (Indent, Input, Doc, Op/CloseOp/OpenOp, Output, FormatterDiagnostic, etc.) further indicate distinct concerns that are candidates for modular extraction."
