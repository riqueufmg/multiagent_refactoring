    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: LOC is small (37), there are no methods (nom=0) and no method parameters (nopm=0), cyclomatic complexity is zero (wmc=0), and there are no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The cohesion metric is not indicating fragmentation (lcom=-1.0) and inheritance depth is zero (dit=0). Given the class-level isolation and these low-size/low-complexity values, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
