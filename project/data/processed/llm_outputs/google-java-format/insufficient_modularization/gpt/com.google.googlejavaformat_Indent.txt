    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Indent",

    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=47, WMC=1, NOM=1, LCOM=0.0. It has low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single dependency (Indent.Const). These metrics indicate low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition (Insufficient Modularization not detected)."
