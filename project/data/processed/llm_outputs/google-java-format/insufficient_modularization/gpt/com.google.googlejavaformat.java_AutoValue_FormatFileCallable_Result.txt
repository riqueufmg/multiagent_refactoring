    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an insufficiently modularized class: small size (LOC=52), modest method count (nom=8, nopm=3), limited field count (nof=4), and moderate complexity (WMC=11) that is not excessive for this size. High cohesion (LCOM=0.0) shows related responsibilities are grouped, and there is no inheritance depth (DIT=0) or external coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). These factors suggest the class is sufficiently decomposed and does not require further modularization."
