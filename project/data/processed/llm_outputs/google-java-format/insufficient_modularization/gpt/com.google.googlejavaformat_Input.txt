    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, large or complex class: LOC=115 (moderate size), NOM=10 and WMC=10 (method count and complexity are modest), NOF=0 (no fields/state to split out), LCOM=-1.0 (indicates high cohesion), DIT=1 and NC=1 (no deep hierarchy or many nested classes). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and listed dependencies are limited to a nested Token type and FormatterDiagnostic. Taken in isolation, these elements do not justify that the class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
