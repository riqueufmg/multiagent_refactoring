    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.AutoOneOf_JavaInputAstVisitor_AnnotationOrModifier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=78, WMC=5, NOM=3, NOF=2. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). Although LCOM=1.0 suggests a potential cohesion concern, the very low method and field counts and low complexity do not provide strong evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
