    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=60, WMC=5, NOM=5, NOF=2, LCOM=0.0. It has a minimal public API (NOPM=1), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only depends on an inner Type. These metrics indicate focused responsibility and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
