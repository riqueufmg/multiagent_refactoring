    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC=60 and NOM=10 are modest, WMC=11 is moderate, and LCOM=0.0 indicates high internal cohesion. The class has a small number of fields (NOF=4, NOPF=1) and few public methods (NOPM=2), suggesting a focused responsibility surface. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and DIT=0, indicating low coupling/complexity with respect to other types in the provided context. Based on these elements, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
