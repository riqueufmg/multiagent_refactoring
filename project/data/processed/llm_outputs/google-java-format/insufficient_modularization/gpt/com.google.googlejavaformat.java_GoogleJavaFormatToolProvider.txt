    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=18, NOM=2, WMC=2, no fields (NOF=0), no nested classes (NC=0), DIT=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion. Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
