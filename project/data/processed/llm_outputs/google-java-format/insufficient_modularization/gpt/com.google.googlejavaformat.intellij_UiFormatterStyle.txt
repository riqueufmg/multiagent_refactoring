    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: loc=19, nom=4, nopm=2, nof=2. Complexity is low (wmc=4) and cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). It has no inheritance (dit=0) and no coupling pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single listed dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaFormatterOptions). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and not a candidate for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
