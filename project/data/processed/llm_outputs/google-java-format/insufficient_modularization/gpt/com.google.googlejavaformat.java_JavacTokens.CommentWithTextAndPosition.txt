    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and self-contained: loc=26 and nof=3 (only three fields). There are no methods (nom=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0), indicating little implementation to decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class has excessive size or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
