    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show strong signs of Insufficient Modularization: nom=14 (moderate number of methods) and nopm=11 but LOC=73 and WMC=14 indicate moderate size/complexity, not excessive. LCOM=0.4285714285714285 shows reasonable cohesion (closer to 0 is cohesive). nof=4 (few fields) and fanin=0/fanout=0 indicate low coupling. Overall metrics point to a moderately sized, cohesive class rather than one that clearly requires further decomposition."
