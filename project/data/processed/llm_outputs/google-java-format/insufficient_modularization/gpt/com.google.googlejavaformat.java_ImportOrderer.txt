    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ImportOrderer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 370) and high implementation complexity (wmc = 54) with many methods (nom = 17) but only a small public API (nopm = 2). The presence of multiple nested/helper types referenced (Import, ImportType, ImportsAndIndex, StringAndIndex) suggests several distinct responsibilities are implemented inside one class. Although LCOM is low (0.1176), the combination of high LOC, high WMC, numerous internal methods, and embedded types indicates the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
