    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=24, NOM=2, NOF=1, WMC=4. Cohesion measure (LCOM=-1.0) indicates cohesive implementation. There is no inheritance complexity (DIT=0, NC=1), no coupling pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one listed dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.Input). These elements do not indicate insufficient modularization or a need to further decompose the class."
