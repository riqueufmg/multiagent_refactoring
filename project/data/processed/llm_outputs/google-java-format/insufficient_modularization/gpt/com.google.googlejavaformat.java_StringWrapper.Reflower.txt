    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.StringWrapper.Reflower",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a non-trivial size (loc = 107) and relatively many fields (nof = 7) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and zero complexity measures (wmc = 0). This combination suggests the class concentrates state and implementation in a single unit (and/or holds mixed responsibilities) without clear behavioral decomposition. Fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 indicate no captured collaboration that would justify the size in isolation. These elements together indicate that further decomposition could reduce the class size and implementation complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is detected."
