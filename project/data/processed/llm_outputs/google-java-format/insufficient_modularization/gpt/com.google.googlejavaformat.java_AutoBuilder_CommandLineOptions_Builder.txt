    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high number of fields (nof=20) and many methods (nom=19, nopm=18) concentrated in a single class, sizable implementation (loc=165) and high complexity (wmc=43). These metrics indicate a large, complex class that could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity even though cohesion is not low (lcom=0.105), the volume and complexity justify refactoring into smaller modules."
