    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.AutoValue_JavaFormatterOptions",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (LOC=80), has a modest number of methods (nom=7) and fields (nof=6), and moderate complexity (WMC=9). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0), inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single listed dependency. These metrics indicate the class is reasonably decomposed and not overly large or complex."
