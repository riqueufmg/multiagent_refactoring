    "justification": "Class has low size and complexity (loc=32, wmc=0), contains no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2), and shows no coupling or dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Given these metrics the class is not large or complex enough to justify further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
