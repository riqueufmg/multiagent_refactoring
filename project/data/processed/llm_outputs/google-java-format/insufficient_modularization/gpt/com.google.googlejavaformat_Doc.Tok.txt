    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=56), very low structural content (nof=2 fields, nom=0 methods), no cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency), and shallow inheritance (dit=1). These values suggest the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
