    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaOutput",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 277) and high implementation complexity (WMC = 63) combined with a sizable API/behavior surface (NOM = 16, NOPM = 13) and a non-trivial amount of state (NOF = 12). It also depends on multiple distinct concerns (dependencies: Replacement, Newlines, Input, CommentsHelper, InputOutput, Formatter), suggesting it handles formatting, replacements, newline handling, comments, and I/O responsibilities. Although LCOM = 0.1875 indicates relatively good cohesion, the class-level size and complexity metrics (LOC and WMC) indicate it likely combines multiple responsibilities that could be split to reduce size and complexity, so further decomposition is warranted."
