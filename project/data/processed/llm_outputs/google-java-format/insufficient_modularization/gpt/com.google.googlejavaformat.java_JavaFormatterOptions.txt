    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaFormatterOptions",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not overly complex: LOC=52, WMC=6, NOM=6 (6 public methods). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only a few dependencies [com.google.googlejavaformat.java.AutoValue_JavaFormatterOptions, com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaFormatterOptions.Style, com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Builder]. Although LCOM=0.6667 indicates a moderate cohesion concern, the overall size and complexity metrics do not suggest the class has not been decomposed enough or would benefit from further modularization in isolation."
