    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: loc=17, nom=3 (nopm=3), wmc=3, lcom=-1.0 indicating high cohesion. It has minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two dependencies (com.google.googlejavaformat.Op, com.google.googlejavaformat.DocBuilder). Depth (dit=1) is shallow and there are no children (nc=0). These metrics show low size and low complexity, providing no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
