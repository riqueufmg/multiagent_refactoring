    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Newlines.LineIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: it has 0 methods (nom=0), a small size (loc=34), low complexity (wmc=0), and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Although it has 4 fields (nof=4), the absence of methods and low LOC indicate a simple/small holder rather than a large, undecomposed class, so further decomposition is not warranted."
