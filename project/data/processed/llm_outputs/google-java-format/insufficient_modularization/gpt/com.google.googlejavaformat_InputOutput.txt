    "justification": "Class does not show insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=86), modest method count (NOM=8, public methods=5) and fields (NOF=4); high cohesion (LCOM=0.0) indicates methods work on common state; complexity is moderate (WMC=15) but not accompanied by many methods or low cohesion that would suggest multiple responsibilities; DIT=0 and fanin/fanout=0 show limited coupling. These elements do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
