    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an oversized or overly complex class: LOC is small (73), there are no methods (nom = 0) and no cyclomatic complexity (WMC = 0), coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only a single dependency. These elements suggest the class is simple and not a candidate for further decomposition, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
