    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (loc = 7), no methods or fields (nom = 0, nopf = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), and no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dependencies = []). These metrics indicate a minimal, focused unit with no internal complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
