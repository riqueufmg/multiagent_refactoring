    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=73, NOM=3, NOF=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Cyclomatic/complexity (WMC=10) is moderate but not excessive given the small method count. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are only to its own nested types. These indicators do not support further decomposition; insufficient modularization is not detected."
