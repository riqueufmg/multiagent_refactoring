    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=14, nof=1 (only one field), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. These metrics indicate there is no evidence of an undecomposed, large, or complex class that would benefit from further modularization."
