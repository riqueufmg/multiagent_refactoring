    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=39, number of fields (nof)=4, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There is no method complexity or high cohesion/size indicators that would suggest further decomposition is needed (LCOM=-1.0 does not show cohesion problems in this context). Therefore, Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
