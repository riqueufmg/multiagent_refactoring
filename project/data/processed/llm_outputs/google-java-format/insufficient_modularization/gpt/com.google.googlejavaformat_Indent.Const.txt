    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=19, no methods (nom=0), only 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=1), and very low complexity (wmc=0). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies, and LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion is not an issue. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
