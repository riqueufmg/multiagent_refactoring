    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows multiple classic indicators of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 375), high implementation complexity (wmc = 81), many fields (nof = 34) and many methods (nom = 18). These values imply the class likely contains multiple responsibilities and sizable implementation blocks that could be decomposed. The presence of related types in its dependencies (CharStream, NestingCounter, Token, and its own LexException) further suggests distinct concerns (stream handling, nesting/counting logic, token representation, error handling) that could be separated into smaller, focused classes or components. Although LCOM = 0.277 indicates some cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high WMC, and large number of fields/methods justifies refactoring into multiple modules/classes to reduce size and complexity."
