    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is trivial and does not show symptoms of insufficient modularization: loc=1, nof=0 (no fields), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. With no size, complexity, or coupling, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
