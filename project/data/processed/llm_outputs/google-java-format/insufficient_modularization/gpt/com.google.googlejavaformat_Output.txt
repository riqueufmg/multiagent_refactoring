    "justification": "LCOM=1.0 indicates low cohesion (methods do not share state). The class has 6 methods (nom=6) but only 1 field (nof=1), suggesting those methods implement multiple, independent responsibilities rather than operating on shared state. Although the file is small (loc=46) and overall complexity is moderate (wmc=6), the combination of multiple methods with high lack-of-cohesion makes the class a candidate for further decomposition. The declared dependencies (com.google.googlejavaformat.Input, com.google.googlejavaformat.CommentsHelper) also suggest mixed responsibilities (handling output related to input and comments) that could be separated. These elements together justify detection of Insufficient Modularization."
