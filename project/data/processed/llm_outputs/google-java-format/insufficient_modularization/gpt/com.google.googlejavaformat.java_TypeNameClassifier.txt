    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.TypeNameClassifier",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LOC=126 with NOM=2 and NOF=1 indicates the class is relatively large while exposing only two methods and one field, implying large, complex methods that could be split. LCOM=1.0 signals low cohesion (methods do not share common state), suggesting multiple responsibilities are mixed. WMC=5 combined with high LOC per method points to concentrated complexity. Presence of an inner dependency (TypeNameClassifier.TyParseState) indicates embedded parsing/state logic that could be extracted. These elements together justify Insufficient Modularization."
