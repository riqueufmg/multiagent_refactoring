    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.CommandLineOptionsParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a moderate size (loc = 127) and a high weighted method complexity (wmc = 34) spread across a small number of methods (nom = 6), indicating large/complex methods that could be split. There is no inheritance decomposition (dit = 0) and only 3 fields (nof = 3), so complexity appears concentrated inside the class rather than distributed. Although LCOM = 0.0 implies cohesion, the combination of high WMC and LOC with few methods suggests the class likely contains multiple responsibilities or large implementation blocks that would benefit from further decomposition or extraction into helper classes/components."
