    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.StringWrapper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: large size (LOC = 328), many fields (NOF = 9) and methods (NOM = 14) combined with high complexity (WMC = 46) indicate it contains substantial implementation and behavioral volume that can be decomposed. Most methods appear to be non-public (NOPM = 1 public method vs 14 total), implying many internal helper responsibilities are bundled in the same class. DIT = 0 (no inheritance-based decomposition) and the low but non-zero cohesion measure (LCOM = 0.1428571428571428) mean that, despite some cohesion, the overall size and complexity justify further decomposition into smaller, focused classes or modules."
