    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no measurable internal complexity or responsibilities: LOC=7, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is minimal and does not exhibit symptoms of insufficient modularization (no large size or high complexity to decompose). LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable) and absence of methods/fields further support no decomposition needed."
