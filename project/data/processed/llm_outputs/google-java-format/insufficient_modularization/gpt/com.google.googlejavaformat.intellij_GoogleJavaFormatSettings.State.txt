    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=22, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, number of fields (nof)=2 (nopf=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion measure (LCOM=-1.0) does not suggest fragmentation. Only one external dependency is listed. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or poor cohesion that would justify further decomposition."
