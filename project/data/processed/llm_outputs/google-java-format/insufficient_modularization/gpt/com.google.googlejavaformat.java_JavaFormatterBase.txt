    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is modest in size and cohesive: loc=90, nom=8, nopm=3, nof=2. LCOM=0.25 shows good cohesion (methods share common state), and fanin=0/fanout=0 indicate low coupling. Although WMC=20 shows some internal complexity, given the small number of methods and low field count, there is insufficient evidence that the class has not been decomposed — the cohesion and size metrics do not justify marking this as Insufficient Modularization.
