    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=9, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPM=0, DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no recorded dependencies and no measurable internal complexity or cohesion issues (LCOM = -1.0 likely not indicating large unmet cohesion). Given the minimal size, zero methods/fields, and zero coupling, there is no evidence in the provided data that the class requires further decomposition."
