    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc.Level",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it has a relatively large size (loc = 151) while containing multiple fields (nof = 5) but no declared methods (nom = 0), which indicates substantial implementation/data concentrated in a single unit. The shallow inheritance (dit = 1) and zero external coupling metrics (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) imply responsibilities are internalized rather than split out. The presence of a dependency on com.google.googlejavaformat.Indent suggests additional responsibility related to indentation handling. Together these elements (high LOC, multiple fields, no methods, internalized dependencies) justify decomposing the class into smaller, more focused units."
