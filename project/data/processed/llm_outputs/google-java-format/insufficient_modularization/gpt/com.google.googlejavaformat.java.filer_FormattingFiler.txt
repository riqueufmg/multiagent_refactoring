    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=49, nom=7, nof=3. Complexity is moderate (wmc=8) and cohesion is good (lcom=0.2857). Low coupling/influence (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (dit=0). These metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition."
