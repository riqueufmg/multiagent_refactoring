    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=12, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0, DIT=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or requires further decomposition."
