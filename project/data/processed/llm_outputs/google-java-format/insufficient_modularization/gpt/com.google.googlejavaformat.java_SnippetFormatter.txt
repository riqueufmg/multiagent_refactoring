    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.SnippetFormatter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 139) and high complexity (wmc = 24) for a single class; moderate number of methods (nom = 8) with half public (nopm = 4) indicating multiple external responsibilities; five fields (nof = 5) increasing state to manage; and the presence of inner-type responsibilities referenced (SnippetFormatter.SnippetKind, SnippetFormatter.SnippetWrapper) suggesting multiple concerns bundled together. These factors indicate the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
