    "justification": "Class is likely insufficiently modularized: very large size (loc=536) and many fields (nof=28) indicate substantial state; relatively few methods (nom=8, nopm=2) and moderate complexity (wmc=8) imply lot of data with limited cohesive behavior; LCOM=1.0 indicates low cohesion among members; presence of many internal concept/dependency names (Doc.RealOrImaginary, Doc.State, Doc.FillMode, Doc.Tok, Doc.Space, Doc.Token, CommentsHelper) suggests multiple responsibilities or sub-concepts that could be extracted into smaller classes; DIT=0 (no inheritance) and high number of fields favor decomposition into focused modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
