    "justification": "High implementation complexity (wmc = 40) combined with a moderate size (loc = 99) and a small set of methods (nom = 8) indicates concentrated, complex behavior in a single class. Only one public method (nopm = 1) with multiple non-public methods suggests internal responsibilities are bundled rather than exposed as smaller modules. The class has several fields (nof = 5) and only moderate cohesion (lcom = 0.25), implying it holds multiple related state/behaviors that could be separated. These metrics together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization for this class."
