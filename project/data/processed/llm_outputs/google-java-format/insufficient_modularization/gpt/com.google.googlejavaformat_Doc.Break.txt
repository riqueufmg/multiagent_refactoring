    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: loc=107 is moderate but nom=0 and wmc=0 show no behavioral complexity, nof=6 is modest, lcom=-1.0 indicates high cohesion, and fanin=0/fanout=0 indicate low coupling. Given the absence of methods/complexity and the high cohesion, there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
