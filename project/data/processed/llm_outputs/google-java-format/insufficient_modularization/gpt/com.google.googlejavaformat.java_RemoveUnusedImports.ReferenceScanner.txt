    "justification": "Metrics show the class is very small and simple: LOC=10, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1, NOPF=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods and minimal state and no dependencies, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
