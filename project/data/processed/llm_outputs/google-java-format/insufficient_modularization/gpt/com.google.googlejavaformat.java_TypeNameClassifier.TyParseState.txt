    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0) and WMC=0 show low behavioral complexity; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling-driven bloat. LOC=70 is modest but without methods or high complexity there is no evidence the class aggregates multiple responsibilities that require decomposition. LCOM is not meaningful here (−1.0) given the lack of methods. Therefore, no smell detected in isolation."
