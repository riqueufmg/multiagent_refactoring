    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC = 20, number of fields = 1, number of methods = 0, WMC = 0. No incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given the low size and zero method/complexity metrics, there is insufficient evidence that this class is a large, undecomposed unit requiring further modularization."
