    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being under-modularized: very small size (loc=27), no methods (nom=0), minimal complexity (wmc=0), a single field (nof=1), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and not a candidate for further decomposition."
