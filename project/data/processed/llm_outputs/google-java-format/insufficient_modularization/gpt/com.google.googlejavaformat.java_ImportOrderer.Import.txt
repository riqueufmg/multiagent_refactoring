    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large or complex class: LOC=77 (moderate size) but NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods / zero complexity), NOF=3 (only three fields), LCOM=-1.0 (cohesive), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling), and no dependencies. Given the absence of methods, zero complexity, low field count and low coupling, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
