    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=16, NOM=3, WMC=3, NOF=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies list length=1) and it has no inheritance depth or children (DIT=0, NC=0). Although LCOM=0.666 indicates moderate cohesion concerns, the overall low size and low complexity do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
