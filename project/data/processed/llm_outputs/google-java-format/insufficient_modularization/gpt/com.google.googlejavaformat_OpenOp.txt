    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=23, NOM=4, WMC=4 and LCOM=0.0. Low size and low complexity (WMC=4) and perfect cohesion (LCOM=0.0) suggest it does not contain multiple responsibilities or excessive implementation to warrant further decomposition. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 and only three dependencies also indicate limited coupling. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
