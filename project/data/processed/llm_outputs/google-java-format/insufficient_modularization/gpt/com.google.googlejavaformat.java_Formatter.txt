    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Formatter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics and structure indicate insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc=128) and complexity (wmc=14) with a relatively large API surface (nom=10, nopm=8) — most methods are public, suggesting multiple responsibilities exposed. Cohesion is not strong (lcom=0.4), and there are few fields (nof=3) so behavior is concentrated in methods rather than cleanly separated state. The class does not rely on inheritance (dit=0), indicating lack of decomposition via subclassing. It also depends on many distinct collaborators (FormatterException, ModifierOrderer, RemoveUnusedImports, Doc, StringWrapper, Newlines, JavaInput, ImportOrderer, JavaInputAstVisitor, JavaOutput, DocBuilder, JavaFormatterOptions, OpsBuilder, Trees), which implies it coordinates multiple concerns (parsing, formatting, import/order handling, output/doc building, options, AST/trees). These factors together support the detection of Insufficient Modularization."
