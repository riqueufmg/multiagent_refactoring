    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: loc=8, nom=1, wmc=1, nof=0 (no fields). Low coupling: fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency listed. DIT=1 and LCOM=-1.0 indicate minimal inheritance depth and no cohesion concerns in the given data. Given the tiny size and low complexity, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or would benefit from further decomposition."
