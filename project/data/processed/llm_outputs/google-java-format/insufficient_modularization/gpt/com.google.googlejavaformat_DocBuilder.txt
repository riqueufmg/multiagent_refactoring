    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=68 and WMC=9 indicate moderate complexity, NOM=8 (NOPM=4) and NOF=3 are modest sizes. LCOM=0.25 shows good cohesion (low likelihood that methods belong to unrelated responsibilities). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, and only two external dependencies are listed, so there is no strong evidence of multiple distinct responsibilities that would justify further decomposition."
