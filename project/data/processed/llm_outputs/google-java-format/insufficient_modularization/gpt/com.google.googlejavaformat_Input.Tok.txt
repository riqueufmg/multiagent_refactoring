    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=52), no methods reported (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. LCOM is not applicable (-1.0). These metrics provide no evidence that the class is too large or insufficiently decomposed."
