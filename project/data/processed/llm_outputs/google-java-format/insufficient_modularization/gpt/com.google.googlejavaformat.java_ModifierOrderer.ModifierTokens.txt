    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ModifierOrderer.ModifierTokens",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no indicators of being insufficiently modular: small size (loc=48), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem here. Given these metrics, there is no evidence this class must be further decomposed."
