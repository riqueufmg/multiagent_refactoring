    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Replacement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=41), low number of fields (nof=2), modest number of methods (nom=6) and public methods (nopm=5), moderate complexity (wmc=8) and good cohesion (lcom=0.333). No inheritance depth (dit=0) or coupling evidence (fanin=0, fanout=0). These values suggest the class is small, cohesive, and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided data."
