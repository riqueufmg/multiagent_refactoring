    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Newlines",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The class has moderate size and complexity (LOC=159, WMC=17), a small number of methods (nom=9) and fields (nof=8). Cohesion is reasonably good (LCOM=0.3333), and there are no external couplings (fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies). These metrics do not indicate a class that clearly needs further decomposition."
