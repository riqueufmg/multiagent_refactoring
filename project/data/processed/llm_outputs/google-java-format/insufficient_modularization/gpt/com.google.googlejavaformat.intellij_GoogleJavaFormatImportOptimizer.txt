    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=43, WMC=7, NOM=2 indicate low size and low complexity; LCOM=-1.0 implies high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show it has no coupling pressure in the provided context. Dependency list is short and focused. Given these metrics the class does not exhibit signs of being insufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition in isolation."
