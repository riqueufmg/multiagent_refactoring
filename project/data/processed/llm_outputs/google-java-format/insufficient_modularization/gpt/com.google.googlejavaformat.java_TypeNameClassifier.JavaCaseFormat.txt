    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=32, WMC=0, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), no package methods (nopm=0), LCOM not indicating cohesion issues, and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence of large size or high complexity that would warrant further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
