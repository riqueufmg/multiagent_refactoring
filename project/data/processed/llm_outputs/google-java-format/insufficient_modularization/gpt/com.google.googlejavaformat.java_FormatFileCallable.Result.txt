    "justification": "Class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc = 12), no methods (nom = 0) and no fields (nof = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). LCOM = -1.0 indicates cohesion measurement not applicable for an empty/trivial class. Given the lack of implementation elements and complexity, there is nothing to decompose further."
