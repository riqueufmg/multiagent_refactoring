    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Main",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 227) and high implementation complexity (WMC = 35) indicate substantial internal logic that can be split. It defines multiple members and behaviors (NOF = 5, NOM = 9, NOPM = 4) while cohesion is only moderate (LCOM = 0.5556), suggesting multiple responsibilities. The class also depends on several distinct concerns (UsageException, FormatFileCallable, JavaFormatterOptions, GoogleJavaFormatVersion, CommandLineOptionsParser), implying it handles parsing/options, formatting, versioning, and error handling in one unit. These elements together justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
