    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=33, NOF=2, NOM=0, NOPM=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies are listed. LCOM=-1.0 does not suggest poor cohesion. Based on these elements, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
