    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=41), small number of methods (nom=6, nopm=3), few fields (nof=2), very high cohesion (lcom=0.0), moderate cyclomatic weight (wmc=10) but not excessive, no inheritance (dit=0) and no external coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0). These elements suggest the class is suitably small and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
