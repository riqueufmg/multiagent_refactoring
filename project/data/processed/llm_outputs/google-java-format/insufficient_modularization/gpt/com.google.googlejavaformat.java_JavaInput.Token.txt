    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=43, nof=3 (only three fields), nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no internal complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is a single external dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.Input). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems for a data-holder. Given its low size, complexity and coupling, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
