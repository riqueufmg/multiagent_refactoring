    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc=165) and non-trivial complexity (wmc=13); high number of fields compared to methods (nof=9 vs nom=3) indicating a data-rich class with few operations; low cohesion (lcom=0.6666666666666666) suggesting multiple responsibilities; contains inner/dependent components (CommentSavingTokenizer, AccessibleScanner) that are likely separate concerns that could be extracted to reduce size and complexity."
