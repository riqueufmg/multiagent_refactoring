    "justification": "LCOM = 0.714 (low cohesion) while nom = 7 (nopm = 6) indicates multiple public methods; wmc = 9 shows moderate internal complexity concentrated in this class; loc = 53 and nof = 3 suggest the class holds several fields and responsibilities in a small-to-medium sized file. fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 indicate it is standalone (no coupling to distribute responsibilities). These elements (high LCOM, several public methods, and non-trivial WMC) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
