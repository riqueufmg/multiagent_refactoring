    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.SnippetFormatter.SnippetWrapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=18, NOF (fields)=2, NOM (methods)=0, WMC=0. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. Given the lack of methods, low size, and zero complexity/coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
