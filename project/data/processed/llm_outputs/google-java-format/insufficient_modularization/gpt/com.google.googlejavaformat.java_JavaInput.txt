    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInput",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 474) and high implementation complexity (wmc = 64). It declares many fields and methods (nof = 19, nom = 23) with a substantial public API surface (nopm = 13), indicating multiple responsibilities that could be split. Although LCOM is low (0.1739) suggesting reasonable cohesion, the absolute size and complexity metrics (loc and wmc) plus the presence of nested types referenced (JavaInput.Tok, JavaInput.Token) support that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
