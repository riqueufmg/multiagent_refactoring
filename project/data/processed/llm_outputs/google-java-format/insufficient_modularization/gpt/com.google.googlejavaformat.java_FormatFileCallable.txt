    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is small (69), number of methods is low (nom=4) with moderate complexity (wmc=11), and cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). The class has a manageable number of fields (nof=4) and no broad coupling shown (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although it depends on several formatter-related types, the size, method count, and high cohesion suggest it is sufficiently decomposed and does not require further modularization."
