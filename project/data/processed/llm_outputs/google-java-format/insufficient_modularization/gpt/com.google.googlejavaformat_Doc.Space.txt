    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=36, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0. It has no coupling or dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=1 and lcom=-1.0 indicate simplicity/cohesion. Given these metrics the class does not show signs of being insufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
