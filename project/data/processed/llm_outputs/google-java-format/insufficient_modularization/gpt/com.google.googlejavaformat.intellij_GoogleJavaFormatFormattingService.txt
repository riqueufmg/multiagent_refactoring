    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High lack of cohesion (LCOM = 0.857) indicates the methods are weakly related and the class likely mixes responsibilities. The class has moderate size and complexity (LOC = 70, WMC = 9) with 7 methods (nom = 7) and 3 fields (nof = 3, nopf = 1), which suggests it encapsulates multiple behaviors that could be separated. The listed dependencies (JreConfigurationChecker, GoogleJavaFormatSettings, Formatter/Builder/JavaFormatterOptions, Notifications) imply the class coordinates configuration, formatting logic, and user notifications — multiple concerns that favor decomposition. Together these metrics and dependencies justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
