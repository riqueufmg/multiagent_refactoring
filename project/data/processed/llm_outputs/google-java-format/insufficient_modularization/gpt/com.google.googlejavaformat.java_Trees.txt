    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Trees",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size and complexity for a single unit (loc=134, nom=14, wmc=20). The number of methods (nom=14) combined with a moderate-to-high weighted method complexity (wmc=20) suggests multiple responsibilities that could be split. The low number of public methods (nopm=2) together with many total methods implies internal helper functionality that could be moved into smaller, focused classes. The cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) indicates poor cohesion within the class. These elements (loc, nom, wmc, nopm, lcom) justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity, indicating Insufficient Modularization."
