    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 127 (relatively large), WMC = 30 (high cyclomatic/implementation complexity), NOM = 7 with NOPM = 2 (only 2 public methods, implying ~5 non-public methods and internal responsibilities that could be split). LCOM = 0.0 shows methods are related to class state but does not mitigate the size/complexity. DIT = 1 and fanin/fanout = 0 indicate low inheritance and low coupling, making it safer to extract responsibilities. Together these values suggest the class holds multiple implementation concerns and could be modularized to reduce size and complexity."
