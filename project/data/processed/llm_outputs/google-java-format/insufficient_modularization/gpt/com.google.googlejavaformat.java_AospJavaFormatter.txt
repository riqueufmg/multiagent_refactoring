    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple, so insufficient modularization is unlikely: LOC=8, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, NOPM=1, DIT=1. Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a low number of members indicate no further decomposition needed. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Only one dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaFormatterOptions) further indicates limited responsibilities."
