    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no members or behavior that could be further decomposed: LOC=13, NOF=0, NOM=0, WMC=0. Coupling metrics show no interactions (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies provided. Given the lack of size, methods, fields, or complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
