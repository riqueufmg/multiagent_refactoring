    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: moderate size (LOC=85) but no methods (NOM=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (WMC=0) indicate limited internal implementation to decompose; high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0) argues against multiple responsibilities; low coupling/dependency surface (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies count=3) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1) further reduce need for decomposition. These metrics do not justify reporting Insufficient Modularization."
