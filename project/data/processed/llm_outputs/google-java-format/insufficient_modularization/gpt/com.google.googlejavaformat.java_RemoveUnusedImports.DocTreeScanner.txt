    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=28, wmc=0. It has minimal state and behavior (nof=1, nom=0, nopf=0) and no coupling or dependencies (fanout=0, fanin=0, dependencies=[]). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modular or requires further decomposition."
