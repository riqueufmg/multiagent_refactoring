    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavacTokens.CommentSavingTokenizer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC is low (34), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods/complexity), only 1 field (NOF = 1), fanin and fanout are 0 and there are no dependencies. These characteristics show the class is small, simple, and not handling multiple responsibilities, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
