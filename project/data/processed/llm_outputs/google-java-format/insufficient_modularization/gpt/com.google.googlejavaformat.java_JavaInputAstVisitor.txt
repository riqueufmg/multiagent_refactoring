    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is oversized and complex: 3,233 LOC and 167 methods (nom) with a very high weighted method count (wmc = 560), indicating heavy implementation complexity. It declares many inner types and role-like enums/classes (e.g. JavaInputAstVisitor.AnnotationOrModifier, DeclarationKind, BracesOrNot, DeclarationModifiersAndTypeAnnotations, AllowLeadingBlankLine, AllowTrailingBlankLine, Direction, BreakOrNot, CollapseEmptyOrNot, Kind, FirstDeclarationsOrNot), which suggests multiple responsibilities that could be split out. There are 17 fields and a large number of methods (nopm = 75 non-public methods), supporting the observation of concentrated behavior inside one class. Although LCOM is low, the combination of very large size, high cyclomatic complexity, many methods, and numerous inner types/dependencies indicates the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization (extracting responsibilities into smaller classes/components)."
