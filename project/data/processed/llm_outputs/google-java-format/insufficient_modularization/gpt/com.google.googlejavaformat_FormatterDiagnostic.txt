    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: LOC=54 (small class size), NOM=7 with NOPM=6 (few methods, most public), WMC=10 (moderate cyclomatic complexity), NOF=3 (few fields), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). Fanin/fanout are 0 (no coupling in provided data). Overall the class is small, cohesive, and of moderate complexity, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
