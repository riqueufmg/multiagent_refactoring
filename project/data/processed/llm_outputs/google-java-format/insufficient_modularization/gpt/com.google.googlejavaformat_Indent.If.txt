    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, simple class: LOC=22, NOF=3, NOM=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, DIT=1. Low lines of code, few fields and no methods, zero measured complexity and no coupling suggest no need for further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
