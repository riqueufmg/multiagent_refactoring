    "justification": "The class is trivial: very small size (loc = 7), no fields or methods (nof = 0, nom = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), and no dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics indicate it is already minimal and there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
