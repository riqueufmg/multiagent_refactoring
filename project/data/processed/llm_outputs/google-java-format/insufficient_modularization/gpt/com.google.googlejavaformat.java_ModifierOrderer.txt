    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ModifierOrderer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has 180 LOC and a high overall complexity (WMC=38) spread over only 7 methods (NOM=7), indicating large and/or complex methods. It has very few fields (NOF=2) but moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.428), suggesting many behaviors are implemented without matching internal state and could be further decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or helper components. These metrics (high LOC and WMC relative to NOM, low NOF, and middling LCOM) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
