    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=40), low complexity (WMC=9), few methods (nom=7) and fields (nof=2). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency), no inheritance (DIT=0), and although cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5714), the class is small enough that further decomposition is not clearly justified."
