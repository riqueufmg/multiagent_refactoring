    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.JavadocWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 247), high implementation complexity (WMC = 50), and a high number of methods (NOM = 36) while exposing very few public methods (NOPM = 1). It also has many fields (NOF = 14) and several internal/nested helper dependencies (e.g. AutoIndent, RequestedWhitespace, NestingCounter, Token, JavadocFormatter) referenced, indicating multiple responsibilities and internal helper logic bundled into a single class. Together these metrics suggest the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
