    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 63 indicates non-trivial size while NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 show no methods or internal behavioral decomposition. NOF = 5 with NOPF = 3 (many public fields) suggests data and responsibility are not encapsulated or split into smaller cohesive units. Fanin/Fanout = 0 and empty dependencies mean the class in isolation holds most of its content rather than delegating, so further decomposition (introducing methods, splitting responsibilities or encapsulating fields) could reduce size and improve modularity."
