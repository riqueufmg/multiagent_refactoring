    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=38, 3 fields, 0 methods, WMC=0, DIT=1, fanin=0, fanout=0. These metrics indicate low size and complexity and no evidence of concentrated responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition. No coupling or method complexity warrants modularization in isolation."
