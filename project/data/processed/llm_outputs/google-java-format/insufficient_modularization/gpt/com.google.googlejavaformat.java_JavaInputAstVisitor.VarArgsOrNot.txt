    "justification": "Metrics indicate a very small, non-complex class: LOC=13, number of methods=0, number of fields=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or many responsibilities that would suggest it needs further decomposition. LCOM is -1.0 (no applicable cohesion data). Based on the provided metrics in isolation, insufficient modularization is not detected."
