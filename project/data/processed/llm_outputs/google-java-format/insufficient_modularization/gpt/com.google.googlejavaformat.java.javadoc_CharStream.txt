    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=35, NOM=5, NOF=2. Complexity is low to moderate: WMC=7 (avg ~1.4 per method). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). There is no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no external coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large, or high-complexity class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
