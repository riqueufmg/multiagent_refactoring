    "justification": "Although small (LOC=50), the class shows signs of insufficient modularization: 7 methods (NOM=7) with only 2 public methods (NOPM=2) and 3 fields (NOF=3) combined with a relatively high weighted method complexity (WMC=10) and low cohesion (LCOM=0.7142857142857143). The LCOM value indicates that methods are not highly related to the same fields, suggesting multiple responsibilities and that further decomposition could reduce implementation complexity and improve cohesion."
