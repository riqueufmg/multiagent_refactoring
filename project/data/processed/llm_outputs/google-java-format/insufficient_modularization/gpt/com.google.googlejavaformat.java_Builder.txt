    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High method count (nom=20) together with high complexity (wmc=20) concentrated in a very small source (loc=28) indicates many responsibilities and implementation complexity packed into a single class. The class appears self-contained (fanin=0, fanout=0), suggesting behavior is centralized rather than delegated. These elements (nom=20, wmc=20, loc=28, fanin=0, fanout=0) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and could benefit from decomposition."
