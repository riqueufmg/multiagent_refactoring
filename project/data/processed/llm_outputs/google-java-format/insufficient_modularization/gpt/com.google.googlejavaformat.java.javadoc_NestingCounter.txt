    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=28, number of methods=6, number of fields=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Complexity is modest (WMC=8) for the small method count. No inheritance (DIT=0) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is not a large, undecomposed unit, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
