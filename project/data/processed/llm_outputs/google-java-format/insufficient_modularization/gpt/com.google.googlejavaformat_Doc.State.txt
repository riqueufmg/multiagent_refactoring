    "justification": "Metrics show no indication of Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=27), few fields (nof=4), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 and lack of methods suggest the class is small and cohesive; there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
