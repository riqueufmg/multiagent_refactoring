      "justification": "Relatively small (loc 53) with 7 methods and moderate complexity (wmc 9). Although lcom is higher (0.714) than its peer, the class remains compact, has minimal coupling (fanin/fanout 0, single dependency on Formatter), and appears focused on file-object formatting responsibilities. The metrics do not indicate an overly large or multi-responsibility class that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
