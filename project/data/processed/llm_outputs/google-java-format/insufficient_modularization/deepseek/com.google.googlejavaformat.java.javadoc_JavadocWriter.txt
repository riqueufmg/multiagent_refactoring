    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.JavadocWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 36 methods (nom=36) and 50 weighted methods per class (wmc=50), indicating many responsibilities. It has 14 fields (nof=14) and 247 lines of code (loc=247), suggesting multiple concerns are combined. The low cohesion (lcom=0.0) may indicate unrelated methods grouped together, and the presence of inner classes (RequestedWhitespace, AutoIndent) suggests decomposition has started but is insufficient."
