    "justification": "The class has 7 methods (nom) with 3 being public (nopm), 3 fields (nof) with 1 being public (nopf), and a high LCOM value of 0.857 indicating low cohesion. The WMC of 9 and LOC of 70 suggest moderate complexity that could be reduced through decomposition into more focused classes."
