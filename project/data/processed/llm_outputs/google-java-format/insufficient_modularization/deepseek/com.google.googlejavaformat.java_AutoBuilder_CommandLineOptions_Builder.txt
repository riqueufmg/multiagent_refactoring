    "justification": "Class has high method count (nom=19) and field count (nof=20) with moderate complexity (wmc=43), indicating insufficient decomposition. Low LCOM (0.105) suggests cohesive methods, but the size and method count exceed typical single-responsibility thresholds, suggesting further modularization could reduce implementation complexity."
