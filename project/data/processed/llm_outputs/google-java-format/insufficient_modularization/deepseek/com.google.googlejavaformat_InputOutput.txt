{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.InputOutput",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with 5 being public (nopm=5) and 15 weighted methods per class (wmc=15), indicating high implementation complexity. It also has 4 fields (nof=4) and 86 lines of code (loc=86), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The dependencies on Newlines and Input imply it manages both input parsing and output formatting, which could be separated into distinct modules."
