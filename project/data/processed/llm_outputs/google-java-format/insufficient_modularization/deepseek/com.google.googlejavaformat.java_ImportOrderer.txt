    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ImportOrderer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 17 methods (nom=17) and 54 weighted methods per class (wmc=54), indicating many responsibilities. It contains 370 lines of code (loc=370) and 17 fields (nof=17), suggesting multiple concerns are combined. The presence of multiple inner class dependencies (StringAndIndex, Import, ImportsAndIndex, ImportType) within the same class further indicates insufficient decomposition of related concepts."
