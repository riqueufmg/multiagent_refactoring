    "justification": "Class has low complexity (WMC=6, LOC=46, NOM=6), no fields (NOF=1 indicates only one field), high cohesion (LCOM=1.0 indicates all methods use the single field), and no dependencies that suggest bloated responsibilities. Further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
