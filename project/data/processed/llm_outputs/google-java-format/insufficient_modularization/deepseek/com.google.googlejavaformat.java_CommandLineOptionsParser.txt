    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.CommandLineOptionsParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods (nom=6) and 127 lines of code (loc=127) with a weighted method complexity of 34 (wmc=34), indicating significant implementation complexity. It has 3 fields (nof=3) and no dependencies beyond a single Builder class, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities internally. The lack of decomposition is evident from the high method count and complexity relative to its isolated functionality."
