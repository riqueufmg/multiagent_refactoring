    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Trees",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) with only 2 being public (nopm=2), indicating many internal methods that could be grouped by responsibility. The LOC (134) and WMC (20) suggest moderate size and complexity, but the high method count relative to public interface and lack of decomposition (nc=0, nof=0) show insufficient modularization."
