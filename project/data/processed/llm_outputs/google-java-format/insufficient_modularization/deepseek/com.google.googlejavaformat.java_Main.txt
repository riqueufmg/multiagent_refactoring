    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Main",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 4 public methods (nopm=4) and a high weighted method count (wmc=35) and lines of code (loc=227), indicating significant implementation complexity. The lack of decomposition is evident as it handles multiple responsibilities including command-line parsing, version display, and file formatting, all within a single class."
