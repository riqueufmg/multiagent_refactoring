    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ModifierOrderer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods (nom=7) and 180 lines of code (loc=180), indicating significant size and implementation complexity. The LCOM value of 0.43 suggests moderate cohesion, and the presence of an inner class 'ModifierTokens' as a dependency hints at incomplete decomposition. The class could be further decomposed to reduce its size and complexity."
