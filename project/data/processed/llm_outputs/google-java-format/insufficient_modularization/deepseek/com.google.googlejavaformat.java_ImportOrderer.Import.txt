    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ImportOrderer.Import",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields, 0 methods, 77 lines of code, and 0 dependencies. While LOC is moderately high, the lack of methods (nom=0) and low field count suggest it is primarily a data structure rather than a class with complex behavior requiring decomposition. LCOM=-1 indicates no cohesion issues, and no dependencies suggest minimal coupling concerns."
