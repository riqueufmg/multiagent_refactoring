    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics (LOC=328, WMC=46, NOM=14) and a large number of fields (NOF=9), indicating it may be handling multiple responsibilities. The low LCOM (0.14) suggests good cohesion, but the overall size and complexity suggest further decomposition could reduce implementation complexity."
