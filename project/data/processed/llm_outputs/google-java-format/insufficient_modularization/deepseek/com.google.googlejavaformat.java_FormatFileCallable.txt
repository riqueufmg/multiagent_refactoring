    "justification": "Class has low complexity (WMC=11, LOC=69), low method count (NOM=4), and no fields (NOF=4 includes nested class). Dependencies are all external utility classes, not indicating internal responsibility overload. No evidence of high implementation complexity or large size requiring further decomposition."
