    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor.AnnotationOrModifier",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field and 0 methods, with 32 lines of code, indicating it may be a simple data holder or enum that could be further decomposed or integrated elsewhere. The lack of methods (nom=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) suggest insufficient modularization for a standalone class."
