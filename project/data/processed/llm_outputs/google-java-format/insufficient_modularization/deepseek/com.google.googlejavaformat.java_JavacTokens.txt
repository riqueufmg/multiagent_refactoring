{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavacTokens",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 fields (nof=9) and only 3 methods (nom=3), resulting in a high field-to-method ratio. It contains two inner classes (CommentSavingTokenizer, AccessibleScanner) as dependencies, suggesting functionality that could be further decomposed. The LCOM value of 0.67 indicates moderate cohesion, and the class size (loc=165) and complexity (wmc=13) could be reduced by extracting responsibilities from the main class."
