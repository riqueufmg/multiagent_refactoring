    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (loc=78, wmc=5, nom=3, nof=2) and minimal dependencies. It shows no signs of being large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition. The LCOM value of 1.0 indicates high cohesion, which is desirable and suggests the class is already well-modularized."
