    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 70 lines of code (loc=70), and no dependencies. While the LOC is moderate, the lack of methods and minimal state suggests it is already a simple, focused class. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
