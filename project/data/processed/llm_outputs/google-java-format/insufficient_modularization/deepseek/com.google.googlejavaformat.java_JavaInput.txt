    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (474) and WMC (64) are high, indicating a large and complex class. It has many methods (nom=23) and fields (nof=19), suggesting multiple responsibilities. The LCOM value (0.17) indicates low cohesion, which is a sign of insufficient modularization."
