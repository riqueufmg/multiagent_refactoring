    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: 167 methods (nom), 3233 lines of code (loc), and 560 weighted methods per class (wmc). It contains 17 inner classes (nof) and 75 public methods (nopm), indicating it handles many responsibilities. The low LCOM (0.036) suggests high method cohesion, but the excessive size and method count show insufficient decomposition into smaller, focused classes."
