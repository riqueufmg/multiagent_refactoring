    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInput.Tok",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields and 73 lines of code, with no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero weighted methods (wmc=0). This indicates minimal implementation complexity. The lack of methods suggests it is likely a simple data structure or enum, not a class requiring further decomposition."
