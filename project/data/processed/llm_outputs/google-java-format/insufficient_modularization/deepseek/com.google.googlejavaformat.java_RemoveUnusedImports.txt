    "justification": "Class has high complexity (WMC=24, LOC=215) with 10 methods and 8 fields, suggesting multiple responsibilities. It contains two inner classes (DocTreeScanner, UnusedImportScanner) that could potentially be extracted, and the LCOM=0.3 indicates moderate cohesion, supporting further decomposition."
