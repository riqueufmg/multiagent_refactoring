    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (128 LOC, 10 methods) and low complexity (WMC 14, LCOM 0.4). It has no fan-in or fan-out, indicating it is a leaf class. The number of methods and fields is not excessive, and the dependencies are typical for a formatter facade. No clear indicators of insufficient decomposition exist."
