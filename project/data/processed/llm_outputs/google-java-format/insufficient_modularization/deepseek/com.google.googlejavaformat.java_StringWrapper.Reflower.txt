{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.StringWrapper.Reflower",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 fields (nof=7) and 107 lines of code (loc=107), indicating significant size and potential complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests all logic is implemented elsewhere or through inheritance, but the high field count and LOC in a single class point to insufficient decomposition where responsibilities could be split into smaller, more focused modules."
