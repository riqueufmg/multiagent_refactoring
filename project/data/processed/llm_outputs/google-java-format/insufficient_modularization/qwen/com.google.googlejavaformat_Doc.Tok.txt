    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and only 56 lines of code (loc=56). It has only 2 fields (nof=2) and no dependencies on other classes except Input. The class appears to be a simple data holder or token class with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
