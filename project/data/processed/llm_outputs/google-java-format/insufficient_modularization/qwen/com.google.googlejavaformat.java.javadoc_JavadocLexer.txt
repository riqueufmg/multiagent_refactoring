    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.JavadocLexer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 81 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 375 indicating a large class size, and it has 18 methods (NOM). The high WMC value suggests the class has complex internal logic that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more manageable components. The LCOM value of 0.278 indicates some cohesion issues, and the class contains 34 fields (NOF) which further contributes to its complexity and size."
