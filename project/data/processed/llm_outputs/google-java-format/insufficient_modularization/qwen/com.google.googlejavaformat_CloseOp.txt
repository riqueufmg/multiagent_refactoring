    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.CloseOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 17 lines of code (loc=17), which indicates a small and simple class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=3), and there are no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), suggesting minimal complexity. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already well-decomposed with a manageable size and low implementation complexity."
