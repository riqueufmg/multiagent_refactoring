    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaFormatterOptions.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=9, but this likely includes braces and comments only), and no dependencies. The metrics indicate this is a minimal builder class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of complex functionality that would benefit from further decomposition."
