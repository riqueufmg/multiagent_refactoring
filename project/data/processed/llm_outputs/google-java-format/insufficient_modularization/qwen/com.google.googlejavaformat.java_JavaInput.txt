    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInput",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 23 methods (nom), 64 weighted methods per class (wmc), and 474 lines of code (loc). The high number of methods and weighted method count suggest the class is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has multiple dependencies (7 total), indicating it has complex responsibilities that span across different concerns."
