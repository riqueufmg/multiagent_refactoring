    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.JavadocWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 36 methods (nom=36) and 247 lines of code (loc=247), indicating high complexity and size that could benefit from decomposition. The weighted method count (wmc=50) further confirms high implementation complexity. The presence of nested classes (RequestedWhitespace, AutoIndent) and multiple dependencies suggests functionality that could be further modularized into separate cohesive units."
