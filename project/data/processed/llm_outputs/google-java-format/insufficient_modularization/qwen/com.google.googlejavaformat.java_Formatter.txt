    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Formatter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 10 methods (nom=10) and 14 weighted method count (wmc=14), indicating significant implementation complexity. The class also has 128 lines of code (loc=128) which is substantial for a single class. Additionally, it has 3 fields (nof=3) and depends on 14 external classes (14 dependencies listed), suggesting it has multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
