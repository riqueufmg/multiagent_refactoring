    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and very low complexity (loc=5). With minimal functionality and low complexity, there is no indication that further decomposition would provide benefits. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple nature."
