    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.StringWrapper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 14 methods (nom), 46 weighted methods per class (wmc), and 328 lines of code (loc). The low cohesion value (lcom = 0.1428571428571428) suggests that the class may contain unrelated functionalities that could be decomposed into separate modules. The combination of high method count, high cyclomatic complexity, and significant lines of code indicates insufficient modularization where further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
