    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (46 LOC), low complexity (WMC=6), single responsibility (LCOM=1.0), and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The 6 methods are all public and likely represent a cohesive set of operations for an output handling class. No clear indication of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
