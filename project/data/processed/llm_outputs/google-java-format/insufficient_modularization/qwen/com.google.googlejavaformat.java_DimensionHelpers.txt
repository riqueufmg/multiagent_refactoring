    "class": "com.google.googlegooglejavaformat.java.DimensionHelpers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 fields (nof=2), and low weighted method count (wmc=10). The lines of code (loc=73) are reasonable for a utility class. LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the absence of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests simple usage patterns. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains manageable size and complexity."
