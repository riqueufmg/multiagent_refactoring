    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.StringWrapper.LongStringsAndTextBlockScanner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and only 32 lines of code (loc=32). It contains no fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and no method invocations (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating it is already highly decomposed or is a simple data holder. The lack of complexity and small size do not indicate insufficient modularization."
