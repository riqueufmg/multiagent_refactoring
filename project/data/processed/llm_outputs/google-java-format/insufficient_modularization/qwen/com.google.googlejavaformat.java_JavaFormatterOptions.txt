    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6, wmc=6), 52 lines of code (loc=52), and 1 field (nof=1). The LCOM value of 0.667 indicates reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be a simple data class or options holder with minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
