    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.OpsBuilder.BlankLineWanted",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 63 lines of code (loc=63). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and simple field structure (nopf=3) indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit complexity that would require further modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class needing decomposition."
