{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.FormattingError",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 3 public methods (nopm=3), low lines of code (loc=16), and low weighted method count (wmc=3). The LCOM value of 0.667 indicates reasonable cohesion. The class has minimal dependencies with only one dependency on FormatterDiagnostic. Given these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already well-decomposed with appropriate size and complexity."
