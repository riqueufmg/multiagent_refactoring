    "class": "com.google.google.googlejavaformat.java.AutoValue_FormatFileCallable_Result",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (52 LOC, 8 methods) and low complexity (WMC=11). The lack of field declarations (nof=4, nopf=0) and method parameters (nopm=3) suggests a simple data carrier rather than a complex class requiring decomposition. No external dependencies indicate limited scope, and the low LCOM value (0.0) suggests good cohesion among existing members."
