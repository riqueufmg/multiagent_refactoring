    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.AutoValue_JavaFormatterOptions.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3, nopf=0). The lines of code (loc=38) are minimal and the class serves as a simple builder pattern implementation. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already appropriately decomposed for its limited functionality."
