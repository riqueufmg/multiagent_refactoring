    "justification": "The class has 7 lines of code (loc=7) and all other metrics are 0 or minimal (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The class appears to be a minimal or empty class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it lacks complexity that would require further decomposition."
