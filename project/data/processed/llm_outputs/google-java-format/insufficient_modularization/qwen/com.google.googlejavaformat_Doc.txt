{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 536 lines of code (LOC), 28 fields (NOF), 8 methods (NOM) with only 1 public method (NOPM), and 5 nested/inner classes (NC). The high number of fields and lines of code suggests the class could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The low public method ratio (1/8) indicates potential encapsulation of related functionality into separate modules."
