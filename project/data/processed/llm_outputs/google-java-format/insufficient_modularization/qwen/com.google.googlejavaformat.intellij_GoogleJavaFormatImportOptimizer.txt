    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 43 lines of code (loc=43), with a low weighted method count (wmc=7). The class is focused on import optimization functionality and has reasonable size and complexity. No clear indication of insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately decomposed for its responsibilities."
