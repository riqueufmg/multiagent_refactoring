    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is a minimal data class or exception class that does not contain complex logic or implementation details that would benefit from further decomposition. The low LOC (2) and WMC (0) values confirm this is a simple class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
