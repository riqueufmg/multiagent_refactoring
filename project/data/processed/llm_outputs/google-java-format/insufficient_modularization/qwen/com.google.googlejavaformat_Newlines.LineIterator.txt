{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Newlines.LineIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 34 lines of code. The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies suggest this class is not heavily used or interconnected. The metrics indicate a simple, lightweight class rather than one suffering from insufficient modularization."
