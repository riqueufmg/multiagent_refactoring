    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaFormatterBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods (3 public), 90 lines of code, and WMC of 20. While the class has some complexity, it is not excessively large or complex given its functionality as a formatter base class. The low LCOM value (0.25) indicates good cohesion, and the limited number of fields (2) and methods suggest reasonable modularization. The metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization."
