    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 27 lines of code (loc). It also has minimal dependencies with only 2 fanout connections and no fanin. The low number of fields (nof=1) and lack of inheritance (dit=0) indicate this is a simple, focused class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
