    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 4 fields (nof). The lines of code (loc) is 39 which is relatively small. There are no dependencies indicating it's already well isolated. The class appears to be a simple data holder or token representation with minimal functionality that doesn't require further decomposition."
