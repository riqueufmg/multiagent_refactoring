    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.StringWrapper.Reflower",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 7 fields and 107 lines of code. It has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and no dependencies, indicating it is already well-decomposed. The lack of methods suggests this is likely a data-only class or inner class with focused responsibility, not exhibiting insufficient modularization."
