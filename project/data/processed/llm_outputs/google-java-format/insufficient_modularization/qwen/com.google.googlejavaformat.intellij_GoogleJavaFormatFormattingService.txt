    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods (3 public), 3 fields (1 public), and WMC of 9. LOC is 70 which is reasonable for a service class. LCOM of 0.857 suggests good cohesion. The class appears to have a single responsibility of formatting services and does not show signs of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
