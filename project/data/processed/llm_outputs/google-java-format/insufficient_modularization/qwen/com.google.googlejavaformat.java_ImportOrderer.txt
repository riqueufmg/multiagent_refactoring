{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ImportOrderer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17) and 370 lines of code (loc=370), with a high weighted method count (wmc=54) indicating significant implementation complexity. The class also contains multiple inner classes (Import, ImportType, StringAndIndex, ImportsAndIndex) suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The high number of methods and lines of code, combined with the complexity indicated by WMC, suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
