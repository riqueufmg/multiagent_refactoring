    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.RemoveUnusedImports.DocTreeScanner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 28 lines of code, 1 field, no methods, and no dependencies. The metrics indicate minimal implementation complexity and size, suggesting it is already sufficiently decomposed. No further decomposition would provide meaningful reduction in complexity or size."
