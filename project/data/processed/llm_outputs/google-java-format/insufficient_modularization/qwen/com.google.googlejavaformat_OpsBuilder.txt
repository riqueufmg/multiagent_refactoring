{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.OpsBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 36 methods (nom=36) and 504 lines of code (loc=504), indicating high size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=89) further confirms high implementation complexity. The class also declares 14 fields (nof=14) and 33 public methods (nopm=33), suggesting it has too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high LCOM value (0.1666666666666666) indicates poor cohesion, supporting the need for further modularization."
