    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted methods (wmc), and only 26 lines of code (loc). It contains 3 fields (nof) but no public fields (nopf), indicating proper encapsulation. The lack of methods and low size suggest it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
