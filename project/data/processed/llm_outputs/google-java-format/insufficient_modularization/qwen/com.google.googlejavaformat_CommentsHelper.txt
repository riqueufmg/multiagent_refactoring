    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 24 lines of code (loc=24), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class is not overly complex in terms of data. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and simple dependencies (only one dependency to Input) further support that this is a well-modularized, focused class that does not require further decomposition."
