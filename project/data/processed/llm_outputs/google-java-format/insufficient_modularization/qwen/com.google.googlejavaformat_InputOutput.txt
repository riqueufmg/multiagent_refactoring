    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.InputOutput",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods (5 public) and 86 lines of code. The WMC of 15 indicates reasonable method complexity. With only 2 attributes and LCOM of 0.0, the class shows good cohesion. The low number of methods and attributes, combined with the manageable LOC and WMC metrics, does not indicate insufficient modularization."
