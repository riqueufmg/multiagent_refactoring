{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.FormatFileCallable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (69 LOC) and complexity (WMC=11) with only 4 methods and 4 fields. While it has multiple dependencies (7), this reflects its role as a coordinator/callable that integrates various formatting components. The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion among class members. The class appears to have appropriate responsibilities for a callable that formats files, coordinating between different formatting utilities and exception handling."
