    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.AutoValue_JavaFormatterOptions",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 7 methods (nom), 6 public methods (nopm), and 80 lines of code (loc). The weighted method count (wmc) is 9, indicating low method complexity. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest this is a simple value class. The class appears to be auto-generated (indicated by file path containing 'generated-sources') and serves a specific, limited purpose with appropriate size and complexity for its function."
