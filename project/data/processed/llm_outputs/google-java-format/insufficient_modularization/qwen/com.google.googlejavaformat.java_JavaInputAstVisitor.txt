    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 167 methods (nom=167) and 3233 lines of code (loc=3233), with a high weighted method count (wmc=560), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The large number of methods and lines of code imply the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more manageable units."
