    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 10 lines of code (loc=10). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) indicating no method complexity. With minimal size and complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed for its current functionality."
