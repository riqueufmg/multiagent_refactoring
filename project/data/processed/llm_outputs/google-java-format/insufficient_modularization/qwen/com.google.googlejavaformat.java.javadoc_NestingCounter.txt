    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.NestingCounter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a small and manageable size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=8), suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to have a single responsibility and is already well-decomposed. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the absence of public fields (nopf=0, nopm=0) suggests proper encapsulation. The class does not exhibit signs of needing further decomposition."
