{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ModifierOrderer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods and WMC of 38, which is manageable. The LOC is 180 which is reasonable for a single class. LCOM of 0.4285714285714285 indicates good cohesion. The class has only 2 fields and no public fields, suggesting proper encapsulation. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies indicate low coupling. The modularization appears sufficient given the class size and complexity metrics."
