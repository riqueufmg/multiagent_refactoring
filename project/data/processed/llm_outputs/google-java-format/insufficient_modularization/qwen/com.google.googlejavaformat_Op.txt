    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Op",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 10 lines of code (loc=10), and 6 nested classes (nc=6). The low number of methods and low cyclomatic complexity indicate that further decomposition would not significantly reduce size or complexity. The class appears to be a simple container or utility class with minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further modularization."
