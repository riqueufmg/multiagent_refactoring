    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods (4 public) and 68 lines of code. The WMC of 9 indicates low complexity. LCOM of 0.25 suggests good cohesion. The class has only 3 fields and no nested classes, indicating it is already well decomposed. The size and complexity are within reasonable limits for a single class."
