    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 1 field (nof=1), with low complexity (wmc=5, loc=126). The LCOM value of 1.0 indicates good cohesion, and there are no external dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships suggesting it is appropriately modularized for its current functionality."
