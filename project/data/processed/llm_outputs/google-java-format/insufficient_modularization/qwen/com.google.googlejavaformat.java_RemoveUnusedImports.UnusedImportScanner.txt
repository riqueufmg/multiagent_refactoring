    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6), 0 methods (nom=0), and 88 lines of code (loc=88). While the class has some size, the low method count and simple structure do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a focused scanner implementation with minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
