    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.JavadocFormatter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 40 and 8 methods, indicating it may be doing too much. The LOC is 99 which is relatively high for a single class, and it has 5 fields with only 1 private method, suggesting insufficient decomposition. The class also has dependencies on 3 other classes, indicating it coordinates multiple responsibilities rather than having a single focused purpose."
