    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 2 fields (nof=2), with low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lines of code (loc=60) are relatively small and the lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests simple functionality. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its small size and complexity."
