    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.TypeNameClassifier.TyParseState",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, NC=0, DIT=0) and only 70 lines of code. There are no methods or fields indicating complex implementation that would benefit from further decomposition. The low fanin and fanout suggest minimal responsibilities, and the LCOM value of -1.0 indicates good cohesion where it applies."
