{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.UsageException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom), 4 fields (nof), 33 lines of code (loc), and a low weighted method count (wmc=6). The lack of private methods (nopm=0) and low LCOM value (0.0) indicate good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple exception class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
