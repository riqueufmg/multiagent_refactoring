    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 35 and LOC of 227, indicating it may be doing too much. It has 9 methods with only 4 being public, suggesting internal complexity. The class depends on 5 other classes, indicating it coordinates multiple responsibilities. LCOM of 0.555 suggests moderate lack of cohesion, and the class appears to be a main entry point that likely handles command line parsing, formatting coordination, and error handling - responsibilities that could be further decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
