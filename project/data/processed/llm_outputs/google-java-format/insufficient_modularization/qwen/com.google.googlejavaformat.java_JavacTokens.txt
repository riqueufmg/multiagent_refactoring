    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavacTokens",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (165 LOC) and complexity (WMC=13, NOM=3). The LCOM value of 0.667 indicates some cohesion issues but is not severe enough to indicate insufficient modularization. The class has minimal external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and contains only 9 fields with 3 methods, suggesting appropriate decomposition. No clear evidence of unreasonably large or complex implementation that would benefit from further decomposition."
