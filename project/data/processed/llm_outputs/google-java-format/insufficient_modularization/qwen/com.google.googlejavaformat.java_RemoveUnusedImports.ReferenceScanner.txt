{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.RemoveUnusedImports.ReferenceScanner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 10 lines of code (loc=10), and minimal metrics across all other complexity measures (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0). The low size and complexity indicate sufficient modularization as the class is already appropriately small and simple."
