    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 23 lines of code (loc=23), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With such minimal size and complexity, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already appropriately decomposed."
