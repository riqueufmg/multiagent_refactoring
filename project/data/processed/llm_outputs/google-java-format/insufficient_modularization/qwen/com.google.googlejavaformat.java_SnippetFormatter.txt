    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.SnippetFormatter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 24 and LOC of 139, indicating it may be doing too much. It has 8 methods with only 5 fields, suggesting potential grouping of functionality. The class has multiple dependencies (6) including nested classes, indicating it coordinates several responsibilities. LCOM of 0.25 suggests some methods may not be cohesive with others, pointing to potential decomposition opportunities. The combination of high complexity metrics and multiple dependencies indicates insufficient modularization."
