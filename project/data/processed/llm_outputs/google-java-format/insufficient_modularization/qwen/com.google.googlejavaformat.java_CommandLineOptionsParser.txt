    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.CommandLineOptionsParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high Weighted Method Complexity (WMC=34) with only 6 methods, indicating complex implementations. The Lines of Code (LOC=127) are relatively high for such a small number of methods, suggesting each method is complex. The class has 3 fields and 6 methods with high complexity metrics, showing insufficient decomposition of functionality. The lack of inheritance (DIT=0) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates this is a standalone complex class that could benefit from further modularization to reduce implementation complexity."
