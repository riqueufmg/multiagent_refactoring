    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.FormatterDiagnostic",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods (6 public) and 54 lines of code. The WMC of 10 indicates reasonable method complexity. With only 3 fields and no dependencies, the class appears to have focused responsibilities. The size and complexity are within acceptable ranges for a well-modularized class, showing no clear indication that further decomposition would be beneficial."
