    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.FormatterException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 7 methods (nom), 2 fields (nof), 40 lines of code (loc), and weighted method count (wmc) of 9. The LCOM value of 0.5714285714285714 indicates reasonable cohesion. With only 2 fields and 7 methods, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
