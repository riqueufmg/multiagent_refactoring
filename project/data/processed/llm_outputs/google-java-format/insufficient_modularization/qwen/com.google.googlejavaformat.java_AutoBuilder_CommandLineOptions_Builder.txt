    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.AutoBuilder_CommandLineOptions_Builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 19 methods (nom), 43 weighted method count (wmc), and 165 lines of code (loc). It also has 20 fields (nof) with only 18 public methods (nopm), indicating poor encapsulation. The low LCOM value (0.105) suggests cohesive methods, but the high method count and complexity indicate insufficient modularization. The class implements builder pattern but lacks proper decomposition of responsibilities."
