    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.AutoOneOf_JavaInputAstVisitor_AnnotationOrModifier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 fields (nof=2), and low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lines of code (loc=78) are reasonable for a generated class. LCOM value of 1.0 indicates good cohesion. This appears to be an auto-generated class with minimal functionality that is appropriately modularized for its purpose."
