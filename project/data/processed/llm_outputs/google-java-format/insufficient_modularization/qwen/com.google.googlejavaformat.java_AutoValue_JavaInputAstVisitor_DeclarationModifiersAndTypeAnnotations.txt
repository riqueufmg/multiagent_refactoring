    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 3 public), low complexity (WMC=10), small size (41 LOC), and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). While it has 2 fields, the overall metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be a simple data holder or value object with appropriate cohesion."
