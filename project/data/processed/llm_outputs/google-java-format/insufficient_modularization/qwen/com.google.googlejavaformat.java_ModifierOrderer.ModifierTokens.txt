    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ModifierOrderer.ModifierTokens",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 48 lines of code (loc=48). With minimal complexity (wmc=0) and no inheritance (dit=0), the class is already sufficiently decomposed. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate it serves a single, focused purpose as a data holder for modifier tokens."
