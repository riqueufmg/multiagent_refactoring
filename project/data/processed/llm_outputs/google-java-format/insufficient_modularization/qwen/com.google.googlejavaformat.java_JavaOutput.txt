    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 16 methods and WMC of 63, which is manageable. The LCOM value of 0.1875 indicates good cohesion within the class. With only 277 lines of code, it's reasonably sized. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies suggests it's not heavily coupled to other components. While there are 12 fields, the overall structure appears well-contained and appropriately modularized for its responsibilities."
