    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor.DimensionsOrNot",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 7 lines of code (loc=7). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies or coupling issues. This indicates a minimal, well-contained class that does not require further decomposition."
