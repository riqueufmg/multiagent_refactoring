    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 73 lines of code, 7 fields, and no methods. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond the basic Input dependency. The class appears to be a simple data holder or token class that is already sufficiently modularized for its purpose."
