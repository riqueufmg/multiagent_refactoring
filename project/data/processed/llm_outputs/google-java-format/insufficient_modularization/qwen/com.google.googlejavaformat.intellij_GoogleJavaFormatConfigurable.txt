    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.intellij.GoogleJavaFormatConfigurable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 73 lines of code (loc=73), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=14) matches the number of methods, indicating simple method complexity. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.4285714285714285) suggest the class is focused and not overly complex. While it has some fields (nof=4), the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
