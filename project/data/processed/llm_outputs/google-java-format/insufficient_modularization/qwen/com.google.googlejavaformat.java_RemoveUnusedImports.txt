    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.RemoveUnusedImports",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 24 which is high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 215 indicating substantial size, NOM (Number of Methods) is 10 suggesting high behavioral complexity, and the class contains 8 fields. The presence of inner classes (DocTreeScanner, UnusedImportScanner) and multiple external dependencies further indicates that this class handles complex functionality that could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
