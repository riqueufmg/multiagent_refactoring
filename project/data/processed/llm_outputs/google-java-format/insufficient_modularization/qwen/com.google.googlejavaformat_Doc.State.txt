    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 4 fields, 0 methods, and 27 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies or fanout connections. The class appears to be a simple data holder or state container that is already sufficiently modularized given its minimal functionality."
