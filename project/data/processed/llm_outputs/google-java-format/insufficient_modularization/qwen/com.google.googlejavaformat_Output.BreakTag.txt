    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 12 lines of code (loc=12). It has no fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and no dependencies, indicating it is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
