    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Input.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 20 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0 indicating minimal computational complexity. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, its extremely small size and simplicity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple data holder or value object."
