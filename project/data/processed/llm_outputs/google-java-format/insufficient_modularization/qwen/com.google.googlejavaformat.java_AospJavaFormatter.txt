    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.AospJavaFormatter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=8), and minimal dependencies (only 1 dependency on JavaFormatterOptions). The Weighted Method Count (wmc=1) indicates very low implementation complexity. There is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
