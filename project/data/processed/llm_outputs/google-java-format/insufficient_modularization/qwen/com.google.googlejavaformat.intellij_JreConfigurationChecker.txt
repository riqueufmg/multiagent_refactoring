    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.intellij.JreConfigurationChecker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods and WMC of 10, but LCOM of 0.714 suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 50 lines of code and 3 fields, the class size is manageable. The low number of methods (7) and relatively low WMC indicate the class is not overly complex. While some decomposition could be possible, the current modularization appears sufficient given the class's limited scope and complexity."
