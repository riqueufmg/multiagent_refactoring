    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Trees",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 14 methods (nom), WMC of 20 indicating high internal complexity, and 134 lines of code (loc). With only 2 public methods out of 14 total methods (nopm/nom ratio of ~14%), the class appears to have significant internal implementation complexity that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The lack of fields (nof=0) and low public interface suggests this could be a utility-like class with concentrated functionality that warrants modularization."
