    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor.VarArgsOrNot",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods or fields to decompose further, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately simple and focused."
