    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInput.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, 43 lines of code, and no dependencies on other classes beyond the parent Input class. The low number of fields and methods indicates proper modularization, and the class appears to be a simple data holder or token representation that does not require further decomposition."
