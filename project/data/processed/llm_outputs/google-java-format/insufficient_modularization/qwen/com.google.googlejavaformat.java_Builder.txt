    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 20 methods (nom=20) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=20) matches the number of methods, indicating simple complexity per method. With only 2 attributes (nc=2) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to have focused responsibilities. The lack of public methods (nopm=0) and fields (nopf=0) suggests proper encapsulation. While the method count is somewhat high, the low complexity per method and small size do not indicate insufficient modularization."
