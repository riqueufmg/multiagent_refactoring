    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.Token.Type",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 37 lines of code (loc=37). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) indicating minimal implementation complexity. Since this is likely an enum or simple type definition with no substantial functionality, it does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already appropriately decomposed for its purpose."
