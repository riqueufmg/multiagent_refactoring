    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.FormatFileCallable.Result",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 12 lines of code (loc=12) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0). It also has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=0) indicates no method complexity. This appears to be a simple data holder or result object that is appropriately decomposed given its minimal functionality."
