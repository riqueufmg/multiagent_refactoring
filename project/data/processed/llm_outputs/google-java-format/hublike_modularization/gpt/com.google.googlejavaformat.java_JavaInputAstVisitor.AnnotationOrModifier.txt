    "justification": "The class has a very small set of outgoing dependencies (only com.google.googlejavaformat.Input, with references to Input.Token and FormatterDiagnostic). It has incoming references from a single class (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor). There are not many distinct incoming or outgoing abstraction dependencies in the provided data, so it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
