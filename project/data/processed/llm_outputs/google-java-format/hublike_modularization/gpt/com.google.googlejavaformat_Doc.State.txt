    "justification": "Doc.State has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies with other abstractions. The provided data shows Doc.State interacts only with a single other class, so it does not meet the criteria for a hub."
