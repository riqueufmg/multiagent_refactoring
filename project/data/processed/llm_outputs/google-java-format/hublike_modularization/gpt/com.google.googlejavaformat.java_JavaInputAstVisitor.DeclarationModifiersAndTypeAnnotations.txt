    "justification": "This class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []) and only a single incoming dependency (one incoming class: com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor). Although that incoming class references many other abstractions, the analyzed class itself does not have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
