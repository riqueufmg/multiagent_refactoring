    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming=1 and outgoing=0, so the class does not meet the criteria. Note: the incoming class references many types, but that does not make this class itself a hub because it lacks multiple incoming/outgoing links."
