    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FormattingFiler has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Formatter) and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the Formatter (the single outgoing dependency) itself depends on many classes, FormattingFiler in isolation is not connected to many abstractions and therefore is not a hub."
