    "justification": "NestingCounter has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.JavadocLexer and com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.JavadocWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; with only two incoming links and no outgoing links, this class does not meet that criterion."
