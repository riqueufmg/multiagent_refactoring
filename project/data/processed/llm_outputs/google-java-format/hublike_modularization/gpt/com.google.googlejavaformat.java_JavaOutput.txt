    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JavaOutput has 6 outgoing dependencies (Formatter, Input, CommentsHelper, Newlines, InputOutput, Replacement) and only 2 incoming dependents (Formatter, JavaInput). The set of unique interacting abstractions is 7 (Formatter, Input, CommentsHelper, Newlines, InputOutput, Replacement, JavaInput). These counts show limited bi-directional connectivity rather than a large number of incoming and outgoing links; therefore JavaOutput does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
