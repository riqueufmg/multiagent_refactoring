    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []), and only a single incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.JavadocLexer). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing links; these counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
