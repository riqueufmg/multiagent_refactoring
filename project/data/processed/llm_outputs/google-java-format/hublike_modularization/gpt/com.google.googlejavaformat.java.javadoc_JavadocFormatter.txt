    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JavadocFormatter has few incoming and outgoing connections: incoming from JavaCommentsHelper and JavadocWriter (2 incoming), and outgoing to JavadocLexer, Token, and JavadocWriter (3 outgoing). The counts are small and there is no evidence in the provided data of dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. (There is a bidirectional link with JavadocWriter, but that alone does not constitute a hub-like modularization.)"
