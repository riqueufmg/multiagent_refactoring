    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 0 outgoing dependencies (incoming_dependencies: [], outgoing_dependencies: []). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and outgoing links); this class has none, so it does not exhibit the smell."
