    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two outgoing dependencies (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.FormatterException, com.google.googlejavaformat.java.FormatFileCallable). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not the case here."
