    "justification": "Token has 3 incoming dependencies (JavadocFormatter, JavadocLexer, JavadocWriter) but only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.Token.Type). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing dependencies are minimal and limited to its nested Type, so this does not qualify as a hub."
