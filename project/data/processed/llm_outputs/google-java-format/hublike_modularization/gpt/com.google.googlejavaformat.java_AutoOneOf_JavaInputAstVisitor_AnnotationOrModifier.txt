    "justification": "The class has only two outgoing dependencies (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor and com.google.googlejavaformat.Input) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
