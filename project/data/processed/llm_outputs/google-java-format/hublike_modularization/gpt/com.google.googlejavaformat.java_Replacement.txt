    "justification": "Replacement has no outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only three incoming dependents (JavaFormatterBase, SnippetFormatter, JavaOutput). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; Replacement lacks outgoing relationships and has a small number of incoming dependents, so it is not a hub."
