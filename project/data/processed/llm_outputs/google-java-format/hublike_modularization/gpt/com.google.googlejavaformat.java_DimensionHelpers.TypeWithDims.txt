    "justification": "The class is not hub-like: it has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.DimensionHelpers (which references TypeWithDims and SortedDims). There are not dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so Hub-like Modularization does not apply."
