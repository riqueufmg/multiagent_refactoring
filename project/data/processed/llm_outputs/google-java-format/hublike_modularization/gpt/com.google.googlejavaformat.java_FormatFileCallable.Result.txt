Although the incoming class lists multiple dependencies (Formatter, RemoveUnusedImports, StringWrapper, ImportOrderer, FormatFileCallable.Result, JavaFormatterOptions, FormatterException), the analyzed class itself does not have many incoming and outgoing relationships required to qualify as a hub."
