    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FormattingJavaFileObject has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Formatter) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the Formatter class (the single outgoing dependency) itself depends on many classes, FormattingJavaFileObject does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
