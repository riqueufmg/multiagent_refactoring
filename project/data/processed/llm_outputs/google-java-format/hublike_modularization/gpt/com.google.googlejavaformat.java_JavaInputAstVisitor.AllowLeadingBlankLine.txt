    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
