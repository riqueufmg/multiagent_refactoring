    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to two abstractions (UiFormatterStyle, GoogleJavaFormatSettings) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 2 (not a large number), so it is not a hub."
