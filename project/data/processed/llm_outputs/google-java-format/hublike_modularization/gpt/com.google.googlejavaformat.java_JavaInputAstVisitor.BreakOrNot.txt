    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor.BreakOrNot",

    "justification": "The analyzed class has no outgoing dependencies (dependencies: []) and no listed outgoing_dependencies. It has a single incoming dependency entry (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor). Therefore, it does not have both incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions as required by the Hub-like Modularization smell."
