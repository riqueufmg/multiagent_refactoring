    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.RemoveUnusedImports). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class shows no such wide incoming/outgoing coupling."
