    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Formatter and com.google.googlejavaformat.intellij.Notifications). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not meet that criterion. (Note: Formatter itself has many dependencies, but those are transitive/second-level and do not make the analyzed class a hub.)"
