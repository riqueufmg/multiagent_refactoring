    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.OpsBuilder). Although OpsBuilder depends on many classes, BlankLineWanted itself interacts with only a single other class and therefore does not meet the criteria for a hub."
