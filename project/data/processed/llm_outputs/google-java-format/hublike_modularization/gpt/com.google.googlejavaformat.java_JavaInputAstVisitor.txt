    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has many outgoing dependencies (21 distinct dependencies) to core formatting and helper abstractions such as com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc, OpsBuilder, Input, OpenOp, CloseOp, Indent, Newlines, Trees, TypeNameClassifier, DimensionHelpers and several internal visitor enums/flags. It also has multiple incoming dependents (6 distinct classes) including com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Formatter and several auto-generated helper types that reference it. Having a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships indicates a hub-like role, satisfying the Hub-like Modularization smell."
