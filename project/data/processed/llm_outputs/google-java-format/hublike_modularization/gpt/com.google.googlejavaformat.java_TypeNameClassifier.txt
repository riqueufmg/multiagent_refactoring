    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.TypeNameClassifier.TyParseState) and only one incoming dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor). Hub-like Modularization is characterized by dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only these single incoming and outgoing links, so the smell is not present."
