    "justification": "Formatter has many outgoing dependencies (14 distinct abstractions): Doc, RemoveUnusedImports, StringWrapper, Newlines, ImportOrderer, JavaInput, JavaFormatterOptions, OpsBuilder, FormatterException, Trees, ModifierOrderer, DocBuilder, JavaInputAstVisitor, JavaOutput. It also has many incoming dependencies (9 distinct abstractions) that depend on it: FormatFileCallable, StringWrapper, SnippetFormatter, JavaCommentsHelper, JavaOutput, FormattingFiler, FormattingJavaFileObject, GoogleJavaFormatFormattingService, GoogleJavaFormatFormattingTask. There are bidirectional relationships (appearing in both lists) such as StringWrapper and JavaOutput. The combination of a large number of both incoming and outgoing links and cross-connections indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
