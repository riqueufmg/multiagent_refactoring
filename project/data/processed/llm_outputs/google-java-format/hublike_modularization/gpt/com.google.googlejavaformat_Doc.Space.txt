    "justification": "Doc.Space has no outgoing dependencies (empty) and only a single incoming dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; Doc.Space does not meet this criterion. Note: while com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc depends on many types, that reflects Doc's dependencies, not Doc.Space's."
