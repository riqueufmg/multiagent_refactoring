    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Trees has incoming dependencies from 4 classes: com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Formatter, com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor, com.google.googlejavaformat.java.StringWrapper, com.google.googlejavaformat.java.RemoveUnusedImports. However, Trees has 0 outgoing dependencies (no listed dependencies). Because it lacks outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the 'both incoming and outgoing with many others' condition for a hub-like module."
