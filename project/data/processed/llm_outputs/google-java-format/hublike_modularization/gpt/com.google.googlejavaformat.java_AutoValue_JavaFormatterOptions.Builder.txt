    "justification": "Not detected: the analyzed class has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaFormatterOptions) and zero incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections; here the number of connected abstractions is small. (The outgoing target lists dependencies back to AutoValue_JavaFormatterOptions and Builder, but the analyzed class itself shows no incoming dependencies and only a single outgoing.)"
