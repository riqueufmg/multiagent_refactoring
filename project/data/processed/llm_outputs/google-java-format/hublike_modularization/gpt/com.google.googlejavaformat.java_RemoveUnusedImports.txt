    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 5 distinct abstractions (RemoveUnusedImports.DocTreeScanner, FormatterException, RemoveUnusedImports.UnusedImportScanner, Trees, Newlines). Incoming dependencies: 3 distinct callers (Formatter, FormatFileCallable, GoogleJavaFormatImportOptimizer). Several outgoing dependencies are internal/nested helpers (DocTreeScanner, UnusedImportScanner) and the total number of distinct incoming and outgoing relationships (3 incoming, 5 outgoing) is not large enough to qualify as a hub that connects a large number of other abstractions. Therefore this class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
