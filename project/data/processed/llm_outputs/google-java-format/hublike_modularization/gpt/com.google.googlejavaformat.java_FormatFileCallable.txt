    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FormatFileCallable has 7 outgoing dependencies (Formatter, RemoveUnusedImports, StringWrapper, ImportOrderer, FormatFileCallable.Result, JavaFormatterOptions, FormatterException) but only 2 incoming dependencies (Main, AutoValue_FormatFileCallable_Result). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. While FormatFileCallable depends on several helpers, it does not receive dependencies from a large number of other abstractions, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
