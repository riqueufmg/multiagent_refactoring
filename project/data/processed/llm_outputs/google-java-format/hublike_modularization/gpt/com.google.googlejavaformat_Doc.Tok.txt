    "justification": "Doc.Tok has only one incoming dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc references Doc.Tok) and only one outgoing dependency (Doc.Tok depends on com.google.googlejavaformat.Input). Because it interacts with a very small number of other abstractions rather than a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
