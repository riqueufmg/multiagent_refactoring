    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StringWrapper has a small number of incoming and outgoing dependencies: outgoing to 4 abstractions (FormatterException, Formatter, Trees, Newlines) and incoming from 2 abstractions (Formatter, FormatFileCallable). The dependency set is limited and concentrated (Formatter appears on both sides), so it does not exhibit the large bi-directional coupling with many other abstractions characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
