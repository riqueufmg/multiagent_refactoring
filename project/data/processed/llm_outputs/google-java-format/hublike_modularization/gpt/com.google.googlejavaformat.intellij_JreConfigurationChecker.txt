    "justification": "The class has 3 incoming dependencies (from com.google.googlejavaformat.intellij.GoogleJavaFormatImportOptimizer, com.google.googlejavaformat.intellij.GoogleJavaFormatSettings, com.google.googlejavaformat.intellij.GoogleJavaFormatFormattingService) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies with other abstractions. Because there are no outgoing dependencies and only a small number (3) of incoming dependencies, this does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
