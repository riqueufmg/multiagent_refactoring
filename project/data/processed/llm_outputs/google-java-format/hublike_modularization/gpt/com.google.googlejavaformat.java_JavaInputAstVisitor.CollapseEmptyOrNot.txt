    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the connection count is minimal. Although the incoming class (JavaInputAstVisitor) lists many dependencies, CollapseEmptyOrNot itself does not have multiple incoming/outgoing relationships and therefore is not a hub."
