    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.JavadocWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks both a large number of incoming references (only one) and any outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
