    "justification": "AutoIndent has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc.JavadocWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; AutoIndent does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
