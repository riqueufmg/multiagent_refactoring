    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.Input) and only one incoming dependent (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInput). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only single incoming and outgoing relationships, so this is not a hub."
