    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ImportOrderer). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here the analyzed class interacts with a single other class only, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
