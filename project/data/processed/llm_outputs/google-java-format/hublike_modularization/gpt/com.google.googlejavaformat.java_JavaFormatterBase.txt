    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. In isolation, JavaFormatterBase has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Replacement, com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaFormatterOptions, com.google.googlejavaformat.java.SnippetFormatter). Because it has no incoming dependencies and only a small set of outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
