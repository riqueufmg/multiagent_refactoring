    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.CloseOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CloseOp has 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.googlejavaformat.DocBuilder, com.google.googlejavaformat.Op) and 2 incoming dependents (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor, com.google.googlejavaformat.OpsBuilder). The total number of distinct connected abstractions is 4, which is not a large number required for Hub-like Modularization. Per the constraint to consider the class in isolation, the additional dependencies listed for the incoming classes do not increase CloseOp's own incoming/outgoing counts."
