    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.SnippetFormatter). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections; here outgoing_dependencies = [] and incoming list contains a single depender: com.google.googlejavaformat.java.SnippetFormatter (which references SnippetFormatter.SnippetKind among other types)."
