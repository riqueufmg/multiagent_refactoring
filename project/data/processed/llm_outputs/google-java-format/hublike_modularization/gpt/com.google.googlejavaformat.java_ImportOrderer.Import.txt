    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ImportOrderer). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies with numerous other abstractions; this class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships. Note: the multiple types listed in the incoming class's dependency list are dependencies of the incoming class, not direct dependencies of the analyzed class."
