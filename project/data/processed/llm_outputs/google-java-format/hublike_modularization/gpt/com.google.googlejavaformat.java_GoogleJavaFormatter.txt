    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.GoogleJavaFormatter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaFormatterOptions) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here incoming_dependencies is empty and outgoing count is 1, so the smell is not present."
