    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ImportOrderer.StringAndIndex",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ImportOrderer). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; neither the outgoing count (0) nor the incoming count (1) is large. Note: although the incoming class ImportOrderer itself references many types, that does not make StringAndIndex a hub because only a single class depends on it."
