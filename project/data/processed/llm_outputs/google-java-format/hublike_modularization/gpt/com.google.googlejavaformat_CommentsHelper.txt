    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.CommentsHelper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CommentsHelper has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.googlejavaformat.Input) and 4 incoming dependents (com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaCommentsHelper, com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaOutput, com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc, com.google.googlejavaformat.Output). The smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the outgoing degree is minimal (1) and the incoming degree is moderate (4), so it does not qualify as hub-like modularization."
