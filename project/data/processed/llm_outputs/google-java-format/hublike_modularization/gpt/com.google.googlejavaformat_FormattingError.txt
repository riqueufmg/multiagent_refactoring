    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.FormattingError",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 1 outgoing dependency: com.google.googlejavaformat.FormatterDiagnostic, and 0 incoming dependencies. These counts are low and there are no incoming links, so FormattingError does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
