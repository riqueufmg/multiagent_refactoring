    "justification": "JavadocLexer has 4 outgoing dependencies (CharStream, Token, JavadocLexer.LexException, NestingCounter) and only 1 incoming dependency (JavadocFormatter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; the provided counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
