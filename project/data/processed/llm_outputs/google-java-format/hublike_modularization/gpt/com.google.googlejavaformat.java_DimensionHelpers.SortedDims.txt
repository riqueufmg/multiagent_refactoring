    "justification": "SortedDims has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.DimensionHelpers). With only a single incoming connection and no outgoing connections, it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions and therefore does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
