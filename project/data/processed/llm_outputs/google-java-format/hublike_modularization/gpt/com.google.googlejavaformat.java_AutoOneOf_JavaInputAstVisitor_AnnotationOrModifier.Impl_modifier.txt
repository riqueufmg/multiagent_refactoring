    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []) and only two outgoing dependencies: com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor and com.google.googlejavaformat.Input. Therefore it does not exhibit the many incoming/outgoing relationships required for a hub-like module."
