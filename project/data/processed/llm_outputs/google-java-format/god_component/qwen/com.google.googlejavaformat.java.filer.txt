    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a total of 102 lines of code, which is not excessively large. Neither of the classes shows indicators of being overly complex or handling too many responsibilities. The lines of code per class (49 and 53) are moderate, and the number of methods and fields is low, suggesting focused responsibilities."
