    "justification": "The package contains 76 classes with a total of 8184 lines of code, indicating a large and complex component. The class JavaInputAstVisitor alone has 3233 lines of code and 167 methods, contributing significantly to the overall size and complexity. The high number of classes and the presence of excessively large classes like JavaInputAstVisitor justify the detection of the God Component smell."
