    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 32 classes with a total of 2478 lines of code. While the package has a considerable number of classes and lines of code, the classes are logically grouped around the core functionality of code formatting. Key classes like Doc (536 LOC), OpsBuilder (504 LOC), and Newlines (159 LOC) are large but appear to encapsulate distinct responsibilities. There is no single class or component that overwhelmingly centralizes the logic or operations of the system. The distribution of responsibilities across multiple cohesive classes indicates a well-structured design rather than a God Component."
