    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes with a total of 888 lines of code, which is not excessively large for a cohesive module handling Javadoc formatting. The largest classes (JavadocLexer with 375 LOC and JavadocWriter with 247 LOC) are specialized components with clear responsibilities. The package exhibits good internal structure and modularity without a single dominant component."
