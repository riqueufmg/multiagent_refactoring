    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package has 32 classes and ~2,478 LOC with a strong concentration of size and complexity in a few classes: Doc (536 LOC, numerous fields/nested types such as Doc.Level, Doc.Token, Doc.Break, etc.) and OpsBuilder (504 LOC, 36 methods, WMC 89). Those two classes alone account for ~42% of the package LOC. Additional mid-sized classes (Newlines 159 LOC, Input 115 LOC) exist, but the presence of very large classes with many responsibilities and high complexity (many methods, high WMC, nested types inside Doc) indicates that functionality is centralized in a small number of oversized components, consistent with the God Component smell."
