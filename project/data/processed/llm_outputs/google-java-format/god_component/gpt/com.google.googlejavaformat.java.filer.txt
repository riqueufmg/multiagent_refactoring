    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.filer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 102 LOC (classes of ~49 and ~53 LOC), so it is small in both number of classes and lines of code. Class metrics show moderate complexity (WMC 8 and 9) and low coupling (fanin 0, fanout 0; Ca=0, Ce=1). Given the limited size and low coupling, there is insufficient evidence to consider this package a God Component."
