    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package totals 1,071 LOC across only 9 classes, with a large concentration in a few classes: JITWatchConfig (568 LOC, 59 fields, 86 methods, WMC 142) and JITWatchConstants (296 LOC, 283 fields). TagProcessor also contributes 170 LOC. This concentration of code and responsibilities in a very small number of classes (high LOC and high method/field counts) — together with a non-trivial afferent coupling (Ca = 14) — supports that the package contains a God Component (excessively large component/class handling many responsibilities)."
