    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 29 classes and 2,474 LOC and acts as a central model hub (Ca = 49, Ce = 5). Several classes are disproportionately large and complex, indicating concentrated responsibilities: MemberSignatureParts (LOC 462, WMC 109, nom 29), AbstractMetaMember (LOC 311, WMC 80, nom 38), Compilation (LOC 280, WMC 71, nom 39), JITDataModel (LOC 228, WMC 50, nom 22), Tag (LOC 177, WMC 46), MetaClass (LOC 165, WMC 43) and JITStats (LOC 168, WMC 43). Multiple high-method-count and high-complexity classes plus high incoming coupling suggest this package is excessively large and centralizes many responsibilities, consistent with the God Component smell."
