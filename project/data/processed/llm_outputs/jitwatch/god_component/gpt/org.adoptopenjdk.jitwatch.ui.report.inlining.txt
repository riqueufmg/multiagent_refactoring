    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.inlining",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 98 LOC, which is small in both number of classes and code size. Individual classes are modest (InliningRowBuilder: 69 LOC, 8 methods; InliningRowBean: 29 LOC, 6 methods). Complexity metrics (WMC ~8 per class), low coupling (fanin/fanout 0, Ca=1, Ce=2) and limited external dependencies indicate responsibilities are narrow rather than concentrated in an excessively large component. Therefore there is no evidence of a God Component."
