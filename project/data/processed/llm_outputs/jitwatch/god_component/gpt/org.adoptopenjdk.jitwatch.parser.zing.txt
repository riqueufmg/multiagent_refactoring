    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.zing",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 378 LOC, but two classes dominate the package: ZingLogParser (LOC 230, NOM 12, WMC 43) and ZingLine (LOC 147, NOM 34, WMC 34), together accounting for virtually all of the package size. ZingLineType is trivial (LOC 1). The high LOC, high method counts and high complexity concentrated in these few classes indicate the component centralizes too much functionality and responsibility, consistent with a God Component smell."
