    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only one class (CompilationChooser) with 48 LOC and modest internal size (6 methods, WMC 11, nof 4). The package/class coupling is low (Ce=2, Ca=2, fanin/fanout 0) and cohesion (LCOM 0.0) does not indicate sprawling responsibilities. Given the small LOC, single class count and limited complexity/coupling, there is no evidence this package is an excessively large \"God Component.\""
