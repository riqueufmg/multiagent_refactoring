    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.suggestion",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 66 LOC (SuggestionRowBuilder: 49 LOC, SuggestionRowBean: 17 LOC), with a small number of methods (nom ~6 and 3). Coupling metrics are low (Ce=1, Ca=1) and there is no evidence of a large number of responsibilities, classes, or extremely high LOC. Class-level complexity and coupling (wmc, fanin/fanout) are not indicative of an exceptionally large or dominant component. Therefore, based on the provided data, this package is not a God Component."
