    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.codecache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 88 LOC (each class ~44 LOC). Individual class metrics show modest complexity (WMC 9) and low coupling (fanin/fanout 0, limited external dependencies). Given the small number of classes, low overall size and limited coupling, there is no evidence this component is excessively large or central enough to be considered a God Component."
