    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util contains 17 classes and 1,880 LOC with a clear concentration of size and responsibility in a few classes. ParseUtil alone is 753 LOC with 46 methods and WMC 200, and StringUtil is 283 LOC with 29 methods and WMC 72; those two classes account for ~1,036 LOC (>50% of the package LOC). Additional mid‑sized classes (FileUtil 132 LOC, UserInterfaceUtil 144 LOC) further increase the package's bulk. The package also has high afferent coupling (Ca = 40), meaning many parts of the system depend on it, amplifying the impact of its size. Taken together — large total LOC, heavy concentration in very large classes (high method counts and complexity), and many dependents — this indicates an excessively large component (God Component)."
