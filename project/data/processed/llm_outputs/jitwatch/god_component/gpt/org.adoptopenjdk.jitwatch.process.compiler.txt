    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with a total of 195 LOC (avg ~28 LOC/class). No single class dominates the package: the largest class is CompilerScala at 48 LOC (WMC 10), while other classes are 28–31 LOC with low complexity. There is no high fan-in/fan-out or large aggregated size that would indicate an excessively large component. Based on these metrics and the distributed, small-sized classes, this package does not qualify as a God Component."
