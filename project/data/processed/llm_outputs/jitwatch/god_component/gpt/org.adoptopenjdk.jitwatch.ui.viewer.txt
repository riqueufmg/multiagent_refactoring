    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.viewer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 79 LOC (num_classes=3, loc=79), with individual class sizes of 19, 27, and 33 LOC. Weighted methods/complexity (wmc) values are low (2, 5, 6), and class-level fanin/fanout are 0. There is no evidence of an excessively large single component either by lines of code or by number of classes; coupling metrics (Ce=4, Ca=1) are modest. Based on these figures, this package does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
