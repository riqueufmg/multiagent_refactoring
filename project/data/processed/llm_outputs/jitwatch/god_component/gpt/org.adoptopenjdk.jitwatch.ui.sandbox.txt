    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is excessively large and concentrated: total LOC = 1257 across only 6 classes, with two very large classes (SandboxConfigStage: 475 LOC, SandboxStage: 451 LOC) that together account for ~73% of the package LOC. Those classes also show very high complexity (WMC 85 and 97) and many methods (nom 37 and 43), indicating multiple responsibilities bundled into few classes. The package has wide external dependencies (Ce = 12 and listed dependent packages), suggesting it is highly coupled and central. The combination of high LOC concentration, large complex classes, many methods, and broad coupling supports detecting a God Component smell."
