    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 129 LOC (TopListStage: 110 LOC, TopListWrapper: 19 LOC). Although TopListStage shows moderate complexity (wmc 16, nom 9, nopm 6), the overall size and class count are small and do not indicate an excessively large component. Dependency counts are modest (Ce=4, Ca=1). Based on these elements, there is insufficient evidence of an excessively large (god) component."
