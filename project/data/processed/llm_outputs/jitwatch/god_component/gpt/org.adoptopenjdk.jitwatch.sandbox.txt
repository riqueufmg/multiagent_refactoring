    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is dominated by a single class (num_classes=1) whose size is large (loc=258). The Sandbox class shows high complexity (wmc=52), many members (nof=13, nom=11) and multiple responsibilities implied by numerous external dependencies (Ce=10) across many subsystems (parser, process, util, model, jvmlang, logger, etc.). Low incoming coupling (Ca=1) plus the concentration of code and dependencies in one class indicates the package centralizes excessive functionality, consistent with a God Component."
