    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes and 229 LOC total, which is modest. Individual classes are small (LOC 32–48) and have low complexity (WMC 7–10) and low coupling (fanin/fanout 0). There is no single class that dominates size or responsibility, and the package dependencies are limited (loader, logger, process.compiler). Based on these metrics and the distribution of responsibilities (separate Runtime* classes and a small IRuntime interface), the component is not excessively large and does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
