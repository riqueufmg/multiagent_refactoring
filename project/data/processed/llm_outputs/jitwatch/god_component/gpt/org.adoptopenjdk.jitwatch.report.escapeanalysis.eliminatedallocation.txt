    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class and is very small: num_classes = 1 and total loc = 8. The class (EliminatedAllocationWalker) has only 2 methods (nom = 2), low complexity (wmc = 2), few public members (nopm = 1) and no incoming/outgoing internal fans (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Although there are a couple of external dependencies (Ce = 2, Ca = 1) and a DIT of 4, the absolute size and class count do not indicate an excessively large component. Therefore, based on the provided data, this package is not a God Component."
