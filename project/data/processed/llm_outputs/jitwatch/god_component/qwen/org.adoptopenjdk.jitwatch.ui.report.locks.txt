    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a total of 105 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The classes themselves are also reasonably sized (69 and 36 LOC respectively), and there is no indication of excessive complexity or responsibility concentration that would suggest a God Component."
