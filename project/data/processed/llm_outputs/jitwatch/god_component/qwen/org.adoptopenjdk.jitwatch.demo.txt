    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class (MakeHotSpotLog) with 331 lines of code and 39 methods. While the class has a substantial size, it is not excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of classes to qualify as a God Component. The package-level metrics show reasonable complexity without indicating the extreme size that would characterize a God Component."
