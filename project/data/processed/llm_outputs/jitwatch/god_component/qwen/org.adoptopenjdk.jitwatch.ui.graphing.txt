    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes with a total of 590 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, AbstractGraphStage, has 199 lines of code and 19 methods, which is also not excessively large. The package has a reasonable number of dependencies (5) and is not overly complex in terms of class interactions or method counts."
