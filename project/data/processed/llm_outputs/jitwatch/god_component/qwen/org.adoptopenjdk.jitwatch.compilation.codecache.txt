    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a total of 88 lines of code, which is not excessively large. Neither of the classes shows indicators of being overly complex or handling too many responsibilities. The CodeCacheEventWalker has 4 methods and 44 lines of code, and CodeCacheWalkerResult also has 8 methods and 44 lines of code. The package and class sizes are within reasonable limits, and there is no evidence of excessive centralization of functionality or responsibilities."
