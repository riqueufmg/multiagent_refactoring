    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a total of 228 lines of code. The primary class 'CompileChainStage' has 224 lines of code and 13 methods, which is not excessively large in the context of UI components that often encapsulate significant functionality. The class count and lines of code are proportionate to the responsibilities handled, including UI rendering, event handling, and integration with other components. There is no indication of excessive centralization of logic or responsibilities that would characterize a God Component."
