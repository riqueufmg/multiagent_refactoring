    "justification": "The package contains only one class (AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker) with 65 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The class has moderate complexity (WMC=14, NOM=6) and does not exhibit signs of taking on too many responsibilities. The package-level metrics also indicate a small and focused component."
