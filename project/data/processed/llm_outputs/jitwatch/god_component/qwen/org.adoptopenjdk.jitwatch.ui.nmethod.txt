    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a combined LOC of 259, which is not excessively large. Neither of the classes shows indicators of being overly complex or handling too many responsibilities. The metrics such as WMC, NOM, and NOF for each class are within reasonable limits, and there is no evidence of the package being a central point of control or dependency within the system."
