    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only one class (SuggestionWalker) with 310 lines of code and 10 methods. While the class has a moderate size, it does not exhibit excessive complexity or responsibilities that would indicate a God Component. The number of dependencies is reasonable, and there is no evidence of the class being overly large in the context of its functionality."
