    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 249 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, J9Line, has 143 LOC and 19 methods, but this is still within reasonable limits for a single class. There is no indication that any single component is taking on too many responsibilities or is disproportionately large compared to the rest of the system."
