    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 7 classes with a total of 229 lines of code. Each class is relatively small, with the largest being RuntimeJava at 48 LOC and others ranging from 5 to 45 LOC. The complexity metrics (WMC, DIT, LCOM) are low to moderate, indicating no single class dominates the design. There's no evidence of excessive size or responsibility concentration that would indicate a God Component."
