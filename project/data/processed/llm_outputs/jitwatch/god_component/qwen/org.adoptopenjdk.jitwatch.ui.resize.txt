    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a total of 51 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The classes RateLimitedResizeListener and IRedrawable have modest size and complexity, with the largest class having 48 lines of code and 10 weighted method count. There is no indication of excessive responsibility or size that would classify this as a God Component."
