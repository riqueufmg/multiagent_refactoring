    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 79 lines of code, which is not excessively large. None of the individual classes exceed typical size thresholds for raising a God Component concern. The complexity and dependency metrics do not indicate centralization of functionality or excessive responsibility in a single component."
