    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes with a total of 1257 lines of code. While some individual classes like SandboxConfigStage (475 LOC) and SandboxStage (451 LOC) are large, the overall package size and class count do not indicate an excessively large component. The complexity is distributed across multiple cohesive classes, each handling distinct responsibilities within the sandbox UI functionality."
