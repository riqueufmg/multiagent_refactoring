    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class with 41 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The class has a manageable number of methods (4) and fields (1), and the overall complexity (WMC=8) is low. There is no indication of excessive responsibilities or disproportionate size that would classify this as a God Component."
