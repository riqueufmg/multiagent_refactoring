    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 93 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The classes have manageable size and complexity (e.g., loc ranges from 20 to 37, wmc from 4 to 9), and there is no indication of excessive responsibilities or centralization of functionality that would characterize a God Component."
