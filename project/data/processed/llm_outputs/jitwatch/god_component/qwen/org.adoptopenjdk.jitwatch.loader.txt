    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class, BytecodeLoader, which is excessively large with 541 lines of code and 25 methods. This class also has a high weighted method count (WMC) of 119, indicating high complexity. The package as a whole has only 4 classes but the dominant size and complexity of BytecodeLoader suggests it carries excessive responsibility, which are key indicators of a God Component."
