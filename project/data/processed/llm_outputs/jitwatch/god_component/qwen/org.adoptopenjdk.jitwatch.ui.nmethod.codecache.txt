    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only one class (CodeCacheLayoutStage) with 291 lines of code. While the class has a relatively high number of fields (20) and methods (18), and a moderate WMC (46), its size and complexity are not excessive enough to qualify as a God Component given the context of a single-class package responsible for UI-related functionality."
