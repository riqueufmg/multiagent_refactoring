    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 11 classes with a total of 1047 lines of code. While some individual classes like AssemblyReference (216 LOC) and AssemblyInstruction (178 LOC) are relatively large, the overall distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable given the domain complexity. No single class dominates the package in terms of functionality or LOC, and the classes seem to represent distinct concepts within the assembly model."
