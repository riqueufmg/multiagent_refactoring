    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.cell",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 5 classes with a total of 124 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, MemberTableCell, has 48 lines of code and 6 fields, which is also not indicative of a God Component. There is no evidence of excessive complexity or centralization of functionality that would suggest this package is a God Component."
