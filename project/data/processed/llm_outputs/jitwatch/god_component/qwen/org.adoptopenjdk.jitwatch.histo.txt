    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with a total of 239 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, InlineSizeHistoVisitable, has 94 LOC and a WMC of 17, which is manageable. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable across the classes, with no single class dominating the functionality or LOC count excessively."
