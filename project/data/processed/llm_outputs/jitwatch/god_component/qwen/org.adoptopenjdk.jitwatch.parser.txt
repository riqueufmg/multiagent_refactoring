    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 5 classes with a total of 424 lines of code. The largest class, AbstractLogParser, has 374 lines of code and 35 methods, which is substantial but not excessively large in the context of a parsing component. The package does not exhibit excessive size in terms of class count or lines of code that would indicate a God Component."
