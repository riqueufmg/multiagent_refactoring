    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a combined LOC of 228, which is not excessively large. The class sizes (111 and 117 LOC) and method counts (19 and 5 respectively) are moderate. There is no indication of excessive complexity or responsibility concentration that would suggest a God Component."
