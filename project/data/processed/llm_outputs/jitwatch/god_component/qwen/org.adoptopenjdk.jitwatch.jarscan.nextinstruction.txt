    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 84 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The class sizes are also modest, with the largest class (NextInstructionOperation) having 55 lines of code and 5 methods. There is no indication of excessive complexity or centralization of functionality that would suggest a God Component."
