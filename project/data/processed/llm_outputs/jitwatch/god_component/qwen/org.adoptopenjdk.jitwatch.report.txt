    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 99 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, Report, has 80 lines of code and 12 methods, which also does not indicate an excessively large component. There is no evidence of the package being responsible for too many functionalities or having excessive complexity that would characterize a God Component."
