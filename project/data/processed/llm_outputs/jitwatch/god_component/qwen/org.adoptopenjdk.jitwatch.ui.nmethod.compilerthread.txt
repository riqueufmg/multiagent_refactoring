    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single dominant class 'CompilerThreadStage' with 467 LOC out of the total package LOC of 487, indicating excessive concentration of functionality. The class has a high number of fields (17), methods (28), and a complex WMC of 77, suggesting it handles too many responsibilities. The package has only 3 classes, but one class overwhelmingly dominates in size and complexity, which aligns with the God Component smell."
