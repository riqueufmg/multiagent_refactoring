    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a total of 140 lines of code. The largest class, StageManager, has 137 lines of code and 15 methods, which is not excessively large in the context of a UI management component. The package does not exhibit excessive size in terms of lines of code or number of classes that would indicate a God Component smell."
