    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "(default package)",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 104 classes and has a total of 42,742 lines of code. One class, CodeCacheBuster, is excessively large with 20,010 lines of code and 5,001 methods, contributing significantly to the overall size and complexity of the component. This concentration of functionality in a single class, along with the overall package size, indicates a God Component smell."
