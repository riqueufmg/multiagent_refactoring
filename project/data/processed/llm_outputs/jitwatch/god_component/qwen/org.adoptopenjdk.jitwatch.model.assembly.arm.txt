    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 6 classes with a total of 328 lines of code. The largest class, AssemblyParserARM, has 214 lines of code and 56 WMC, which is not excessively large in the context of the entire package. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable for a specialized assembly parsing module."
