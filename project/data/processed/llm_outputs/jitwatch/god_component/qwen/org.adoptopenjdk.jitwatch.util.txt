    "justification": "The package contains 17 classes with a total of 1880 lines of code. While some classes like ParseUtil (753 LOC, 46 methods) and StringUtil (283 LOC, 29 methods) are relatively large, the overall distribution of functionality across multiple cohesive classes does not indicate a single excessively large component. The package serves as a utility layer with focused responsibilities per class, and no single class dominates the codebase to an excessive degree."
