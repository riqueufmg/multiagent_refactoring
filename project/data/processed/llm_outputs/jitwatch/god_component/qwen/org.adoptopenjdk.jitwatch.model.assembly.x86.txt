    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.x86",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 215 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, AssemblyParserX86, has 160 lines of code and 37 weighted method count, which while significant, does not indicate an excessively large component. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable across the classes, and there is no indication of excessive centralization of functionality or dependencies that would suggest a God Component."
