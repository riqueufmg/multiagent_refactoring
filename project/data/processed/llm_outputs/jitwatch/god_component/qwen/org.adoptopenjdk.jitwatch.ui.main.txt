    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 12 classes with a total of 1706 lines of code. The class JITWatchUI is excessively large with 983 lines of code, 74 fields, and 79 methods, indicating it centralizes too much functionality. The package also exhibits high afferent (17) and efferent (28) coupling, suggesting it acts as a hub managing numerous dependencies, which aligns with the characteristics of a God Component."
