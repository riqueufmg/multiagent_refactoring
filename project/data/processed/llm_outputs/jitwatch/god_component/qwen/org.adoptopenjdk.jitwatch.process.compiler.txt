    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with a total of 195 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The classes are focused on specific compiler implementations (e.g., CompilerJava, CompilerScala) and implement a common interface (ICompiler), indicating a well-organized design rather than a single monolithic component."
