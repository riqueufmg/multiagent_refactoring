    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes with a total of 246 lines of code. The largest class, CompilationUtil, has 224 lines of code and a WMC of 54, which is relatively high but not excessively so given its utility role. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable across the classes, and there is no indication of excessive centralization of logic or responsibilities in a single component."
