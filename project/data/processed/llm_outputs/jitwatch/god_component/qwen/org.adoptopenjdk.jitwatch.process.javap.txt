    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a combined LOC of 140, which is not excessively large. The classes JavapProcess (46 LOC) and ReflectionJavap (94 LOC) have manageable sizes and complexity (WMC of 9 and 12 respectively), and there is no indication of excessive responsibilities or dependencies that would classify this as a God Component."
