    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class with 48 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The class has a manageable number of methods (6) and functions (4), indicating it has a focused responsibility. There are no indicators of excessive complexity or disproportionate functionality that would suggest this is a God Component."
