    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 29 classes with a total of 2474 lines of code. While the package is sizable, the classes are functionally cohesive and model-related, suggesting a well-defined domain. No single class dominates the codebase in terms of size or responsibility. The distribution of lines of code and responsibilities across multiple classes indicates that the package is not a God Component."
