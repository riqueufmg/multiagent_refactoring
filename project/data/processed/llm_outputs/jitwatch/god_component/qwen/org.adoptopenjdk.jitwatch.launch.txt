    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.launch",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a total of 159 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The class LaunchHeadless has 152 lines of code and 30 weighted method complexity, which while substantial, does not indicate a God Component given the context of the system and its responsibilities. The dependencies are numerous but align with the launch functionality, suggesting appropriate coupling rather than excessive complexity or size."
