    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 22 classes with a total of 1547 lines of code. While the BytecodeAnnotationBuilder class is relatively large (474 LOC and WMC of 97), the overall distribution of responsibilities across multiple cohesive classes suggests that no single component is excessively large or承担过多职责. The package's structure indicates a well-organized domain model for bytecode handling rather than a god component."
