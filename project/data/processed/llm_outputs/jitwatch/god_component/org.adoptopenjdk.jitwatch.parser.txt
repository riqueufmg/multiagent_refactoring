    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package has 5 classes and 424 LOC but one class, AbstractLogParser, contains 374 LOC (~88% of package LOC), 35 methods (nom), and a very high WMC (80). This concentration of size and complexity in a single class (many methods, high complexity and many dependencies) indicates the component is doing too much and exhibits God Component characteristics."
