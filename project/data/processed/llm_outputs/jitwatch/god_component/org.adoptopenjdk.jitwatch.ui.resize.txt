    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 51 LOC (RateLimitedResizeListener: 48 LOC; IRedrawable: 3 LOC). There are no package-level dependencies and low coupling (Ce=0, Ca=3). Although RateLimitedResizeListener has WMC=10, the overall size and class count are small, so the component is not excessively large and does not qualify as a God Component."
