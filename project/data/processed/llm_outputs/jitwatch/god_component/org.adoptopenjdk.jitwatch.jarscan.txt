    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is dominated by a single large class: JarScan contains 303 of the package's 307 LOC (≈99%), has high complexity (WMC=60), many methods (nom=14) and fields (nof=12). The package only has 2 classes total, so functionality is concentrated in one class. JarScan also depends on numerous operation classes (freqinlinesize, sequencecount, methodsizehisto, allocationcount, sequencesearch, invokecount, nextinstruction, instructioncount, methodlength, BytecodeLoader), indicating it orchestrates many responsibilities. Efferent coupling Ce=11 with Ca=0 further suggests the component is doing much outward work but is not a cohesive, reused module. These factors indicate an excessive concentration of code/responsibility consistent with a God Component."
