    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 5 classes and 125 LOC overall, which is small for a 'God Component'. Although ReportStage is the largest class (86 LOC, WMC 19, NOM 5) and concentrates most functionality, the remainder of classes are tiny (21, 15, 2, 1 LOC). There is no large number of classes nor a very high total LOC indicating an excessively large component. Coupling values (Ce=9, Ca=1) show dependencies but not overwhelming component size. Therefore the available data do not support labeling this package as a God Component."
