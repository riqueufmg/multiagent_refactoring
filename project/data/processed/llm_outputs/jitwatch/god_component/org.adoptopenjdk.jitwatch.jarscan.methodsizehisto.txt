    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.methodsizehisto",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Package contains a single class (MethodSizeHistoOperation) with 41 LOC, low class count (1), modest complexity (WMC=8), no fanout and limited dependencies. These metrics indicate the component is small and focused, not excessively large in lines of code or number of classes, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
