    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.inline",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 251 LOC overall, with the largest class (HeadlessInlineVisitor) at 144 LOC and two small inner/support classes (75 LOC and 32 LOC). Method and complexity metrics are moderate (HeadlessInlineVisitor: nom=4, wmc=9) and the classes are closely related (inner visitor and failure-info classes), indicating cohesive responsibilities. External coupling is low (Ce=2, Ca=1, fanin/fanout ~0). Given the small number of classes, modest size, and focused responsibilities, this package does not exhibit the excessive size or class count characteristic of a God Component."
