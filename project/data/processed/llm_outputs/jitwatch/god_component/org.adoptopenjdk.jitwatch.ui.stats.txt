    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stats",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 74 lines of code in total, which is small for a component. The largest class (StatsStage) is 42 LOC with modest complexity (wmc=3, nom=3). Other classes are 15 and 17 LOC. Coupling metrics are low (Ce=3, Ca=1) and individual class fan-in/fan-out are zero in the provided data. Given the small size and low coupling, there is no evidence that this package is excessively large or acts as a God Component."
