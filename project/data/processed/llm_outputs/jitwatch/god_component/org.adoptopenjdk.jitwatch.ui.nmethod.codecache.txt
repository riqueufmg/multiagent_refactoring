    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.codecache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (num_classes=1) with 291 LOC. While the class CodeCacheLayoutStage shows some complexity (nom=18, wmc=46, nof=20), the package is not large in terms of number of classes nor overwhelmingly large in LOC for a component. Coupling figures (Ce=4, Ca=1) and single-class composition indicate concentration of functionality in one class but not an excessively large component by package-level size; therefore it does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
