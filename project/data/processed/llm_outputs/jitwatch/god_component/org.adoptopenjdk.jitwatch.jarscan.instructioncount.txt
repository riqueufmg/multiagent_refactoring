    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class and 48 LOC, which is small in both class count and size. The single class (InstructionCountOperation) has modest complexity (wmc=9, nom=5, loc=48) and no external fan-in/fan-out reported. There is no evidence of an excessively large component by lines of code or number of classes."
