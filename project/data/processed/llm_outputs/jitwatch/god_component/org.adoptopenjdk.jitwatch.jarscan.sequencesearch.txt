    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencesearch",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 164 LOC, which is small in terms of both class count and overall size. The largest class (SequenceSearchOperation) is 116 LOC with WMC=35 indicating some concentrated complexity, but this single moderately complex class does not make the package excessively large. Dependencies are limited (Ce=2, Ca=1). Given the low number of classes and modest total LOC, there is insufficient evidence to consider this package a God Component."
