    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 131 LOC (InstructionSequence: 26 LOC; SequenceCountOperation: 105 LOC). Although SequenceCountOperation holds most of the logic (nom=10, wmc=34), the overall package size and class count are small and do not constitute an excessively large component. Coupling is low (few external dependencies, Ce=1, Ca=3) and fan-in/fan-out are zero at class level, further indicating this is not a God Component."
