    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "(default package)",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 104 classes and 42,742 LOC, indicating a very large component by class count and size. Critically, a single class, CodeCacheBuster, has 20,010 LOC and 5,001 methods (WMC 5,002), which alone comprises roughly 47% of the package LOC and an extreme method count. This pronounced concentration of code and the high overall class count justify detecting a God Component: the component is excessively large both in total LOC and because it contains at least one overwhelmingly large class."
