    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with total 259 lines of code. The larger class (ViewerAssembly) has 249 LOC and 15 methods, which represents typical UI view complexity rather than excessive size. The metrics do not indicate an excessively large component in terms of class count or overall code volume within this context."
