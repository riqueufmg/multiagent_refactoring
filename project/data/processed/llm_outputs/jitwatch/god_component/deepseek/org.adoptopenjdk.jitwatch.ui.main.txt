    "justification": "The JITWatchUI class dominates the package with 983 LOC (57% of total package LOC), 74 fields, 79 methods, and 174 weighted method complexity, indicating excessive responsibility concentration. While the package has 12 classes (moderate count), the disproportionate size and complexity of one class creates a focal point of excessive functionality."
