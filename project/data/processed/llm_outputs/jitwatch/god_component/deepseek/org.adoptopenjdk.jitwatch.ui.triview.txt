    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes with 1468 total lines of code, showing a moderate size. While one class (TriView) is large at 751 LOC, the overall package metrics do not indicate excessive size. The package's dependencies (Ce=12, Ca=5) suggest moderate coupling, and the classes are mostly small with focused responsibilities."
