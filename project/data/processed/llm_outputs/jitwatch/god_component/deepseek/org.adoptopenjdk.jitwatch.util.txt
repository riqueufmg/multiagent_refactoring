    "justification": "The package contains 17 classes and 1880 LOC, which is moderately sized for a utility package. While one class (ParseUtil) is large (753 LOC, 46 methods), the overall package does not appear excessively large in terms of total classes or aggregate LOC. Most other classes are small to moderate in size, and the package's responsibilities appear to be appropriately distributed across multiple utility classes."
