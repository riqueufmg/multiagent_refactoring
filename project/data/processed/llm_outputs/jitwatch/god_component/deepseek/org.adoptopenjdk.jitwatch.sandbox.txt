    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only one class with 258 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The class has moderate complexity (52 WMC, 13 fields, 11 methods) and cohesive design (LCOM 0.0). While it has multiple dependencies, the overall size doesn't indicate a God Component given the single-class structure."
