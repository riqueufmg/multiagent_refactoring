    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes with 1257 total LOC, which is moderate. Individual classes show reasonable size distribution with SandboxStage (451 LOC) and SandboxConfigStage (475 LOC) being the largest, but none exhibit excessive size or complexity that would indicate a God Component. The package has focused cohesion around sandbox UI functionality."
