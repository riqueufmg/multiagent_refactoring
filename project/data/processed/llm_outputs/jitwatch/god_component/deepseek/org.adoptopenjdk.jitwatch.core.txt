    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package exhibits God Component due to the JITWatchConfig class (568 LOC, 86 methods) and JITWatchConstants class (296 LOC, 283 fields) being excessively large and complex, dominating the package's total size of 1071 LOC across 9 classes, indicating centralization of too many responsibilities."
