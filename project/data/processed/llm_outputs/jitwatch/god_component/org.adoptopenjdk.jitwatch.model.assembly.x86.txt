    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.x86",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 215 LOC overall, which is not excessively large for a component. Although one class (AssemblyParserX86) is relatively bigger (160 LOC, WMC 37, NOM 7), the other two classes are small (38 LOC and 17 LOC), so the package as a whole does not exhibit the excessive size in lines of code or number of classes typical of a God Component. Coupling metrics (Ce=1, Ca=2) do not indicate extreme dependency concentration either."
