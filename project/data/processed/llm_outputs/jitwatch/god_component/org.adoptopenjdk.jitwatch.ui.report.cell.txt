    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.cell",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package is small and does not exhibit an excessive size: only 5 classes and 124 LOC in total. The largest class (MemberTableCell) is 48 LOC; other classes are 30, 20, 13, 13 LOC. Complexity metrics are low (WMC up to 7), fanin/fanout are zero for listed classes, and the package dependencies are limited. There is no evidence of a single, disproportionately large or complex component, so this does not qualify as a God Component."
