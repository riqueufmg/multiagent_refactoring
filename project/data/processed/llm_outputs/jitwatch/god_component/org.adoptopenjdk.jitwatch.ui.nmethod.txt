    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 259 total LOC, with individual class sizes of 154 LOC and 105 LOC. Method counts (12 and 11) and WMC values (15 each) indicate moderate per-class complexity, not extreme. Coupling metrics are low (Ca=0, Ce=4) and fan-in/fan-out are 0. Given the small number of classes, modest total LOC, and limited coupling, there is insufficient evidence to consider this package an excessively large (God) component."
