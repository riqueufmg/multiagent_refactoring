    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 228 LOC in total, which is not excessively large for a component. Although CompileChainStage dominates the package (224 LOC, 13 methods, WMC=26, 16 fields) and shows concentrated responsibility/complexity, the package-level metrics (num_classes=2, loc=228) and the very small nested PlotNode (4 LOC) do not indicate an excessively large component. Therefore, based on the provided data, this package does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
