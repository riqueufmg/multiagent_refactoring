    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes but is heavily dominated by ViewerBytecode (276 of 286 LOC, ~96% of package LOC). ViewerBytecode has high complexity and size (loc=276, nom=17, wmc=60, nopm=10) and many external dependencies, indicating it aggregates multiple responsibilities. The other class (BytecodeLabel) is trivial (loc=10). The concentration of code, methods and dependencies in a single class within the package supports detecting a God Component: responsibilities are not well distributed across classes in the component."
