    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 22 classes and 1,547 LOC, indicating substantial size. Complexity is concentrated in a few very large classes: BytecodeAnnotationBuilder (474 LOC, WMC 97, dit=2), BytecodeInstruction (181 LOC, WMC 47), LineTable (151 LOC, WMC 37) and MemberBytecode (112 LOC, WMC 30). Several classes have high method counts and high complexity metrics (nom, wmc), showing multiple responsibilities centralized in the package. Additionally the package has high afferent coupling (Ca = 23) and low efferent coupling (Ce = 3), meaning many other components depend on it, increasing its central role. These factors (large total LOC, many classes with concentrated complexity, and high incoming dependencies) support classifying this package as a God Component."
