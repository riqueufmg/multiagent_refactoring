    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.escapeanalysis",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (num_classes = 1) with 65 LOC, which is small and does not indicate an excessively large component. Class metrics (loc = 65, wmc = 14, nom = 6) show moderate complexity but not a sprawling size; coupling metrics (Ca = 0, Ce = 3, fanin = 0, fanout = 0) do not indicate broad dependencies typical of a god component. Based on the provided data, there is no evidence of excessive lines of code or a large number of classes that would justify labeling this package a God Component."
