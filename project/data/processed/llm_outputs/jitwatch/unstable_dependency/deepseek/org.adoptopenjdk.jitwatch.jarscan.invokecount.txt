  "justification": "The analyzed package has a stability (I) value of 0.6667 (Ce=2, Ca=1). Its outgoing dependencies have lower I values: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (I=0.1136, Ce=5, Ca=39) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (I=0.12, Ce=3, Ca=22). Since both dependencies are more stable (lower I) than the analyzed package, the Stable Dependencies Principle is satisfied."
