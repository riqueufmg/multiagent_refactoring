The analyzed package's instability (0.5) is lower than the instability of both its dependencies (0.0943 and 0.6222). Since one dependency is more stable and the other is less stable, the overall condition for unstable dependency (depending on less stable components) is not met for both dependencies; the package depends on at least one more stable component."
