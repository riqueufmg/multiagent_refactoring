"justification": "The analyzed package has instability (I = 0.75), computed as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 3/(1+3). Its outgoing dependencies have lower instability values: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (I = 0.094), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (I = 0.114), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation (I = 0.25). All dependencies are more stable than the analyzed package, which follows the Stable Dependencies Principle."
