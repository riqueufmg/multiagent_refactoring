  "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "The analyzed package has instability I = 1.0 (Ce=11, Ca=0). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability values (e.g., org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode I=0.12, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.methodlength I=0.75), meaning they are more stable. Therefore, the analyzed package does not depend on any less stable component."
