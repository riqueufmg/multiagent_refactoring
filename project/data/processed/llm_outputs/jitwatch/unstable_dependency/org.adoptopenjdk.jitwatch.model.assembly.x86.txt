"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.x86 has Ce=1 and Ca=2 (stability I = 2/(2+1) = 0.667). It has an outgoing dependency to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly which has Ce=4 and Ca=7 (stability I = 7/(7+4) = 0.636). Because assembly.x86 depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly which is less stable (0.636 < 0.667), this violates the Stable Dependencies Principle and indicates an Unstable Dependency smell. Incoming dependencies (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly) do not negate the fact that its outgoing dependency is to a less stable package."
