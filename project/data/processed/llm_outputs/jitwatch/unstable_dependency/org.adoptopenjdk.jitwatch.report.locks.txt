"justification": "The analyzed package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.locks has Ce=2, Ca=1 (instability I=2/(1+2)=0.667). Its outgoing dependencies are org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (Ce=3, Ca=22, I=3/(3+22)=0.12) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I=5/(5+48)=0.094). Both dependencies are substantially more stable (lower instability) than the analyzed package, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected. Although there is an incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17, I=28/(28+17)=0.622), incoming dependencies do not cause an unstable dependency smell for this package."
