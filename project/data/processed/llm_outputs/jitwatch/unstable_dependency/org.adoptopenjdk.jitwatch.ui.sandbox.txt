"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The analyzed package has Ce=12 and Ca=2 (stability I = 2/(2+12) ≈ 0.143). It has an outgoing dependency on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox which has Ce=10 and Ca=1 (stability I = 1/(1+10) ≈ 0.091), i.e. sandbox is less stable than org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox. By the Stable Dependencies Principle a package should depend only on packages more stable than itself; depending on the less stable org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell. (For reference, other outgoing dependencies are more stable: core I≈0.813, loader I≈0.583, parser I≈0.625, ui.filechooser I≈0.667, process I≈0.667, jvmlang I≈0.429, model I≈0.906, ui.stage I≈0.400, ui I≈0.750, util I≈0.886, ui.main I≈0.378.)"
