"detection": true,
"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode has Ce=3 and Ca=22 (stability = 22/(22+3) = 0.88). One of its outgoing dependencies, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation, has Ce=3 and Ca=9 (stability = 9/(9+3) = 0.75), which is less stable than org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode. This means the analyzed package (relatively stable) depends on a less stable package, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. The other outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util: stability ≈0.886, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model: stability ≈0.906) are more stable, so the detected unstable dependency is specifically the dependency on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation."
