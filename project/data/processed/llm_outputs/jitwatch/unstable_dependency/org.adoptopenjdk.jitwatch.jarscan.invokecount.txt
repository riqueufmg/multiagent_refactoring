"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=2, Ca=1 -> instability I=2/(2+1)=0.667. Outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (Ce=3, Ca=22 -> I=3/(3+22)=0.120) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39 -> I=5/(5+39)=0.114). Both outgoing dependencies have much lower instability (are more stable) than the analyzed package, so the package depends on more stable components as required by the Stable Dependencies Principle. Incoming dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan (Ce=11, Ca=0 -> I=1.0) depends on the analyzed package but does not cause the analyzed package to depend on less-stable components. Therefore there is no Unstable Dependency smell for this package."
