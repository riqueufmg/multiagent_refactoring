"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.filechooser has Ce=1 (outgoing dependency to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util) and Ca=2 (incoming from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main). Its instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 1/(2+1) = 0.333. The depended-on package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util has Ce=5, Ca=39, instability I = 5/(39+5) ≈ 0.114, i.e. it is more stable. Since filechooser's only outgoing dependency is to a more stable package, the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
