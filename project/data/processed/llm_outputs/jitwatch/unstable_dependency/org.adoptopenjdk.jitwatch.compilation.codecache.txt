"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has Ce=1 and Ca=2 (stability I = 2/(2+1) ≈ 0.667). Its only outgoing dependency is org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model which has Ce=5 and Ca=48 (stability I = 48/(48+5) ≈ 0.906). Since the analyzed package depends on a more stable package (dependency I 0.906 > package I 0.667), the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected. Incoming dependencies from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.codecache (two afferents) do not create an unstable dependency for this package."
