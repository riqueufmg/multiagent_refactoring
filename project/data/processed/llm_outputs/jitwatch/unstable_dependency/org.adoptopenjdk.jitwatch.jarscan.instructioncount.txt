"justification": "Analyzed package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.instructioncount has Ce=1, Ca=1 (instability I=1/(1+1)=0.5). Its single outgoing dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode has Ce=3, Ca=22 (I=3/(3+22)≈0.12), i.e. significantly more stable than the analyzed package. There is an incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan with Ce=11, Ca=0 (I=1.0), but incoming/afferent dependencies do not cause the unstable-dependency smell for this package. Because the package only depends on a more stable package, the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
