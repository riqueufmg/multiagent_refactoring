"justification": "Analyzed package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.codecache has Ce=4 and Ca=1, instability I = 4/(4+1) = 0.8. Its outgoing dependencies and their instabilities: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39, I ≈ 0.114), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.codecache (Ce=1, Ca=2, I = 0.333), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I ≈ 0.094), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17, I ≈ 0.622). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than the analyzed package (0.8), so the Stable Dependencies Principle is satisfied. Additionally the analyzed package has only one incoming dependency (Ca=1 from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main), so it is not heavily depended upon. Therefore there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
