  "justification": "Analyzed package has Ce=4, Ca=0 => instability I = 4/(4+0) = 1.0 (very unstable). All outgoing dependencies are to packages with lower instability (i.e., more stable): org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize (Ce=0, Ca=3, I=0.0), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39, I=5/44 ≈ 0.114), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I=5/53 ≈ 0.094), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17, I=28/45 ≈ 0.622). Because each dependency's instability is less than the analyzed package's instability, the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
