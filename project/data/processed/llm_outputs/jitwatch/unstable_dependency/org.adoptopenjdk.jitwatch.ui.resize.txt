"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize",
"detection": false,
"justification": "No unstable dependency detected because org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize has no outgoing dependencies (Ce=0) and thus does not depend on any less-stable packages. Its afferent coupling is Ca=3, giving stability I = Ca/(Ca+Ce) = 3/(3+0) = 1.0 (very stable). The incoming dependents are less stable: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod (Ce=4, Ca=0, I=0.0), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing (Ce=5, Ca=1, I≈0.167), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain (Ce=6, Ca=1, I≈0.143). Because the package is stable and other, less-stable packages depend on it (incoming dependencies) rather than it depending on them, the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated."
