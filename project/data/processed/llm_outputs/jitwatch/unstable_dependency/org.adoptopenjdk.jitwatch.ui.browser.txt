Its outgoing dependency is org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39 -> I=5/(5+39)≈0.114), which is more stable than the analyzed package. Incoming dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17 -> I=28/(28+17)≈0.622) is less stable but is an incoming dependency (others depend on this package), not an outgoing dependency. Because the package does not depend on less stable packages, the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
