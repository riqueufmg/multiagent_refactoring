"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage has Ce=3, Ca=2 => instability I = 3/(2+3) = 0.60. Its outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39 => I ≈ 0.114), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48 => I ≈ 0.094), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17 => I ≈ 0.622). The Stable Dependencies Principle requires a package to depend only on packages that are more stable (lower I) than itself. org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main has higher instability (0.622) than org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage (0.60), so ui.stage depends on a less stable package. Additionally, ui.main lists ui.stage as a dependency (mutual dependency/cycle), which reinforces instability. These facts justify detection of the Unstable Dependency smell."
