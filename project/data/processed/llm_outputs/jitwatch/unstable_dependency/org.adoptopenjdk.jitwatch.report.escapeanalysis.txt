"justification": "The package has Ce=3 and Ca=0 (instability I = 0.00), i.e. it is an unstable/leaf package. Its outgoing dependencies are to packages that are significantly more stable: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report (Ce=2, Ca=11, I≈0.85), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (Ce=3, Ca=22, I≈0.88), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I≈0.91). There are no incoming dependencies. Because the package depends on more stable packages (direction follows the Stable Dependencies Principle), the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
