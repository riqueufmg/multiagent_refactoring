"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader has stability I = Ca/(Ca+Ce) = 7/(7+5) ≈ 0.583. It has outgoing dependencies to packages that are less stable: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang (Ca=3, Ce=4, I≈0.429) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.javap (Ca=1, Ce=1, I=0.5). Depending on these less-stable packages violates the Stable Dependencies Principle. Although some outgoing deps are more stable (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode I≈0.88, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model I≈0.906, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util I≈0.886), the presence of dependencies to jvmlang and process.javap (including a cyclic relation with process.javap) justifies flagging an Unstable Dependency smell."
