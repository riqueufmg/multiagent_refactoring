"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report has Ce=2, Ca=11 (instability I=2/(11+2)≈0.1538). Outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor (Ce=1, Ca=5, I=1/(1+5)≈0.1667) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I=5/(5+48)≈0.0943). Since report depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor which has higher instability (0.1667 > 0.1538), the Stable Dependencies Principle is violated. Additionally, report has many incoming dependencies (Ca=11), reinforcing that it is relatively stable and should not depend on less stable packages. Therefore an Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
