"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.j9",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The analyzed package has Ce=3 and Ca=0 (stability I = 0/(0+3) = 0.00), i.e. it is unstable. Its outgoing dependencies are to packages that are substantially more stable: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core (Ce=3, Ca=13, I=13/(13+3)=0.8125), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39, I=39/(39+5)=0.8864), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I=48/(48+5)=0.9057). Because the package depends on packages with higher stability values (direction of dependencies is toward more stable packages), the Stable Dependencies Principle is satisfied and there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
