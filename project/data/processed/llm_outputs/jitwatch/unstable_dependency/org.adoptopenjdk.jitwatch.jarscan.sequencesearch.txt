"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencesearch",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has Ce=2 and Ca=1 giving instability I = Ca/(Ca+Ce) = 1/3 ≈ 0.33. Its outgoing dependencies are org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (Ca=22, Ce=3, I = 22/25 = 0.88) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ca=48, Ce=5, I = 48/53 ≈ 0.91). Both dependency packages are substantially more stable than the analyzed package, so the package depends on more stable components, respecting the Stable Dependencies Principle. Although an incoming package (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan) is highly unstable (Ca=0, Ce=11, I=0), that is an incoming dependency and does not indicate this package depends on less stable components. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
