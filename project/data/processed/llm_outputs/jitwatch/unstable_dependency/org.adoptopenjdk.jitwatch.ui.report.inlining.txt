"justification": "Analyzed package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.inlining has Ce=2, Ca=1 (Instability I = 2/(1+2) ≈ 0.667). Its outgoing dependencies are org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report (Ce=2, Ca=11, I = 2/13 ≈ 0.154) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I = 5/53 ≈ 0.094). Both outgoing dependencies have significantly lower instability (are more stable) than the analyzed package, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is satisfied. The incoming dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report (Ce=9, Ca=1, I = 9/10 = 0.9) is more unstable and depends on this package, which does not indicate an unstable dependency from the analyzed package. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
