"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=4, Ca=1 -> Instability I_viewer = 4/(4+1) = 0.80. Outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I=5/53≈0.094), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39, I=5/44≈0.114), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview (Ce=12, Ca=5, I=12/17≈0.706), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17, I=28/45≈0.622). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability values (are more stable) than the analyzed package (0.094, 0.114, 0.706, 0.622 < 0.80), so the package does not depend on less stable components. Note: there is an incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (I≈0.622), indicating a cyclic relation, but that does not make org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.viewer itself violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected for this package."
