"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.methodlength",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has Ce=3 and Ca=1 -> Instability I = 1 - 3/(3+1) = 0.25 (relatively unstable). Its outgoing dependencies are:\n- org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48 -> I ≈ 0.91)\n- org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39 -> I ≈ 0.89)\n- org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (Ce=3, Ca=22 -> I = 0.88)\nAll outgoing dependencies have significantly higher stability indices than the analyzed package, so the package depends on more stable packages (complies with the Stable Dependencies Principle). The only incoming dependency shown is org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan (Ce=11, Ca=0 -> I = 0.0), an unstable package that depends on the analyzed package; this does not constitute an unstable dependency for the analyzed package. Therefore, the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
