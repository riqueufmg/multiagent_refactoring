"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=3, Ca=1 -> instability I = 3/(3+1) = 0.75. Outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39 -> I=0.114), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48 -> I=0.094), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17 -> I=0.622). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability than the analyzed package (0.114, 0.094, 0.622 < 0.75), so the package does not depend on less stable packages. Incoming dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (I=0.622) is more stable than the analyzed package, which is acceptable. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
