Outgoing dependencies and their instabilities: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model I = 5/(5+48) ≈ 0.094 (more stable), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util I = 5/(5+39) ≈ 0.114 (more stable), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist I = 6/(6+1) ≈ 0.857 (less stable), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main I = 28/(28+17) ≈ 0.622 (more stable). Because org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.toplist depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist which has a higher instability (0.857) than itself (0.80), the Stable Dependencies Principle is violated -> Unstable Dependency smell detected."
