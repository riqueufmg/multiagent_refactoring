"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core has Ce=3, Ca=13 => instability I=3/(3+13)=0.1875 (relatively stable). Its outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48 => I=5/53≈0.0943), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39 => I=5/44≈0.1136), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (Ce=3, Ca=22 => I=3/25=0.12). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (more stable) than the analyzed package, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected. Although many incoming dependents are relatively unstable, incoming dependencies do not cause an unstable-dependency smell for this package. Therefore no unstable dependency smell is detected."
