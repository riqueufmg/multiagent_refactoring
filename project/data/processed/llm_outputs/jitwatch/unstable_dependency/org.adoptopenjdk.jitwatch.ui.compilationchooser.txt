"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser",

"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser (Ce=2, Ca=2, stability=0.50) has an outgoing dependency to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17, stability=17/45≈0.3778) which is less stable than itself. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should depend only on packages more stable than itself; this violated dependency (0.50 -> 0.3778) constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell. Note: the package also depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (stability≈0.9057) which is more stable, but the presence of the dependency to the less stable ui.main triggers the smell."
