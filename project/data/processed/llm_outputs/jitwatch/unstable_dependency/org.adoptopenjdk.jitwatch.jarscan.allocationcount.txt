  "justification": "The analyzed package depends only on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode. Calculated instability (I = Ca / (Ca + Ce)): analyzed package I = 1/(1+1) = 0.5; org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode I = 22/(22+3) ≈ 0.88. Since the dependency goes from lower stability (0.5) to higher stability (0.88), the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and there is no unstable dependency. Incoming dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan has I = 0/(0+11) = 0.0 (very unstable) and depends on the analyzed package, which is acceptable. (Metrics: analyzed Ce=1 Ca=1; model.bytecode Ce=3 Ca=22; jarscan Ce=11 Ca=0.)"
