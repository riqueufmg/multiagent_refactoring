"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=1, Ca=1 => Instability I=1/(1+1)=0.50. Outgoing dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report (Ce=2, Ca=11 => I=2/(11+2)=0.1538). The analyzed package depends on a more stable package (0.1538 < 0.50), which follows the Stable Dependencies Principle, so there is no unstable-dependency smell. There is one incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report (Ce=9, Ca=1 => I=0.90), meaning a more unstable package depends on the analyzed package, but that does not indicate the analyzed package depends on less stable components. Therefore detection = false."
