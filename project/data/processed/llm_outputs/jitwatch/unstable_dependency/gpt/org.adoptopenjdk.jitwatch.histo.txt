"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo has Ce=3 and Ca=1 -> instability I = 3/(3+1) = 0.75. Its outgoing dependencies are: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor (Ce=1, Ca=5 -> I = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48 -> I = 5/53 ≈ 0.0943), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation (Ce=3, Ca=9 -> I = 3/12 = 0.25). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability values than org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo, so the package depends on more stable packages. Incoming dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing (Ca contribution = 1) is already reflected in Ca. Therefore the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
