Outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (Ce=3, Ca=22 => I=3/(3+22)=0.1200) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount (Ce=1, Ca=2 => I=1/(1+2)=0.3333). Both outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than the analyzed package, so the package does not depend on less stable components and the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected. Incoming dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan (Ce=11, Ca=0 => I=1.0) is more unstable but is an incoming dependency and does not cause this package to depend on less stable packages."
