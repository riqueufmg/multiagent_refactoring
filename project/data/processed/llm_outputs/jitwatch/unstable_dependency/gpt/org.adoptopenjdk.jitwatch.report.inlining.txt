"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.inlining",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The analyzed package has Ce=3, Ca=1 -> instability I = 0.75 (unstable). Outgoing dependencies point to more stable packages (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report: Ce=2, Ca=11 -> I≈0.15; org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode: Ce=3, Ca=22 -> I=0.12; org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model: Ce=5, Ca=48 -> I≈0.09), so its outgoing edges follow the Stable Dependencies Principle. However, there is an incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17 -> I≈0.62), which is more stable (lower I) than the analyzed package but depends on it. That means a more stable package depends on a less stable one, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore the unstable dependency smell is detected."
