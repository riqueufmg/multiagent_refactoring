Outgoing dependencies and their instabilities: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode I=0.12, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly I=0.364, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview I=0.706, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.x86 I=0.333, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm I=0.333, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util I=0.114, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main I=0.622. All outgoing dependencies have lower instability than the package (are more stable). Incoming dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview (I=0.706) depends on this package. Since the package depends only on packages that are more stable (lower I) than itself, the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated. Therefore Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
