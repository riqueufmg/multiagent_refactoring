Outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode stability = 22/(22+3) = 0.88; org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model stability = 48/(48+5) ≈ 0.906. Both outgoing targets are significantly more stable than the analyzed package, so the package does not depend on less stable components. Incoming dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main has stability = 17/(17+28) ≈ 0.378 (irrelevant for unstable-dependency detection, which examines outgoing dependencies). Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell detected."
