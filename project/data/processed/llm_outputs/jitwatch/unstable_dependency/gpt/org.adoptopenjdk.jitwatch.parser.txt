"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser has Ce=3, Ca=5 -> instability I=3/(3+5)=0.375. Its outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core (Ce=3, Ca=13 -> I=0.1875), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39 -> I≈0.1136), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48 -> I≈0.0943). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than the analyzed package, so the package is not depending on less stable components. Incoming dependents (e.g., org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.launch I=1.0, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main I≈0.622) are more unstable and depend on this package, which is consistent with the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
