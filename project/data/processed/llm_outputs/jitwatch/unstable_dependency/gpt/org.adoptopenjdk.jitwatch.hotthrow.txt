"justification": "Analyzed package instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 4/(1+4) = 0.80. Outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode I = 3/(22+3) = 0.12; org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model I = 5/(48+5) ≈ 0.094; org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation I = 3/(9+3) = 0.25; org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util I = 5/(39+5) ≈ 0.114. All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than the analyzed package, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected. There is an incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist (I = 6/(1+6) ≈ 0.857) but incoming dependencies do not create an unstable dependency smell for this package. Therefore no unstable dependency smell detected."
