"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler",
"detection": false,
"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=1, Ca=3 → instability = 1/(1+3) = 0.25. Outgoing dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger (Ce=0, Ca=6 → instability = 0/(0+6) = 0.00). The package depends only on logger, which is more stable (lower instability) than the analyzed package, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected for outgoing dependencies. Incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang: instability ≈0.57, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime: ≈0.60, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox: ≈0.91) indicate other, less stable packages depend on this package, which does not constitute an unstable dependency for the analyzed package. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell detected."
