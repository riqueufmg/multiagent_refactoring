"detection": false,
"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process has Ce=1 and Ca=2 (instability I = 1/(1+2) = 0.333). Its only outgoing dependency is org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger which has Ce=0 and Ca=6 (I = 0/(0+6) = 0.0). The process package therefore depends on a more stable package (logger), satisfying the Stable Dependencies Principle. Incoming dependents (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox: Ce=10, Ca=1, I≈0.909; org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox: Ce=12, Ca=2, I≈0.857) depend on the process package, but that does not indicate the process package has unstable dependencies. Consequently, no unstable dependency smell is detected."
