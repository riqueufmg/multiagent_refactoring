"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has Ce=1, Ca=2 => Instability I=1/(1+2)=0.333. It has an outgoing dependency on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly (Ce=4, Ca=7 => I=4/(4+7)=0.364). The dependency's instability (0.364) is greater than the analyzed package's instability (0.333), so the package depends on a less stable component, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
