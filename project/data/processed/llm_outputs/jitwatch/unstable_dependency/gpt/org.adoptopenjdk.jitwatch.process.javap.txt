"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.javap",
"detection": false,
"justification": "Analyzed package has Ce=1 and Ca=1 -> instability = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. It has an outgoing dependency to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader which has Ce=5 and Ca=7 -> instability = 5/(5+7) ≈ 0.417. Because the package depends on a more stable package (0.417 < 0.5), the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated; therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected. (Note: there is a mutual dependency between the two packages, but the dependency direction in question is towards the more stable package.)"
