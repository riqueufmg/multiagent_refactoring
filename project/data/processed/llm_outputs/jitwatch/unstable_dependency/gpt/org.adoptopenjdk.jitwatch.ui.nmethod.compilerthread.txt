Outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39 => I ≈ 0.114), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48 => I ≈ 0.094), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17 => I ≈ 0.622). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability values (are more stable) than the analyzed package (0.114, 0.094, 0.622 < 0.75), so the package does not depend on less stable packages. The incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (I ≈ 0.622) means a more stable package depends on this one, but that does not constitute this package depending on less stable components. Therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
