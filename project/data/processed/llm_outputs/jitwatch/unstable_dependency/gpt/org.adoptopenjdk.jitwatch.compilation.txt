"justification": "The package has Ce=3 and Ca=9 (stability I = 9/(9+3) = 0.75). Its outgoing dependencies are more stable: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor (Ca=5, Ce=1, I=5/6≈0.83), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ca=39, Ce=5, I=39/44≈0.89), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ca=48, Ce=5, I=48/53≈0.91). Because compilation depends on packages with higher stability than itself, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle and therefore does not exhibit an Unstable Dependency smell."
