"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has Ce=0 (no outgoing dependencies) and its dependencies list is empty, so it does not depend on any other packages. It has Ca=6 (incoming dependencies) from packages such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main, indicating it is relatively stable. Unstable Dependency occurs when a package depends on less stable packages; since this package has no outgoing dependencies and is depended upon by others, the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
