"justification": "Analyzed package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain has Ce=3 and Ca=1 (stability I = 1/(1+3) = 0.25). Its outgoing dependencies are more stable: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39, I = 39/44 ≈ 0.886), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I = 48/53 ≈ 0.904), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation (Ce=3, Ca=9, I = 9/12 = 0.75). All outgoing dependencies have higher stability values than the analyzed package, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected. The incoming dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain (Ce=6, Ca=1, I ≈ 0.143) is less stable but is an incoming caller and does not indicate that this package depends on less stable components. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
