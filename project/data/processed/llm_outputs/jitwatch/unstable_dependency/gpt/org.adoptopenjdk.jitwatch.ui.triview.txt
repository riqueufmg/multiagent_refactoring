"justification": "Analyzed package instability I = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 12/(12+5) = 0.706. It has outgoing dependencies to several packages that are less stable (higher instability) than itself: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly (Ce=7, Ca=1, I=7/8=0.875), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.bytecode (Ce=6, Ca=1, I=6/7≈0.857), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.source (Ce=3, Ca=1, I=3/4=0.75). Depending on these more-unstable packages violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, so the Unstable Dependency smell is detected. (Other outgoing dependencies such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core I=0.188, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model I≈0.094, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util I≈0.114, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main I≈0.622 are more stable or comparably stable.)"
