"justification": "Analyzed package has Ce=1, Ca=1 (Instability I = 1/(1+1) = 0.50). Its single outgoing dependency is org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser which has Ce=3, Ca=5 (I = 3/(3+5) = 0.375). Since the analyzed package depends on a more stable package (0.375 < 0.50), the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and there is no unstable dependency. Incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (I = 28/(28+17) = 0.622) is an afferent dependency (others depend on the analyzed package) and does not cause an unstable dependency smell for the analyzed package."
