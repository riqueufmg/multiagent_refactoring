"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has Ce=2, Ca=1 (instability I = 2/(1+2) = 0.667). Its outgoing dependencies are org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report (Ce=2, Ca=11, I = 2/13 ≈ 0.154) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I = 5/53 ≈ 0.094). Both targets are more stable (lower I) than the analyzed package, so dependencies point toward more stable packages as required by the Stable Dependency Principle. The incoming dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report (Ce=9, Ca=1, I = 0.9) is less stable and depends on this package, which is also acceptable. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
