"justification": "Package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic has Ce=2, Ca=2 (stability I=2/(2+2)=0.50). Its outgoing dependencies are org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I≈48/53≈0.906) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation (Ce=3, Ca=9, I=9/12=0.75) — both are more stable than intrinsic, so intrinsic depends on more stable packages. Incoming dependents are org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist (Ce=6, Ca=1, I≈0.143) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17, I≈0.378) — these are less stable and depend on intrinsic. Since dependency directions point toward greater stability (SDP respected), there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
