"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util has Ce=5, Ca=39 (instability I=0.1136). It has outgoing dependencies to: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core (Ce=3, Ca=13, I=0.1875), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader (Ce=5, Ca=7, I=0.4167), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (Ce=3, Ca=22, I=0.1200), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly (Ce=4, Ca=7, I=0.3636), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I=0.0943). Four of the five outgoing dependencies (core, loader, model.bytecode, model.assembly) have higher instability (I > 0.1136) than util, meaning util depends on less stable packages and thus violates the Stable Dependencies Principle. Only org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model is more stable (I=0.0943). Because the majority of outgoing dependencies are less stable than the package itself, the Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
