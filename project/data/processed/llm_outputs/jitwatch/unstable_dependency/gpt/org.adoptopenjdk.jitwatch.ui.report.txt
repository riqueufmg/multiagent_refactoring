"justification": "The package has Ce=9 and Ca=1 -> instability I = 9/(9+1) = 0.90 (highly unstable). For the Unstable Dependency smell we check whether it depends on packages that are less stable (higher I) than itself. Outgoing dependency instabilities: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core I=0.188, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.suggestion I=0.50, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report I=0.154, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.cell I=0.75, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.locks I=0.667, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.inlining I=0.667, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util I=0.114, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation I=0.667, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main I=0.622. All outgoing dependencies have instability values lower than 0.90 (i.e. they are more stable than org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report). Incoming dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main has I=0.622 (also more stable). Therefore org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report does not depend on less stable packages and the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
