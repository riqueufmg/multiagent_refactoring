"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang has Ce=4 and Ca=3 (stability = 3/(3+4) ≈ 0.429). One of its outgoing dependencies, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime, has Ce=3 and Ca=2 (stability = 2/(2+3) = 0.4), which is less stable than jvmlang. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, jvmlang should only depend on packages more stable than itself; this dependency on process.runtime violates that rule. (Other outgoing deps: core stability ≈ 0.8125, logger = 1.0, process.compiler = 0.75 — these are more stable and do not violate the principle.)"
