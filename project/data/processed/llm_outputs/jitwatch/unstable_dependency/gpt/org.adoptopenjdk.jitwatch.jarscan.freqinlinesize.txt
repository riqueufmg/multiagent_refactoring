"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=3, Ca=1 -> Instability I = 3/(3+1) = 0.75 (relatively unstable). Outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48 -> I = 5/53 ≈ 0.094), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39 -> I = 5/44 ≈ 0.114), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (Ce=3, Ca=22 -> I = 3/25 = 0.12). All outgoing targets are substantially more stable (much lower I) than the analyzed package, so the package does not depend on less stable components. Incoming dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan (Ce=11, Ca=0 -> I = 1.0) is unstable, but this is an incoming dependency and does not constitute an unstable dependency smell for the analyzed package. Therefore detection = false."
