"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.inline",
"detection": false,
"justification": "Analyzed package has Ce=2, Ca=1 (instability I=2/(1+2)=0.667). Its outgoing dependencies are to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I=5/(5+48)=0.094) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation (Ce=3, Ca=9, I=3/(3+9)=0.25). Both target packages are more stable (lower instability) than org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.inline, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected. Incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.launch (Ce=8, Ca=0, I=1.0) does not create an unstable dependency for the analyzed package."
