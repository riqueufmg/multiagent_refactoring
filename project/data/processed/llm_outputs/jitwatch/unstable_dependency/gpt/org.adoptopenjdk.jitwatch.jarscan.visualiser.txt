"detection": false,
"justification": "Analyzed package has Ce=1, Ca=0 (instability I = 1/(0+1) = 1.0) and no incoming dependencies. It has a single outgoing dependency to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util which has Ce=5, Ca=39 (instability I = 5/(39+5) ≈ 0.114). The dependency direction is from a highly unstable package (I=1.0) to a much more stable package (I≈0.114), so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and there are no dependencies on less stable components."
