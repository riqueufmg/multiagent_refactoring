"justification": "The package is highly stable (stability = Ca/(Ca+Ce) = 48/(48+5) = 0.906) yet it has outgoing dependencies to packages that are less stable: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core (stability = 13/(13+3) = 0.813), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader (7/(7+5) = 0.583), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (22/(22+3) = 0.880), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly (7/(7+4) = 0.636), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (39/(39+5) = 0.886). Because the analyzed package depends on components with lower stability, it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle and exhibits the Unstable Dependency smell."
