  "justification": "Analyzed package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.locks has Ce=2, Ca=1 -> Instability I=2/(1+2)=0.667. Its outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report (Ce=2, Ca=11 -> I=2/13=0.154) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48 -> I=5/53=0.094). Both targets are more stable (lower I) than the analyzed package, so dependencies point toward more stable packages and the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected. The incoming dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report (Ce=9, Ca=1 -> I=0.9) is an unstable package depending on this package, which does not constitute an unstable dependency from the analyzed package. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell detected."
