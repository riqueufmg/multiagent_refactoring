  "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui",

  "justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=1, Ca=3 -> instability I_ui = 1/(1+3) = 0.25. Outgoing dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39 -> I_util = 5/(5+39) ≈ 0.1136). The package only depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util which is more stable (lower instability) than org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected. Incoming dependencies (e.g., org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main) show other packages depend on this package but do not create unstable outgoing dependencies from this package. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell detected."
