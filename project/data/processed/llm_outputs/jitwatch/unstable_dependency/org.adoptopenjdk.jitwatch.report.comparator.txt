"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.comparator",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package depends only on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report (outgoing Ce=1). Instability: report.comparator I = 1/(1+2) = 0.333; org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report I = 2/(2+11) = 0.154. The dependency is toward a more stable package (lower instability), satisfying the Stable Dependencies Principle. Incoming dependents (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.launch, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main) do not make its outgoing dependency unstable. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell detected."
