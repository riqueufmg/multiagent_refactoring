"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor has Ce=1 and Ca=5 (instability I=1/(1+5)=0.1667). Its only outgoing dependency is org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model which has Ce=5 and Ca=48 (I=5/(5+48)=0.0943). The dependency direction is toward a more stable package (model has lower instability), so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected. Incoming dependencies (toplist, launch, histo, report, compilation) increase treevisitor's Ca but do not create an unstable dependency from treevisitor to its outgoing package, therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
