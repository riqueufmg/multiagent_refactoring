"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.methodsizehisto",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has Ce=2 and Ca=1 (stability I = 1/(1+2) = 0.333). Its outgoing dependencies are to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (Ca=22, Ce=3, I=22/(22+3)=0.880) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ca=48, Ce=5, I=48/(48+5)=0.906). Both target packages are significantly more stable than the analyzed package, so the package does not depend on less stable components. Although there is an incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan (Ca=0, Ce=11, very unstable), incoming unstable clients do not create the Unstable Dependency smell for this package. Therefore no unstable-dependency smell is detected."
