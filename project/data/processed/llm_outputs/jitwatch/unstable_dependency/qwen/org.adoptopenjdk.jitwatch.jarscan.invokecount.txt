"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.invokecount has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode. The stability metric (I = Ce/(Ce+Ca)) for the analyzed package is 2/(2+1) = 0.67. For org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util, stability is 5/(5+39) = 0.11. For org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode, stability is 3/(3+22) = 0.12. Since the analyzed package (I=0.67) depends on packages with lower stability (0.11 and 0.12), this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle correctly - less stable packages depend on more stable ones. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
