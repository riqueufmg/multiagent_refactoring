"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation' has a stability metric (I) of 0.75, calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 3/(9+3). Its outgoing dependencies are to packages with lower stability: 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model' (I=0.096), 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util' (I=0.114), and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor' (I=0.167). Since this package depends on more stable packages (lower I values), it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
