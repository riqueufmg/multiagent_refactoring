"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.source' depends on 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main' (Ce=28, Ca=17) and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview' (Ce=12, Ca=5), both of which have higher efferent coupling and lower afferent coupling compared to the analyzed package (Ce=3, Ca=1). This indicates that the dependencies are less stable than the dependent package, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
