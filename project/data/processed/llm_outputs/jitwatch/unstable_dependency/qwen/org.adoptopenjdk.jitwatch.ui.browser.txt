"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.browser has outgoing dependency on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util. The stability metric (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)) for org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.browser is 0.5 (1/(1+1)), and for org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util is approximately 0.11 (5/(39+5)). Since the dependency is from a less stable package (0.5) to a more stable package (0.11), it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not represent an Unstable Dependency smell."
