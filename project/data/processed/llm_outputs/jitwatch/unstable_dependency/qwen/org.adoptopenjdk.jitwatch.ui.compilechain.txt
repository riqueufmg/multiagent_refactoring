"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain has a stability metric (Ca=1, Ce=6) and depends on packages that are more stable (higher Ca and/or lower Ce values), such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ca=48, Ce=5) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ca=39, Ce=5). All outgoing dependencies are towards packages with higher stability or comparable stability, which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle."
