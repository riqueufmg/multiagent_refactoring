"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencesearch has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode. The stability metric (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)) for the analyzed package is 0.67 (2/(1+2)). For org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, the stability is 0.1 (5/(48+5)), and for org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode, the stability is 0.12 (3/(22+3)). Since both dependencies have lower instability values (more stable) than the analyzed package, the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected. No unstable dependency smell detected."
