"justification": "The package has an instability value of 0.5 (Ce=1, Ca=1), and it depends on 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode' which has an instability value of 0.12 (Ce=3, Ca=22). Since the analyzed package depends on a more stable package (lower instability value), it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
