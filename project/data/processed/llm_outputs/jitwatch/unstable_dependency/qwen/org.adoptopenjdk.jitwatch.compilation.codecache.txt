"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.codecache has a stability metric (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) of 0.33, making it relatively stable. However, it depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model which has a stability metric of 0.094, making it more stable. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
