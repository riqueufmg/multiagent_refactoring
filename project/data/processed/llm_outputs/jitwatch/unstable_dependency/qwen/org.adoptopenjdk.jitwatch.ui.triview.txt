"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview has outgoing dependencies to packages that are less stable (higher Ce/(Ce+Ca) ratio) or equally stable, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. For example, it depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.source (I=0.75), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser (I=0.5), and others with similar instability metrics. These dependencies indicate that the package depends on components that are not more stable than itself, hence creating an unstable dependency."
