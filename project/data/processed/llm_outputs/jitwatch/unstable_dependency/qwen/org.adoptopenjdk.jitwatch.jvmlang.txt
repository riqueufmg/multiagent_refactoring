Specifically, it depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler (stability = 0.25), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime (stability = 0.6), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core (stability = 0.19). These dependencies create unstable dependency relationships as the target packages have lower or comparable stability compared to the source package."
