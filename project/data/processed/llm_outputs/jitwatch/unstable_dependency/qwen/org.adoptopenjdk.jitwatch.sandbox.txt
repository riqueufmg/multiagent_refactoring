"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox' has a stability metric (Ca/(Ca+Ce)) of 1/(1+10) = 0.09. It depends on packages like 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox' which has a stability of 2/(2+12) = 0.14, and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util' with stability 39/(39+5) = 0.89. While some dependencies are more stable, the dependency on 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox' violates the Stable Dependencies Principle because it depends on a less stable package (stability 0.14 < 0.09 is not the case here, correction: the sandbox package is less stable than ui.sandbox, so this is not a violation. Let's recheck all dependencies. The analyzed package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox' (stability = 1/11 ≈ 0.09) depends on 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox' (stability = 2/14 ≈ 0.14). Since 0.09 (itself) < 0.14 (dependency), and it depends on it, this is a violation of the Stable Dependencies Principle. It depends on a package that is less stable than itself."
