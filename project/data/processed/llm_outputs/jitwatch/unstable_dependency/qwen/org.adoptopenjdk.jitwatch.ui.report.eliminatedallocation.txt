"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (I=0.15, instability=5/34≈0.147) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report (I=0.15, instability=2/13≈0.154). The analyzed package has an instability of 2/3≈0.667. Both outgoing dependencies have lower instability values than the analyzed package, which means the dependencies are more stable. This complies with the Stable Dependencies Principle, hence no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
