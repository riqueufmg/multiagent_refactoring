"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly has outgoing dependencies on packages org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.x86, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we must compare the stability (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) of the analyzed package with the stability of its dependencies. The analyzed package has Ce=4 and Ca=7, so its instability I=4/(7+4)=0.36. The dependencies have the following instabilities: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (I=5/(48+5)=0.09), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.x86 (I=1/(2+1)=0.33), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (I=5/(39+5)=0.11), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm (I=1/(2+1)=0.33). All dependencies have instability values less than or equal to the analyzed package's instability, which means the dependencies are more stable or equally stable. Therefore, there is no unstable dependency."
