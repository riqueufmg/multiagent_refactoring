"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain has a stability value (I) calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 3/(1+3) = 0.75. Its outgoing dependencies are org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (I=5/(48+5)≈0.09), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation (I=3/(9+3)=0.25), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (I=5/(39+5)≈0.11). Since the chain package (I=0.75) depends on packages with lower instability values (0.09, 0.25, 0.11), it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle by depending on more stable packages. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
