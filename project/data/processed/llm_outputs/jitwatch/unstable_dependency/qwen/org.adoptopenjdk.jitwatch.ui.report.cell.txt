"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.cell' has a stability value (I) of 0.75, calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 3/(1+3). Its outgoing dependencies are 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model' (I=0.094), 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main' (I=0.623), and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report' (I=0.154). All these dependencies have lower instability values than the analyzed package, meaning it depends on more stable packages. This complies with the Stable Dependencies Principle, hence no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
