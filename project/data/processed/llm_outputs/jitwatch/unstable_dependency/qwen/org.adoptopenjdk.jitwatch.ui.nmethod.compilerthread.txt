"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we must compare the stability (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) of the analyzed package with its dependencies. The analyzed package has Ce=3 and Ca=1, giving it an instability of 0.75. The dependencies have the following instabilities: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I=0.096), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39, I=0.114), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17, I=0.622). Since all dependencies have lower instability values than the analyzed package, the Stable Dependencies Principle is followed, and thus there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
