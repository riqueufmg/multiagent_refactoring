"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow has outgoing dependencies on four packages: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode. All of these packages have higher Ca (afferent couplings) and similar or higher stability (lower instability index) compared to the hotthrow package, indicating they are more stable. The hotthrow package does not depend on any less stable packages, thus adhering to the Stable Dependencies Principle."
