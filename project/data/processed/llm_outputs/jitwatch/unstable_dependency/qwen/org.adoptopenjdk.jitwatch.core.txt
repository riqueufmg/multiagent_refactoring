"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core' has a stability metric (Ca/(Ca+Ce)) of 13/(13+3) = 0.8125, indicating it is relatively stable. However, it depends on packages like 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model' (stability = 48/(48+5) = 0.9057), 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util' (stability = 39/(39+5) = 0.8864), and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode' (stability = 22/(22+3) = 0.88), all of which are more stable than itself. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Hence, an unstable dependency smell is detected."
