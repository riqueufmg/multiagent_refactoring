"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.visualiser has stability of 0.0 (Ce=1, Ca=0, so Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 1/1 = 1.0 for instability, but since it has no incoming dependencies, it's considered stable). It depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util which has stability of 0.11 (Ce=5, Ca=39, so 5/(5+39) = 0.11), making it more stable. Since the dependency is towards a more stable package, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
