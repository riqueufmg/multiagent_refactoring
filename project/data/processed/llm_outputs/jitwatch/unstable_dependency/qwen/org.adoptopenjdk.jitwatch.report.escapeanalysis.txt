"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has outgoing dependencies to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (stability=0.095), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (stability=0.12), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report (stability=0.154). Since the analyzed package has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0), it is maximally unstable (instability=1.0). The dependencies are to packages that are more stable than itself, following the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
