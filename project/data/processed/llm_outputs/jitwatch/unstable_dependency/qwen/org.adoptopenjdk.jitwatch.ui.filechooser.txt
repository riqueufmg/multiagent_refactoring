"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.filechooser has a stability index (I) of 0.33 (Ce=1, Ca=2), while its outgoing dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util has a stability index of 0.11 (Ce=5, Ca=39). Since the filechooser package (I=0.33) depends on a more stable package util (I=0.11), this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not represent an Unstable Dependency smell."
