"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize' has no outgoing dependencies (Ce=0), meaning it does not depend on any other packages. Therefore, it cannot have an unstable dependency since it depends on nothing. Its stability metric I (instability) would be 0 (fully stable), and it is being depended upon by other packages (Ca=3), which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle as it does not depend on anything less stable."
