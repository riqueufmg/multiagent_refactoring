All of its outgoing dependencies have stability values: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (5/(5+48) = 0.09), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize (0/(0+3) = 0), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (5/(5+39) = 0.11), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo (3/(3+1) = 0.75), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (28/(28+17) = 0.62). Since all outgoing dependencies are more stable (lower stability value) than the analyzed package, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
