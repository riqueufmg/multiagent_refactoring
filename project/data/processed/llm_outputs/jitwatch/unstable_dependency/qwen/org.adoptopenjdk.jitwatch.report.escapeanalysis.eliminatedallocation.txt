"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.escapeanalysis.eliminatedallocation has a stability value (I) of 0.67, calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 2/(1+2). Its outgoing dependencies are to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (I=0.10, calculated as 5/(48+5)) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (I=0.12, calculated as 3/(22+3)). Both dependencies have lower instability values, meaning they are more stable than the analyzed package. This complies with the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
