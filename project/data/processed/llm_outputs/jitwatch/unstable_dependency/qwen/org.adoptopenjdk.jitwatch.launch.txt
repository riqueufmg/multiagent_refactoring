"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.launch' has a stability (I) of 1.0 (Ce=8, Ca=0), meaning it is completely unstable. It depends on packages such as 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser' (I=0.375), 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core' (I=0.1875), and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor' (I=0.1667), which are more stable than itself. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Therefore, an Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
