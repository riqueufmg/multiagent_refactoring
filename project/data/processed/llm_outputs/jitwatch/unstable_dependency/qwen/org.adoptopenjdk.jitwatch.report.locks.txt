The stability metric (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) for org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.locks is 2 / (1 + 2) = 0.67. The stability of org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model is 5 / (48 + 5) = 0.09 and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode is 3 / (22 + 3) = 0.12. Since the analyzed package depends on packages that are more stable (lower instability values) than itself, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle and hence does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
