"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model' has a stability metric (Ca=48, Ce=5) indicating it is highly stable due to many afferent couplings (incoming dependencies) and few efferent couplings (outgoing dependencies). All outgoing dependencies are to packages that are less stable (higher Ce, lower Ca), which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
