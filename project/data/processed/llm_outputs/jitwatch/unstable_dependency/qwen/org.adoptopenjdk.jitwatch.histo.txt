The dependent packages org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor have higher instability values (Ca/(Ca+Ce)) of 0.92, 0.75, and 0.83 respectively, while the current package has an instability value of 0.75. Since the dependencies are towards more stable packages, there is no unstable dependency smell."
