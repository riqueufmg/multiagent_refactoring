"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger' has no outgoing dependencies (Ce=0), meaning it does not depend on any other packages. Therefore, it cannot have an unstable dependency since it depends on nothing. Incoming dependencies exist from multiple packages, but this does not affect its own stability or create an unstable dependency smell."
