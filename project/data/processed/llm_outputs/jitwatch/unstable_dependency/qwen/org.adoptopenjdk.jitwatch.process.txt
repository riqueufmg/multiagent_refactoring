The stability of 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process' is 0.33 (Ce=1, Ca=2, Stability = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 1/3). The stability of 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger' is 0 (Ce=0, Ca=6, Stability = 0/6 = 0). Since the dependency is towards a more stable package (0.33 > 0), it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. No unstable dependency smell is detected."
