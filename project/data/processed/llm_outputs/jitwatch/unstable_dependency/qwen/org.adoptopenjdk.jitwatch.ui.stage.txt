"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage' has an instability value of 0.6 (Ce=3, Ca=2; instability = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 3/5 = 0.6). It depends on 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main', which has an instability value of 0.62 (Ce=28, Ca=17; instability = 28/45 ≈ 0.62). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle because 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage' (instability 0.6) depends on a package that is less stable than itself (instability 0.62)."
