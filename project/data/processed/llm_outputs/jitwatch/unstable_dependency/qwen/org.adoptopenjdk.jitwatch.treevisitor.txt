"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor has an instability value of 0.2 (Ce=1, Ca=5, instability = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 1/6 ≈ 0.167). The package it depends on, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, has an instability value of 0.096 (Ce=5, Ca=48, instability = 5/53 ≈ 0.094). Since the treevisitor package (with higher instability) depends on the model package (with lower instability), this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
