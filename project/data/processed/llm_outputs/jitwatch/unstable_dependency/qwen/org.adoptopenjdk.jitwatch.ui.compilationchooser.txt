"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (stability=0.172) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (stability=0.622). The stability of this package is 0.5 (Ce=2, Ca=2). It only depends on packages that are more stable or equally stable (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model is less stable, but org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main is more stable). However, since the package depends on a less stable package (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model), it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle and should be detected as an unstable dependency. Correction: The package depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (stability=5/(5+48)=0.095) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (stability=28/(28+17)=0.622). The stability of the analyzed package is 2/(2+2)=0.5. Since it depends on a package (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model) with lower stability (0.095 < 0.5), this is an unstable dependency."
