"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader' has outgoing dependencies on packages that are less stable than itself. Stability is determined by the ratio of Ca/(Ca+Ce), where Ca is afferent couplings (incoming dependencies) and Ce is efferent couplings (outgoing dependencies). The stability of 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader' is 7/(7+5) = 0.58. Its dependency 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang' has stability 3/(3+4) = 0.43, and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.javap' has stability 1/(1+1) = 0.5. Both of these dependencies have lower stability than the loader package, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
