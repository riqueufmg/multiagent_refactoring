"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount has a stability of 0.33 (Ce=1, Ca=2) and depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode which has a stability of 0.12 (Ce=3, Ca=22). Since the dependent package is more stable (lower stability value), this does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. The package depends on a more stable component, which is the correct direction according to the principle."
