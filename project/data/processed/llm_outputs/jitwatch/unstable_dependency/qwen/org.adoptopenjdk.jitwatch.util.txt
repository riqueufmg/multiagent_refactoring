"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util' has outgoing dependencies on packages that are more stable (higher Ca, lower Ce), such as 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model' (Ca=48, Ce=5), 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core' (Ca=13, Ce=3), and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode' (Ca=22, Ce=3). These dependencies align with the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Additionally, 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util' has a high number of incoming dependencies (Ca=39), indicating it is a stable package upon which many others depend. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell detected for this package."
