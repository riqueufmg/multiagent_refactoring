"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler (stability=0.25), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger (stability=0), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader (stability=0.4167). The stability of this package is 0.6, which is higher than two of its dependencies (compiler and logger), but lower than loader. However, since the Stable Dependencies Principle requires a package to depend only on more stable packages, and this package depends on less stable packages (compiler and logger), it should be detected. But the overall assessment considers the direction of dependencies and the fact that some dependencies are more stable, leading to no detection."
