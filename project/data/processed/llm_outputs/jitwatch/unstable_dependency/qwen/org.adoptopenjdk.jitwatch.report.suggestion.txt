Among its outgoing dependencies, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model has I = 5/(48+5) = 0.094, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation has I = 3/(9+3) = 0.25, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util has I = 5/(39+5) = 0.114, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report has I = 2/(11+2) = 0.154. All outgoing dependencies have lower instability values than the source package, which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
