"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.codecache has outgoing dependencies on packages that are less stable than itself. Specifically, it depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (I = 0.62, less stable) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.codecache (I = 0.33, less stable). According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should only depend on packages that are more stable (higher I metric, closer to 0). Since this package depends on less stable packages, it exhibits the Unstable Dependency smell."
