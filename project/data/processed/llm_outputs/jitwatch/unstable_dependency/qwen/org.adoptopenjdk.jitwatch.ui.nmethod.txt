"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod' has outgoing dependencies on packages that are less stable (higher instability index) than itself. Specifically, it depends on 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main' (I=0.62), which has a higher instability index than the analyzed package (I=0.57). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable (lower instability index) than itself."
