"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stats",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stats has outgoing dependencies to packages that are less stable (higher Ce/Ca ratio or more unstable characteristics). Specifically, it depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17). The dependent packages have higher efferent couplings and lower afferent couplings compared to the analyzed package, indicating they are less stable. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
