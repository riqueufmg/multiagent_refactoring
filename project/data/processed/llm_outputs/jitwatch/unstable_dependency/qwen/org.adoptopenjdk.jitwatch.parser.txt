"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser' has outgoing dependencies on 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util', and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core'. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we must compare the stability (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) of the analyzed package with that of its dependencies. The analyzed package has Ce=3 and Ca=5, so its instability I=3/(3+5)=0.375. The dependencies have the following instabilities: 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model' has Ce=5 and Ca=48, so I=5/(5+48)=0.094; 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util' has Ce=5 and Ca=39, so I=5/(5+39)=0.114; 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core' has Ce=3 and Ca=13, so I=3/(3+13)=0.188. Since all dependencies have lower instability values than the analyzed package (0.375), it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
