"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main' has outgoing dependencies on multiple packages, some of which are less stable (higher Ce/Ca ratio) than itself. For example, it depends on 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.viewer' (Ce=4, Ca=1), 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.codecache' (Ce=4, Ca=1), and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview' (Ce=12, Ca=5), all of which have higher efferent coupling (Ce) and lower afferent coupling (Ca) compared to the main package. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, as the main package depends on less stable components."
