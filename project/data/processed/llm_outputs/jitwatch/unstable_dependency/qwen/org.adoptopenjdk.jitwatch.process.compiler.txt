"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has a stability of 0.25 (Ce=1, Ca=3, stability = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 1/4 = 0.25). Its outgoing dependency is org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger which has a stability of 0 (Ce=0, Ca=6, stability = 0/6 = 0). Since the package depends on a component that is more stable than itself (0.25 > 0), it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not exhibit Unstable Dependency smell."
