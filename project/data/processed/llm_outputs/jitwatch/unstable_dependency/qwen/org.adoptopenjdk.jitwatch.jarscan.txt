"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan' has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0), meaning it is not depended upon by any other package. Since there are no dependencies pointing to this package, there is no risk of creating an unstable dependency issue. Additionally, all outgoing dependencies point to packages that are more stable (have higher Ca values or lower Ce/Ca ratios), adhering to the Stable Dependencies Principle."
