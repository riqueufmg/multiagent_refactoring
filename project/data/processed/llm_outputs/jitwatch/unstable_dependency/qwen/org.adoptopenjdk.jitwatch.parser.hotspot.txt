"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.hotspot",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.hotspot has outgoing dependencies on four packages: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly. To determine if there is an unstable dependency, we must compare the stability (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) of the analyzed package with the stability of its dependencies. The analyzed package has Ce=4 and Ca=0, so its instability I=1.0 (maximally unstable). The dependencies have the following instabilities: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48, I=0.094), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ce=5, Ca=39, I=0.114), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core (Ce=3, Ca=13, I=0.188), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly (Ce=4, Ca=7, I=0.364). Since the analyzed package (I=1.0) depends only on packages that are more stable than itself (all I < 1.0), it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
