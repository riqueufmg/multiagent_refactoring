"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.bytecode has a stability value (I) calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 6/(1+6) = 0.86. It depends on packages including org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (I=0.09), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (I=0.11), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (I=0.12), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (I=0.62), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report (I=0.15), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview (I=0.71). While most dependencies are to more stable packages, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (I=0.62) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview (I=0.71) are less stable than the analyzed package (I=0.86), violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
