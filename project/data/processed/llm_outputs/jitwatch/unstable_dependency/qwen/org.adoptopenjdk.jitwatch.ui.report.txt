Specifically, it depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.locks (Ce=2, Ca=1), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.inlining (Ce=2, Ca=1), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation (Ce=2, Ca=1), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.suggestion (Ce=1, Ca=1), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.cell (Ce=3, Ca=1). These dependencies violate the Stable Dependencies Principle as these packages have lower stability (higher instability index) compared to the analyzed package."
