"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.j9 has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0) and depends on three other packages: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ca=48), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (Ca=39), and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core (Ca=13). All of these dependencies have higher afferent coupling (Ca) values than the analyzed package, indicating they are more stable. Since the analyzed package depends only on more stable packages, it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
