"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=3, Ca=1 -> Instability I = 3/(3+1) = 0.75. Outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report (Ce=2, Ca=11 -> I=2/13 ≈ 0.154), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Ce=5, Ca=48 -> I=5/53 ≈ 0.094), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main (Ce=28, Ca=17 -> I=28/45 ≈ 0.622). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability values (more stable) than the analyzed package (0.154, 0.094, 0.622 < 0.75), so the package does not depend on less stable components. Incoming dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report has Ce=9, Ca=1 -> I=0.9 (more unstable) but that is an incoming relation and does not indicate this package depends on less stable packages. Therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
