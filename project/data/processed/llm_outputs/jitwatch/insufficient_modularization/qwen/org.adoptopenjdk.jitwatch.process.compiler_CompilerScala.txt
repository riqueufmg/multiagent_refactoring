    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of fields (3), methods (4), and lines of code (48), with a reasonable weighted method count (10). The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization. The class appears to be a small, focused component with appropriate complexity for its size."
