    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AbstractAssemblyParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with WMC of 32 and LOC of 138. It has only 4 methods (NOM) with no public methods (NOPM is 4, same as NOM, indicating all methods are public). The LCOM value of 0.5 suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 3 fields (NOF) and no package dependencies (NOPF is 0), the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization. The DIT of 1 shows it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy, and fanin/fanout of 0 indicate limited external coupling."
