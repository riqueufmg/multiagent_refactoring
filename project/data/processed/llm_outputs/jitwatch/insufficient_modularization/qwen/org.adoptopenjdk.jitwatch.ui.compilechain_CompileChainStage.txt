{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain.CompileChainStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) and 16 fields (nof=16) with a WMC of 26, indicating high complexity. The LOC is 224 which is relatively high for a single class. The class directly depends on 12 external classes, suggesting it has multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
