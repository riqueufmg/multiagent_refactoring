    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.filechooser.FileChooserListSrcZip",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 4 weighted method complexity (wmc=4), and 23 lines of code (loc=23). It has a single field (nof=1) and no class-level dependencies (nc=0, dit=1). The low method count, low complexity metrics, and minimal size indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
