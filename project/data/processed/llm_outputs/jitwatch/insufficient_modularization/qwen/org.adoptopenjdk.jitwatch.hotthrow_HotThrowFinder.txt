    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (3), low WMC (20), and zero lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0), indicating good internal cohesion. With only 118 lines of code and no complex dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
