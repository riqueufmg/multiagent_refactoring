    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3), 13 lines of code (loc=13), and 2 nested classes (nc=2). The LCOM value of 0.667 indicates moderate cohesion. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 3 public methods (nopm=3), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
