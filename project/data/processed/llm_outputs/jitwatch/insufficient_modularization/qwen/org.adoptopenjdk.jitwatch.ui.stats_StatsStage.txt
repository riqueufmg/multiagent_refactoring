    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stats.StatsStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 3 fields (nof=3), with a very low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=3). The class is small in terms of lines of code (loc=42) and has no complex dependencies or high coupling metrics that would indicate insufficient modularization. The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity, suggests the class is already sufficiently decomposed."
