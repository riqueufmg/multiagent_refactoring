    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.LocaleCell",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates minimal complexity and size. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting simple implementation complexity. With such minimal functionality and low complexity metrics, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it appears to be appropriately decomposed for its current responsibilities."
