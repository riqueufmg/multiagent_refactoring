    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.ParsedClasspath",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 1 field (nof=1) with very low complexity (wmc=3, lcom=0.0). The low number of methods and fields indicates proper modularization. The class is small in size (loc=14) and has no dependencies, suggesting it is well-decomposed and focused on a single responsibility."
