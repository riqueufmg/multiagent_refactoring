    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 10 lines of code (loc=10) and zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With such low size and complexity, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
