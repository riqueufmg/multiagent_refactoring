    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.EventType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 methods (1 public), 1 field, 8 lines of code, and WMC of 2. The low number of methods, fields, and lines of code indicates the class is already well decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
