    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo.InlineSizeHistoVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 5 methods (nom=5) with 4 private methods (nopm=4), indicating proper encapsulation. The lines of code (loc=94) and weighted method count (wmc=17) are within reasonable limits for a focused class. The low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and good cohesion (lcom=0.4) suggest the class is well-modularized. The depth of inheritance (dit=3) is moderate and does not indicate excessive complexity."
