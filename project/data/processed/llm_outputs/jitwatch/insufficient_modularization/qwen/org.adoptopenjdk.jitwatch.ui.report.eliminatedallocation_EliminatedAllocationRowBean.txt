    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6, nopm=6) and 32 lines of code (loc=32), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=8) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
