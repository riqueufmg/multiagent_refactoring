    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.NetUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 39 lines of code (loc=39), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and high LCOM value (0.667), the class appears to have cohesive responsibilities. The low number of methods and fields suggests the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
