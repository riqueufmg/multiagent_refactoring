    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (74), methods (79), and lines of code (983), along with a high Weighted Method Count (174). These metrics indicate a large and complex class that likely encompasses multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to improve modularity."
