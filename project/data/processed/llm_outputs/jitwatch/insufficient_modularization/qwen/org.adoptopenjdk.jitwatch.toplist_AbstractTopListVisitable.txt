    "justification": "The class has moderate size (33 LOC, 6 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=8). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates good cohesion, and the DIT of 2 shows appropriate inheritance depth. The number of fields (4) and methods (6) are within acceptable ranges for a single class responsibility. No clear indication of functionality that should be further decomposed."
