    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with low complexity (wmc=2), contains 33 lines of code (loc=33), and has minimal dependencies with only 1 fanout dependency. The low number of methods, low cyclomatic complexity, and small size indicate sufficient modularization without need for further decomposition."
