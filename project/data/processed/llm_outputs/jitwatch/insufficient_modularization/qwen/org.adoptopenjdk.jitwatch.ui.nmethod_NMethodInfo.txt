    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.NMethodInfo",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 154 lines of code (loc), 12 methods (nom), and 15 fields (nof), indicating a relatively large and complex class. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low cohesion metrics suggest this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The high number of dependencies (4 external classes) also indicates potential for better modularization."
