    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.ILogParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 12 methods (nom), 16 lines of code (loc), and a low weighted method count (wmc) of 12. The lack of fields (nof=0) and low number of methods suggest it is already well modularized as an interface. The dependencies are appropriate for an interface defining parsing behavior."
