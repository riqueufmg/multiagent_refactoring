    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm.ARMDirective",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 17 lines of code (loc=17), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be appropriately modularized for its simple purpose as an ARM directive representation."
