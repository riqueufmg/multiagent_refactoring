    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 9 lines of code (loc=9), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no complex dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
