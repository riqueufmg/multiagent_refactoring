    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITEvent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5), 3 fields (nof=3), and 26 lines of code (loc=26). The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low method count indicate proper modularization. No complex dependencies or high coupling metrics suggest insufficient modularization issues."
