    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread.CompilerThreadStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 28 methods (nom), 77 weighted method count (wmc), 467 lines of code (loc), and 17 fields (nof). The high number of methods and lines of code suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
