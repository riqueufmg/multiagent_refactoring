    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.hotspot.HotSpotLogParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 19 methods (nom), WMC of 70 indicating high method complexity, and 253 lines of code (loc). The low LCOM value (0.1578947368421052) suggests some cohesion but the high method count and complexity suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
