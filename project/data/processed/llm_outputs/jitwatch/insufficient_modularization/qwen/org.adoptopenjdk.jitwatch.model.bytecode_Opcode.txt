    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (42 lines of code, 10 methods) and complexity (WMC=10). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates moderate cohesion which is acceptable. With only 4 fields and no dependencies, this appears to be a well-contained, focused class that represents a single responsibility (opcode modeling). The metrics do not indicate excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
