    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 29 methods (nom=29) but also has very low complexity metrics with only 31 lines of code (loc=31) and weighted method count of 29 (wmc=29), suggesting each method is very simple. The lack of fields (nof=0) and low lines of code indicate this is likely an interface or very simple class that is appropriately modularized. The single nested class (nc=1) does not indicate insufficient modularization given the overall simplicity of the class."
