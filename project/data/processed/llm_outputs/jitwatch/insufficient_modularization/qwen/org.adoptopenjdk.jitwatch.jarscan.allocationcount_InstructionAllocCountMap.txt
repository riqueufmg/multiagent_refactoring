    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with low complexity (wmc=4), contains minimal fields (nof=1), and has very low lines of code (loc=20). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
