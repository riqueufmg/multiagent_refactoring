    "class": "(default package).InlineElimAlloc",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 31 lines of code (loc=31), with a low weighted method count (wmc=6). These metrics indicate a relatively small and simple class that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization, which typically involves classes that are overly large or complex and would benefit from further decomposition."
