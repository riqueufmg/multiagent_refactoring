{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriViewPane",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods (nom), 12 weighted method count (wmc), and 55 lines of code (loc). The lack of fields (nof=5, nc=0) and low LCOM value (0.0) suggests good cohesion. The modularization appears sufficient given the class size and complexity metrics."
