    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 30 weighted method count (wmc=30), indicating high implementation complexity. The lack of private fields (nopf=0) and low cohesion among methods (lcom=0.1428571428571428) suggest that the class may not be well modularized. With 112 lines of code (loc=112) and 8 fields (nof=8), the class presents a medium size but high complexity, which indicates that further decomposition could reduce its size and implementation complexity."
