    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 4 lines of code (loc=4), which indicates minimal size and complexity. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is also low (wmc=2), suggesting simple implementation complexity. With such minimal metrics, further decomposition would not provide meaningful reduction in size or complexity."
