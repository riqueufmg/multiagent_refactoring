{
    "class": "(default package).CodeCacheBuster",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has excessive size and complexity indicators: 5001 methods (nom), 5001 public methods (nopm), 20010 lines of code (loc), and a high weighted method count (wmc) of 5002. These metrics significantly exceed typical thresholds for well-modularized classes, indicating insufficient decomposition where the class should be broken down into smaller, more manageable components."
