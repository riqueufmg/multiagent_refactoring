{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MemberSignatureParts",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 29 methods (nom), 109 weighted methods count (wmc), and 462 lines of code (loc). The high number of methods and weighted method complexity suggests the class may contain too much functionality and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has 11 fields (nof) which adds to its complexity. Despite having 21 private methods (nopm), the overall size and complexity exceed typical modularization guidelines."
