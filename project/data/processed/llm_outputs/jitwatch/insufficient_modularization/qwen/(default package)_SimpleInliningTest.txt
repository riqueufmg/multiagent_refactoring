    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 15 lines of code (loc=15), with a low weighted method count (wmc=4). These metrics indicate a small, simple class that does not require further decomposition. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its size and complexity."
