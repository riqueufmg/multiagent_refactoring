    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerKotlin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 5 lines of code (loc=29), and a low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lack of fields (nof=3, nc=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=2) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a small, focused component with minimal responsibilities."
