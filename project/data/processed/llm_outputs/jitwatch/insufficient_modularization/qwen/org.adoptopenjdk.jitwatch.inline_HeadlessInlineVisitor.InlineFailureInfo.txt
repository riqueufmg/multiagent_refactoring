    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.inline.HeadlessInlineVisitor.InlineFailureInfo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with a very low LOC count of 32. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies. This suggests a simple data holder class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate it is already well-decomposed for its intended purpose."
