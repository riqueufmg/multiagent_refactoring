    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 35 lines of code (loc=35), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and good cohesion (lcom=1.0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already reasonably small and well-structured."
