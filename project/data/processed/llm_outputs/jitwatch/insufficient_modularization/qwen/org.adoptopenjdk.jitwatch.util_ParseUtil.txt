{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.ParseUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 46 methods (nom=46) and 753 lines of code (loc=753), with a weighted method count of 200 (wmc=200). These metrics indicate high complexity and size, suggesting the class has not been sufficiently decomposed. The high number of methods and lines of code imply that the class likely encompasses multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
