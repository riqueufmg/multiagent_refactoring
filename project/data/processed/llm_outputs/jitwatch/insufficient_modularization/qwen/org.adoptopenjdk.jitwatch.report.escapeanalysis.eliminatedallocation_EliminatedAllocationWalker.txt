    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with low complexity (wmc=2), very few lines of code (loc=8), no fields (nof=0), and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of methods, low complexity, and minimal size indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
