    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.ExceptionTable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 33 lines of code (loc=33), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=9) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class is well-encapsulated. The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, nc=0) indicate this class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
