    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly.ViewerAssembly",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (15) and a high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) value of 57, indicating high complexity. The Lines of Code (LOC) count is 249, which is relatively high for a single class. The class also has a low LCOM value of 0.133, suggesting that while the methods are cohesive, the class might be doing too much and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
