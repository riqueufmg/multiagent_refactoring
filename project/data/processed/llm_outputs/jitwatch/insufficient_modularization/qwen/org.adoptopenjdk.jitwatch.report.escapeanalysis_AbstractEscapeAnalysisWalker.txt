    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.escapeanalysis.AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 3 public), low complexity (WMC=14), and reasonable size (65 LOC). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates good cohesion, and the depth of inheritance (DIT=3) is moderate. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately decomposed with manageable complexity and size."
