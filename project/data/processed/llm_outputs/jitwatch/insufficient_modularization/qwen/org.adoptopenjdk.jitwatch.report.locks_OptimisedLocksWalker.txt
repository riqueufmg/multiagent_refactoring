    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with low complexity (wmc=2), very few lines of code (loc=8), no fields (nof=0), and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of methods and minimal complexity indicate sufficient modularization for this class's current functionality."
