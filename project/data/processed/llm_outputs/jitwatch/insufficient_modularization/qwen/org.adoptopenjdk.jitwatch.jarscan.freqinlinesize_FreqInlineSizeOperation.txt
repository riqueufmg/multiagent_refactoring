{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.freqinlinesize.FreqInlineSizeOperation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 4 public), low complexity (WMC=9), and reasonable size (57 LOC). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates good cohesion, and the lack of inheritance (DIT=1) and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests a well-contained, focused class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
