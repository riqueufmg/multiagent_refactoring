    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.invokecount.MethodCountMap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 36 lines of code (loc=36), with a low weighted method count (wmc=6). The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low complexity metrics indicate this is a small, focused class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its size and complexity."
