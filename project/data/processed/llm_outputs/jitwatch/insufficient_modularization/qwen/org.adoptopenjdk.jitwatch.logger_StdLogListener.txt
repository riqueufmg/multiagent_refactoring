    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.StdLogListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 8 lines of code (loc=8), with no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The low complexity metrics (wmc=2, dit=1, nc=0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused component with minimal complexity that does not require further decomposition."
