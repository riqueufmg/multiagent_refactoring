    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 13 lines of code (loc=13), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 2 public methods (nopm=2) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), this class appears to be well-decomposed and focused on a single responsibility. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's not heavily coupled, and the depth of inheritance tree (dit=3) is reasonable. The negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) may indicate good cohesion among the methods."
