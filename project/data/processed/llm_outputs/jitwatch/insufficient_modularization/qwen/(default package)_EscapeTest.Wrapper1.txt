    "class": "(default package).EscapeTest.Wrapper1",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 12 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and WMC of 0. The low size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or complex implementation that would benefit from further decomposition."
