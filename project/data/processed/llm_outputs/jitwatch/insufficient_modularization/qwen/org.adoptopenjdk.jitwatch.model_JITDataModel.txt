    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITDataModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=22, nopm=22), high lines of code (loc=228), and a high weighted method count (wmc=50), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The class also has a low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.2272727272727272), which may indicate that the class is doing too many things and could be further decomposed into smaller, more cohesive units."
