    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 methods (nom=8) and 10 lines of code (loc=10), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=8) is low, suggesting minimal implementation complexity. With only 1 nested class (nc=1) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
