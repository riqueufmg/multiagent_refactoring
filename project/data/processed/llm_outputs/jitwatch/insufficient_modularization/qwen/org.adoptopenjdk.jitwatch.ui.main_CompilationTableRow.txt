    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.CompilationTableRow",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 10 methods (nom) and 20 weighted method count (wmc), which is within acceptable limits for a single class. The lack of fields (nof=1) and low lines of code (loc=71) suggest it's focused on a specific responsibility. The LCOM value of 0.2 indicates good cohesion, and the absence of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest proper modularization. While it has dependencies on 4 external classes, this is reasonable for a UI component that needs to interact with model and utility classes."
