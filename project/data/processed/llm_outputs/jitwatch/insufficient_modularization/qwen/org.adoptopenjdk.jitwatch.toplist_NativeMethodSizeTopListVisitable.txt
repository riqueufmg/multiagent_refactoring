    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 27 lines of code (loc=27), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 public methods (nopm=2) and no fields (nof=0), the class appears to be well-focused and adequately modularized for its size and complexity."
