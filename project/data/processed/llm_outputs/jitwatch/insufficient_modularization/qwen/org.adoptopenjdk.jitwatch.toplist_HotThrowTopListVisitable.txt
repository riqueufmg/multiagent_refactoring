{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.HotThrowTopListVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), low WMC (7), no class dependencies (nc=0), and reasonable size (26 LOC). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the DIT of 3 suggests appropriate inheritance depth. The low number of methods and metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
