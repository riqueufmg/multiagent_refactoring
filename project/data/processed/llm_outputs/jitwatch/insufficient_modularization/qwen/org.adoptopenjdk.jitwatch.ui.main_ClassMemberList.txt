    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.ClassMemberList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 27 methods (nom=27) with 15 public methods (nopm=15), high Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=45), and 222 lines of code (loc=222). It also has 6 fields (nof=6) and depends on 7 external classes, indicating high complexity and potential violation of single responsibility principle. The combination of high method count, high cyclomatic complexity, and multiple dependencies suggests insufficient modularization where the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused components."
