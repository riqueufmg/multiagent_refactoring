    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 methods (nom=9, wmc=9) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates a small and simple class. The lack of fields (nof=0) and low complexity metrics suggest it is already well modularized. No further decomposition would provide significant benefits in terms of size or complexity reduction."
