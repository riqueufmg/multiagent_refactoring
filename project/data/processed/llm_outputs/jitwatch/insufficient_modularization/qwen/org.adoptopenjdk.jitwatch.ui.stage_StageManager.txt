    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage.StageManager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 15 methods (nom) and WMC of 31, which is manageable. The LCOM value of 0.133 indicates good cohesion within the class. With only 137 lines of code (loc) and 3 fields, the class size is reasonable. The method count and complexity metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
