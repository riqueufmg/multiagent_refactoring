    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 5 lines of code (loc=5), which indicates a very small and simple class. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no fields (nof=0), this interface is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
