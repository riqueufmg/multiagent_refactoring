    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.viewer.JournalViewerStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=33), and low weighted method count (wmc=6). The class also has a simple dependency structure with only 3 dependencies and no inheritance (dit=1). These metrics indicate proper modularization rather than insufficient decomposition."
