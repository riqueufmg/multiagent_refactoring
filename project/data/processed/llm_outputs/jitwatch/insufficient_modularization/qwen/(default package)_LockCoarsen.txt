    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 19 lines of code (loc=19), with a low weighted method count (wmc=3). These metrics indicate a small, simple class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed given its minimal complexity and size."
