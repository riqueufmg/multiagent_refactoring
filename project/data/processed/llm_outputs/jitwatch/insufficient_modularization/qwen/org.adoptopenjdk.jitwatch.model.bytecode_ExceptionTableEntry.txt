    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.ExceptionTableEntry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 32 lines of code (loc=32), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. With 4 fields (nof=4) and no package dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to have a single responsibility and limited complexity. The low WMC value (6) suggests minimal method complexity, and the zero LCOM value indicates good cohesion among methods. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class is appropriately sized and does not show signs of needing further decomposition."
