{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.InnerClassRelationship",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 3 fields (nof=3) with 26 lines of code (loc=26). The weighted method count (wmc=6) and lack of cohesion metric (lcom=0.4) indicate moderate complexity and reasonable cohesion. The class has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance (dit=0), suggesting it is a simple, self-contained data structure. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
