{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.HeadlessUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) with 1 public method (nopm=1), and a relatively low weighted method count (wmc=15). The lines of code (loc=77) indicate a small class size. While the class has dependencies on 4 other classes, the low method count and manageable complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its current functionality."
