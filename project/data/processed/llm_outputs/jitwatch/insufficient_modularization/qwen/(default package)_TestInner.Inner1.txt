    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 19 lines of code (loc=19). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating no computational complexity. With no methods or fields, there is no meaningful functionality to decompose further, and the class is already at minimal size and complexity."
