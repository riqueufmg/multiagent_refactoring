    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.LineTable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 37 and 17 methods, suggesting it may be doing too much. The LCOM value of 0.176 indicates some cohesion issues. With only 3 fields but 17 methods, the class appears to have a high method-to-field ratio, potentially indicating insufficient decomposition of responsibilities. The class has 151 lines of code which, combined with the method count, suggests it could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
