{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.InliningFailReasonTopListVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a reasonable size (77 LOC), moderate complexity (WMC=14), good method distribution (5 methods with 4 private methods), and acceptable cohesion (LCOM=0.4). The inheritance depth (DIT=3) is moderate and the class has low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate sufficient modularization for a class of this size and complexity."
