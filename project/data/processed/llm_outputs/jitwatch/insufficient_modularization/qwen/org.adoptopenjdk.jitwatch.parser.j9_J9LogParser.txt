    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.j9.J9LogParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with WMC of 16 and LCOM of 0.75, but with only 4 methods and 70 lines of code, it does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be reasonably decomposed for its functionality."
