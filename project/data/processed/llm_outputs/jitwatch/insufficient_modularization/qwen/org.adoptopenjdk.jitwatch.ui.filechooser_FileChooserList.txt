    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods (6 public) and WMC of 21, which is within acceptable ranges. The LOC is 123 which is reasonable for a UI component. LCOM is 0.0 indicating good cohesion, and there is only 1 dependency. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
