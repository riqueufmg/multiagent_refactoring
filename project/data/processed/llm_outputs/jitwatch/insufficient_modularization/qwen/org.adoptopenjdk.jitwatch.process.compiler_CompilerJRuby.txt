    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerJRuby",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 28 lines of code (loc=28), and low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lack of fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and low coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0, nc=0) indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
