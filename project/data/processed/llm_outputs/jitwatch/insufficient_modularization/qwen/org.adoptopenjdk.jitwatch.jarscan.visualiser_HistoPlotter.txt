    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.visualiser.HistoPlotter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 12 methods and WMC of 24, but no clear indication of insufficient modularization. LCOM value of 0.333 suggests reasonable cohesion, and with only 154 lines of code, the class does not exhibit excessive size that would necessitate further decomposition."
