    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Task",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods (nom), 13 weighted method count (wmc), and 65 lines of code (loc). The lack of class dependencies (nc=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it's already well-decomposed. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and with only 2 fields (nof) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its size and complexity."
