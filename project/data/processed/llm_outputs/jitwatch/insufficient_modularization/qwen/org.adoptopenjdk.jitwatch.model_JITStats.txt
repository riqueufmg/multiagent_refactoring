    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITStats",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 43 methods (nom=43, wmc=43) and 168 lines of code (loc=168), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The lack of fields (nof=19, nopf=0) and absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest this class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to improve modularity and maintainability."
