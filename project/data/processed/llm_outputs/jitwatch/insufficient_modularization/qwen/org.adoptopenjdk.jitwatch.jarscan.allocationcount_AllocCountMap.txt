    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 6 lines of code (loc=37), and low weighted method count (wmc=6). The LCOM value of 0.667 indicates reasonable cohesion. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 3 public methods (nopm=3), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
