    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing.CodeCacheStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a manageable size with 106 lines of code and 5 methods. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) of 18 indicates moderate complexity. With only 1 field and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class does not exhibit excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition. The LCOM value of 0.4 suggests reasonable cohesion within the class."
