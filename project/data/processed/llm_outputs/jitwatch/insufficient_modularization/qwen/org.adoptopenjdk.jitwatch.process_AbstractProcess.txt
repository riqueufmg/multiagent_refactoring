    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.AbstractProcess",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (95 LOC, 9 methods) and complexity (WMC=19) for its functionality as an abstract process handler. The metrics indicate proper modularization with low LCOM (0.333) suggesting good cohesion, and the class serves as an appropriate abstraction layer with manageable complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
