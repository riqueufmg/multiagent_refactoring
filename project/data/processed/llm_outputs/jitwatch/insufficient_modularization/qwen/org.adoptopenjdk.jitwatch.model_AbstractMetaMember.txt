    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.AbstractMetaMember",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 38 methods (nom=38) with 311 lines of code (loc=311) and a weighted method count of 80 (wmc=80), indicating high complexity and size. It also has 11 fields (nof=11) and depends on 9 other classes, suggesting it has too many responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
