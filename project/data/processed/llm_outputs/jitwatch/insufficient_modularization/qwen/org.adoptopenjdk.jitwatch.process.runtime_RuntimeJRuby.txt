{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeJRuby",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 7 weighted method count (wmc=7), and 32 lines of code (loc=32). The lack of fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and low LCOM value (lcom=0.5) suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
