    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 20 lines of code (loc=20) and weighted method count of 5 (wmc=5), which indicates a relatively small and simple class that does not require further decomposition. The low complexity metrics suggest sufficient modularization has already been achieved."
