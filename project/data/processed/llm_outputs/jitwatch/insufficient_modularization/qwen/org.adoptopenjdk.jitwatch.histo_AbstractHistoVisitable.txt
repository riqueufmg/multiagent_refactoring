    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo.AbstractHistoVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4) and 18 lines of code (loc=18). The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests limited responsibility scope. While it has 3 fields (nof=3) and high LCOM value (lcom=0.75) indicating potential cohesion issues, the overall size and complexity are minimal, making further decomposition unnecessary and potentially harmful to maintainability."
