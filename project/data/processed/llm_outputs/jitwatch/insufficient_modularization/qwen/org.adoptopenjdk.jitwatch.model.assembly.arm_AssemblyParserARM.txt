    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm.AssemblyParserARM",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods (nom), 56 weighted methods (wmc), and 214 lines of code (loc). The lack of cohesion metric (lcom = 0.444) suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 6 fields and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The size and complexity are within acceptable ranges for a single class."
