    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 5 lines of code (loc=5). It implements a single comparison function and has minimal complexity. The class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it serves a single, focused purpose."
