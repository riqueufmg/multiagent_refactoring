    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.bytecode.BytecodeLabel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 1 field (nof=1), with low complexity (wmc=2, loc=10). The lack of code (only 10 lines of code) and minimal method count indicate that further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
