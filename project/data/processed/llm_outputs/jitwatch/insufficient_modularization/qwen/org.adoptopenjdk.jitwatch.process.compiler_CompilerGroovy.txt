    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerGroovy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 2 fields (nof=2), with low complexity (wmc=5) and small size (loc=28). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the DIT of 2 suggests appropriate inheritance depth. These metrics indicate proper modularization without excessive complexity or size that would require further decomposition."
