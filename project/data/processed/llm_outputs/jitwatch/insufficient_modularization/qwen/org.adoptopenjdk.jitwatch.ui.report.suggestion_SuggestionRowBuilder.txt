    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.suggestion.SuggestionRowBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 5 public methods (nopm=5), with 49 lines of code (loc=49). The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, indicating low complexity. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests a simple, focused class that is already well-modularized. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
