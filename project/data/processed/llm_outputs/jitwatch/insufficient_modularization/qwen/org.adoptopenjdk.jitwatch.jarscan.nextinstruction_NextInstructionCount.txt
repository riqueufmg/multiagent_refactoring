    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction.NextInstructionCount",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 14 lines of code (loc=14), which indicates a very small and simple class. The lack of fields (nof=2, all private) and low complexity (wmc=3) suggest it is already well modularized. There are no signs of insufficient modularization as the class appears to have appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
