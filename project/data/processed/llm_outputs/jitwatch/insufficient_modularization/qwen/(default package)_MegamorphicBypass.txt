    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 48 lines of code (loc=48), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=7) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=1.0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
