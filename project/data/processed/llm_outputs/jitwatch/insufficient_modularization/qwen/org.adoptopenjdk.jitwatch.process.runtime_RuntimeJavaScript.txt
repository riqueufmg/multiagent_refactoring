    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeJavaScript",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 4 public), low lines of code (32), low weighted method count (7), and reasonable LCOM value (0.75). While it has some room for decomposition, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and structured for its current responsibilities."
