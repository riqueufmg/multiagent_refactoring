{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.TagProcessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 41 and LOC of 170, indicating it may be doing too much. It has 6 methods with only 3 being public, suggesting potential internal complexity that could be decomposed. The class has 5 fields and manages dependencies to 5 external classes, indicating it handles multiple responsibilities. The high WMC relative to the number of methods (41 WMC for 6 methods) suggests complex method implementations that could benefit from further decomposition."
