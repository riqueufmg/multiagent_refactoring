    "class": "(default package).LoopUnroll",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) and 125 lines of code (loc=125), with a Weighted Methods per Class of 31 (wmc=31). The high number of methods and lines of code, combined with the complexity indicated by WMC, suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
