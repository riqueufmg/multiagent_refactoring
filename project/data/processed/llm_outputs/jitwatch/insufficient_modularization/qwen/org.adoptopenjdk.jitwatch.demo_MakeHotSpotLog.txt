    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.demo.MakeHotSpotLog",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 39 methods (nom=39) and 331 lines of code (loc=331), indicating high implementation complexity. The weighted method count is 66 (wmc=66), suggesting significant computational complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no dependencies, the class appears to be doing too much work internally rather than delegating to other classes, suggesting insufficient decomposition of responsibilities."
