{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=43, nopm=32), high lines of code (loc=451), and a high weighted method count (wmc=97), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The low LCOM value (0.0465116279069767) indicates good cohesion, but the overall size and method count still suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce complexity."
