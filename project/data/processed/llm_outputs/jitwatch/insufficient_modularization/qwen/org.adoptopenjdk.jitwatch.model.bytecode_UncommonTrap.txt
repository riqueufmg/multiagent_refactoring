    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (52 lines of code, 7 methods) and low complexity (WMC=9). The LCOM value of 0.2857142857142857 indicates good cohesion among the methods. With only 4 fields and no public methods or fields, the class appears to be well-encapsulated and appropriately modularized for its size and complexity."
