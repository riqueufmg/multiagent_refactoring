    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BCAnnotationType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=1), and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). It also has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance (dit=0). This indicates a simple enum or minimal class that does not require further decomposition."
