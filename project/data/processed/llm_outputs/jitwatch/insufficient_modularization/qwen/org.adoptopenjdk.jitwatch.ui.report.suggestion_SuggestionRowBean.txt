    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 17 lines of code (loc=17), with a low weighted method count (wmc=8). The class also has a depth of inheritance of 2 (dit=2) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). These metrics indicate a small, simple class that is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
