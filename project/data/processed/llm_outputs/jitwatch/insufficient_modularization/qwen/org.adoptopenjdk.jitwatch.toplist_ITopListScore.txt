    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 4 lines of code (loc=4), which indicates minimal size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting simple method implementations. With only 2 fields (nof=0, nc=2) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this interface represents a well-encapsulated, minimal design that does not require further decomposition."
