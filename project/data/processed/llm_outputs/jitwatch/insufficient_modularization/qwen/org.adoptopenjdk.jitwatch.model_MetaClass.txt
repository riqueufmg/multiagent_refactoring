{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaClass",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 26 methods (nom) and 43 weighted method count (wmc), large size with 165 lines of code (loc), and multiple responsibilities indicated by dependencies on 6 different classes including ClassBC, JITDataModel, BytecodeLoader, IMetaMember, MemberSignatureParts, and MetaPackage. The high method count and diverse dependencies suggest the class handles multiple concerns and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused modules."
