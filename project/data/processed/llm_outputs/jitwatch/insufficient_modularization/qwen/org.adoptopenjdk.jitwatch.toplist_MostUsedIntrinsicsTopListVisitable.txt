    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.MostUsedIntrinsicsTopListVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 7 weighted method count (wmc=7), and 26 lines of code (loc=26). It has no fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and shows good cohesion with lcom=0.0. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality, with reasonable method count and complexity metrics that do not indicate insufficient modularization."
