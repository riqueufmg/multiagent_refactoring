    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 20 lines of code (loc=20), with a low weighted method count (wmc=6). These metrics indicate a small, simple class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it has not grown large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
