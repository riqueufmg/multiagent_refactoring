    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.IRuntime",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 3 public methods (nopm=3), with very low complexity (wmc=3) and minimal lines of code (loc=5). The low number of methods and low complexity indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits. The class appears to be a simple interface or minimal implementation that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
