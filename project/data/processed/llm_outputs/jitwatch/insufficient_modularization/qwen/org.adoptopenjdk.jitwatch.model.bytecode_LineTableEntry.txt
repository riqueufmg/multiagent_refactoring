    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields and 6 methods with 46 lines of code, indicating a small and focused class. The WMC of 11 suggests moderate complexity but is acceptable for a class of this size. The class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains a clear single responsibility."
