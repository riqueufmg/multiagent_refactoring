    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom) and 291 lines of code (loc), indicating a large and complex implementation. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 46 (wmc), suggesting high implementation complexity. With 20 fields (nof) and only 0.1666666666666666 LCOM (lack of cohesion), the class manages substantial state and functionality that could benefit from further decomposition to improve modularity and reduce complexity."
