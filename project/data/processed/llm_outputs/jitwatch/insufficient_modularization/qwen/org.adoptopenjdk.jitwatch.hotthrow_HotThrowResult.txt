    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow.HotThrowResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (51 LOC, 7 methods) and low complexity (WMC=18). It has clear responsibility with appropriate number of fields (4) and methods (7). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the single dependency suggests proper encapsulation. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears well-decomposed for its functionality."
