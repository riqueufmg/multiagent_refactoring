{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox.Sandbox",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 13 fields (nof=13), with a total of 258 lines of code (loc=258). The weighted method count (wmc=52) indicates high complexity. The class also has a high number of dependencies (15 external dependencies listed), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. These metrics indicate that the class is large and complex enough to benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more manageable modules."
