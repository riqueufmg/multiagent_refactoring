```json
{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Tag",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 21 methods (nom) and 46 weighted method count (wmc), large size with 177 lines of code (loc), and only 8 fields (nof) with no public fields (nopf=0). The high method count and weighted method complexity suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The low LCOM value (0.095) indicates good cohesion, but the overall size and complexity still indicate insufficient modularization."
