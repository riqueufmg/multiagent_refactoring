    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 25 methods (nom=25) and a high weighted method count (wmc=119), indicating high complexity. The lines of code (loc=541) suggest a large class that could benefit from decomposition. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.12) do not mitigate the complexity, and the numerous dependencies (19) indicate potential functional responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive modules."
