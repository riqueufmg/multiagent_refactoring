{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.zing.ZingLine",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 34 methods (nom=34) with 33 private methods (nopm=33), indicating a high concentration of functionality within a single class. The class has 147 lines of code (loc=147) and 14 fields (nof=14), suggesting it encapsulates substantial functionality that could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The high method count and significant lines of code indicate the class may be undertaking too many responsibilities and could benefit from further modularization to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
