    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.ClassSearch",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 10 methods (nom), 28 weighted method count (wmc), and 103 lines of code (loc). While it has some dependencies (4 fanout), the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would clearly warrant further decomposition. The lack of class hierarchy (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=4) suggest reasonable modularization."
