    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.inline.HeadlessInlineVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (144 LOC), reasonable number of methods (4), low complexity (WMC=9), and contains an inner class which suggests appropriate decomposition. The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates good cohesion, and the lack of fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggests it's not overly coupled. While further decomposition might be possible, the current modularization appears sufficient given the class's complexity and responsibilities."
