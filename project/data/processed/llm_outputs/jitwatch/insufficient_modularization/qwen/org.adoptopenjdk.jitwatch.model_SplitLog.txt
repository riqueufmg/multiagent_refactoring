    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.SplitLog",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (36 loc, 9 methods) and all methods are public (9/9), indicating clear interface exposure. The lack of fields (4 fields, 0 private) and zero complexity metrics (wmc=9, lcom=0.0, fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest a simple data holder or utility class rather than a complex class needing decomposition. The single dependency indicates minimal coupling."
