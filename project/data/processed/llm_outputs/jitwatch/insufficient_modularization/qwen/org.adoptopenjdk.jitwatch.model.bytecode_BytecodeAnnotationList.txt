{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeAnnotationList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods (nom=7) with all being public (nopm=7), 2 fields (nof=2), and 45 lines of code (loc=45). The weighted method count (wmc=13) indicates moderate complexity. While the class could potentially benefit from further decomposition, the metrics do not clearly indicate insufficient modularization as the size and complexity are within reasonable limits for a focused class handling bytecode annotation lists."
