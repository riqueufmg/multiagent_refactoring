    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=1) and 17 lines of code (loc=17), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 methods and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
