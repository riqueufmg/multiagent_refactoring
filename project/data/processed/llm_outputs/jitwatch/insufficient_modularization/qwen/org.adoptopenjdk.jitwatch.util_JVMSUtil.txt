    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.JVMSUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods (6 public) and WMC of 19, which is manageable. The LOC is 97 which is relatively small. LCOM of 0.25 indicates good cohesion within the class. The low number of fields (4 total, 0 public) and methods suggests the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
