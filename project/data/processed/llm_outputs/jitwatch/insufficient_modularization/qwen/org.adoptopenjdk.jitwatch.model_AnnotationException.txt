    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.AnnotationException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 3 fields (nof=3), and 29 lines of code (loc=29). The weighted method count (wmc=5) indicates minimal implementation complexity. With only 1 dependency and no fan-in or fan-out, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
