{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 47 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 19 which suggests the class is doing too much, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 181 which is substantial for a single class. The high WMC value particularly indicates that the class has complex method implementations that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
