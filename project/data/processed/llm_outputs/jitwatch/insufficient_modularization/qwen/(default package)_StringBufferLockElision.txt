    "class": "(default package).StringBufferLockElision",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 20 lines of code (loc=20), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies, the class appears to be well-focused and adequately modularized for its current functionality."
