    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 15 lines of code (loc=15) and all other metrics are zero or minimal (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0). There are no dependencies present. The class is already sufficiently modularized given its minimal size and complexity."
