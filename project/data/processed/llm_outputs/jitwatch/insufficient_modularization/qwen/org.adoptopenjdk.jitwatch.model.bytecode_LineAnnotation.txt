    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.LineAnnotation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods with a WMC of 18, which indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. With only 51 lines of code and 3 fields, the class is relatively small. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the single dependency indicates reasonable coupling. The metrics do not suggest that further decomposition would significantly reduce size or complexity."
