    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 37 methods (nom=37) and 475 lines of code (loc=475), indicating high implementation complexity and size. The weighted method count (wmc=85) further confirms high complexity. With 16 fields (nof=16) and multiple dependencies (6 external dependencies), this class handles significant functionality that could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
