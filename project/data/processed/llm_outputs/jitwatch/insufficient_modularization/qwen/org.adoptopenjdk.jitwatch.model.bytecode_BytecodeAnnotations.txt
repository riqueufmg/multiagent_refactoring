    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 4 public methods (nopm=4), with low complexity (wmc=5). The lines of code (loc=20) are minimal, indicating a well-focused, small class. There are no signs of excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed with a clear single responsibility."
