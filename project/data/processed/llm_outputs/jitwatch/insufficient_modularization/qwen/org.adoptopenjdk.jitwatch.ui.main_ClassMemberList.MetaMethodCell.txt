    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.ClassMemberList.MetaMethodCell",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 18 lines of code (loc=18). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies other than a single utility class. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal UI component that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization due to its small size and low complexity."
