    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with 7 being public (nopm=7), and a relatively small size of 69 lines of code (loc=69). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=8), indicating low complexity. With only 8 methods and modest size, this class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
