    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyInstruction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 15 methods (nom), 41 weighted method count (wmc), and 178 lines of code (loc). With 8 fields and only 2 dependencies, the class appears to have significant implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. The high WMC relative to the number of methods suggests complex method implementations, and the substantial LOC count indicates the class is handling multiple responsibilities that could benefit from modularization."
