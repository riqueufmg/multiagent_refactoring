    "class": "(default package).InliningChains",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 88 lines of code (loc=88), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=11) indicates low complexity. With only 2 public methods (nopm=2), the class has a clear and focused interface. The absence of fields (nof=0) and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests a simple utility-like structure rather than a complex, insufficiently modularized class."
