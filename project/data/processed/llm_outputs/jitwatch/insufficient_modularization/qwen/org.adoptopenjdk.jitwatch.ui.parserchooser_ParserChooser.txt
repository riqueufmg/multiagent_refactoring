    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 23 lines of code (loc=23), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and no class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
