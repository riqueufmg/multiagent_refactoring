    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 15 lines of code (loc=15), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class is well-encapsulated. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) further indicate a simple, well-isolated class that does not require further decomposition."
