{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.toplist.TopListWrapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4), 3 fields (nof=3), and 19 lines of code (loc=19). The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it is already well-decomposed. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class."
