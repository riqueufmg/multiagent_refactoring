    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic.IntrinsicFinder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=14, LOC=89, NOM=3) and shows good cohesion (LCOM=0.667). The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies suggests it's not heavily interconnected. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the current metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant classification as Insufficient Modularization."
