    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 20 lines of code (loc=20), which indicates a small and simple class. With 2 fields (nof=2) and no complex dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low method count and simple structure suggest it is already well-decomposed and does not require further decomposition to reduce size or complexity."
