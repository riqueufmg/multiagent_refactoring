    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.Dialogs",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15) and 21 weighted method count (wmc=21), with 183 lines of code (loc=183). It also contains nested classes (Dialogs.Response and Dialogs.Dialog) indicating potential for decomposition. The high method count and lines of code suggest the class could benefit from further modularization to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
