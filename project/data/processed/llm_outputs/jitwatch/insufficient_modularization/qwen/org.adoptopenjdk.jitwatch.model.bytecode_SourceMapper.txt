    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a reasonable size (70 LOC), moderate complexity (WMC=17), and good cohesion (LCOM=0.33). With only 6 methods and 2 fields, the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization. The metrics suggest a well-contained and focused class."
