    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.VmVersionDetector",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with all being private (nopm=2), 1 field (nof=1), and low complexity (wmc=11, loc=53). The LCOM value of 1.0 indicates good cohesion, and there are no inheritance relationships (dit=0) or external dependencies that would suggest insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
