    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 12 lines of code (loc=12), which indicates a small and simple class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=3), and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) or class coupling (nc=0, lcom=0.0). The class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already small and simple."
