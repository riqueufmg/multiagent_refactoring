    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.AbstractReportRowBean",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4), 15 lines of code (loc=15), and 4 fields (nof=1, nc=4). The LCOM value is 0.0 indicating good cohesion. The class has no fanin or fanout dependencies, suggesting it's relatively isolated but not overly complex. The metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized and cohesive."
