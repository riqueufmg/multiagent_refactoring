    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 86 methods (nom=86) and 568 lines of code (loc=568), indicating high size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=142) further confirms high implementation complexity. The class also contains 59 fields (nof=59) and has multiple inner classes (BackgroundCompilation, CompressedOops, OnStackReplacement, TieredCompilation) as dependencies, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
