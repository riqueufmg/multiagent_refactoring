    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6, nopm=6) and 29 lines of code (loc=29), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=8) is also low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 levels of inheritance (dit=2) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
