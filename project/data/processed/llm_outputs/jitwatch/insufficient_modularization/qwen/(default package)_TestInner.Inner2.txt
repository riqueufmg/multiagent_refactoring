    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 9 lines of code (loc=9). There are no signs of insufficient modularization as the class is already minimal and does not contain any substantial functionality that could be further decomposed. The class appears to be an empty or placeholder inner class."
