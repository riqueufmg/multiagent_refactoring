    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.NoOpLineListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 12 lines of code (loc=12), which indicates a very small and simple class. With 0 fields (nof=0) and no inheritance (dit=1), this class is already highly modularized and does not require further decomposition. The low complexity metrics suggest it is well within acceptable size and complexity limits."
