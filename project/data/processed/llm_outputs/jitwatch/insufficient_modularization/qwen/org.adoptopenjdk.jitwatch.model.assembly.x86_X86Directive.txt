    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 17 lines of code (loc=17), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is also low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
