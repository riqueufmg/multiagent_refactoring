    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (3 public), 40 lines of code, and WMC of 8. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and with only 3 fields and no public fields, the class appears to be well modularized. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
