    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 26 lines of code (loc=26), which is a very small size. The weighted method count (wmc=4) indicates low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no dependencies, this class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
