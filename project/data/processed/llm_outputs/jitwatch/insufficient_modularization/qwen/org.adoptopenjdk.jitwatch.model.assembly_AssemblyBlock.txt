    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (35 LOC) and complexity (WMC=10, NOM=8). The LCOM value of 0.25 indicates good cohesion, and there are only 2 fields with no public fields. The number of methods (8) and lack of inheritance (DIT=0) suggest appropriate modularization for its purpose."
