    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 16 methods (nom), 48 weighted method count (wmc), and 192 lines of code (loc). The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low cohesion (lcom=0.0) suggest it may be doing too much and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
