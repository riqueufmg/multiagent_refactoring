    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 36 lines of code (loc=36), with a low weighted method count (wmc=7). The low number of methods and relatively small size indicate sufficient modularization. No complex dependencies or high complexity metrics suggest the need for further decomposition."
