    "class": "(default package).TrivialMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 21 lines of code (loc=21), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to be well-contained and not overly complex. The LCOM value of 0.75 indicates some lack of cohesion, but given the small size and low complexity, further decomposition would likely be unnecessary and could lead to over-engineering rather than improved modularity."
