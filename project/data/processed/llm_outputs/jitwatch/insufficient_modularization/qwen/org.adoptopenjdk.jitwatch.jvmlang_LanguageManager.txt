    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with a weighted method count (wmc=43) indicating moderate complexity. It manages multiple language runtimes and compilers through dependencies on 16 external classes including various Compiler and Runtime implementations. The lines of code (loc=123) and lack of inheritance (dit=0, nof=2) suggest it could be decomposed into smaller specialized components to handle different language-specific logic, reducing its size and implementation complexity."
