    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 16 lines of code (loc=16), with a low weighted method count (wmc=4). These metrics indicate a small, simple class that does not require further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its minimal size and complexity."
