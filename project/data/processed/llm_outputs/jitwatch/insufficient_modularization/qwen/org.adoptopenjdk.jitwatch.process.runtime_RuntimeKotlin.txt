    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeKotlin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of fields (3), methods (4), and lines of code (35). The weighted method count (7) and lack of class complexity (0) indicate simple implementation complexity. The low coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) and reasonable LCOM value (0.5) suggest good cohesion. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized with a clear, focused responsibility."
