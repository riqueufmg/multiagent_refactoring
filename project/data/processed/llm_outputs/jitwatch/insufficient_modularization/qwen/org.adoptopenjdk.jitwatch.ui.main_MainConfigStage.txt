    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.MainConfigStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods (5 private) and WMC of 25, which is manageable. The LOC is 122 which is reasonable for a UI configuration stage class. The class has no nested classes (nc=0) and no inheritance (dit=0), indicating simple structure. LCOM of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class. The dependencies are typical for a UI configuration component interacting with file choosers, stage management, and core configuration."
