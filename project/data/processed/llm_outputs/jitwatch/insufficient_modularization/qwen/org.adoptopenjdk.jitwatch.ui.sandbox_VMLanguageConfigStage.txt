    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods and WMC of 16, but no clear indication of insufficient modularization. LCOM is 0.0 indicating good cohesion, and with only 97 lines of code, the class size is manageable. The method count and complexity metrics do not suggest the need for further decomposition."
