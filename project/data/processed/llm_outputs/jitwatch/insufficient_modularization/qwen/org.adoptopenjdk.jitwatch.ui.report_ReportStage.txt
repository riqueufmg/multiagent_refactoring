    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.ReportStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of fields (6), methods (5), and relatively low lines of code (86). The Weighted Method Count (WMC) is 19, which is moderate. The class has no nested classes (nc: 0) and no inheritance depth (dit: 0). While it has several dependencies (12), indicating some level of coupling, the internal complexity and size metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be reasonably decomposed given its scope."
