    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 19 lines of code (loc). It also has minimal dependencies with only 1 fanout dependency. The low metric values indicate proper modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
