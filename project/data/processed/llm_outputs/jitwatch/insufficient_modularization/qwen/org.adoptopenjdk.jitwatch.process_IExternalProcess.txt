    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.IExternalProcess",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2) and 4 lines of code (loc=4), which indicates a very small and simple class. The low number of methods and minimal code size suggest that further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity. The class appears to be appropriately modularized given its minimal scope and functionality."
