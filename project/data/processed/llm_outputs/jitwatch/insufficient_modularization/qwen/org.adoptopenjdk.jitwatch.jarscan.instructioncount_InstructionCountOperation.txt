    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5 total, 4 public), low lines of code (48), low weighted method count (9), and reasonable LCOM value (0.4). These metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further modularization."
