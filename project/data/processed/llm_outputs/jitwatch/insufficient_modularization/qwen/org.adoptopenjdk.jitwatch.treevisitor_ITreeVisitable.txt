    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2) and 4 lines of code (loc=4), which indicates a very small and simple interface. The lack of fields (nof=0) and minimal complexity suggest it is already well modularized. No further decomposition would be beneficial for such a lightweight interface."
