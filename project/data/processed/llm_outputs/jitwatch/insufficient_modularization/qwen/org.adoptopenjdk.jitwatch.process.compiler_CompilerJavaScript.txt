    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerJavaScript",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no class-level dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be appropriately modularized for its size and complexity. The lack of complex dependencies or excessive size/complexity metrics indicates sufficient modularization."
