    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm.ARMExtend",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=10) is also low, suggesting low implementation complexity. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (nof=1, nopf=0) further support that this class is sufficiently modularized."
