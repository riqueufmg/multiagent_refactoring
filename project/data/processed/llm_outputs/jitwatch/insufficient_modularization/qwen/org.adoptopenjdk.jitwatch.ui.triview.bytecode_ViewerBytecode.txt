    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.bytecode.ViewerBytecode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (17) and a high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) value of 60, indicating high complexity. The Lines of Code (LOC) is 276, which is relatively high for a single class. The class also has a low LCOM value (0.176), suggesting some cohesion but given the size and method count, it indicates potential for further decomposition to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
