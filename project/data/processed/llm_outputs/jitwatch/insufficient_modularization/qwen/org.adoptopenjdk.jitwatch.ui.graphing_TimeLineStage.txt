{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing.TimeLineStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 36 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 12, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 200. The class also has a DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) of 2 and contains 5 fields. The high WMC value relative to the number of methods suggests complex method implementations, and the substantial LOC count indicates the class is doing too much work without proper decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
