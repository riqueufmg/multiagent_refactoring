    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.EliminatedAllocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, nopm=5) and 20 lines of code (loc=20), which indicates a small and manageable size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=5), suggesting low complexity. With no fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and no dependencies, this class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
