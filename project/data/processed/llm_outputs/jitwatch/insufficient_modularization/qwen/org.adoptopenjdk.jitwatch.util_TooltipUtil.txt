    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 1 private method (nopm=1), 32 lines of code (loc=32), and weighted method count of 7 (wmc=7). These metrics indicate a very small and simple class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
