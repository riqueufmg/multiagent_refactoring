    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.inlining.InliningWalker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5 total, 3 public), low WMC (14), and reasonable size (52 LOC). The LCOM value of 0.6 indicates good cohesion, and the lack of fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggests it is not overly complex. While it has 2 fields and 3 inherited fields, the overall complexity and size do not indicate insufficient modularization."
