    "class": "(default package).Lambda",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 16 lines of code (loc=16), with a low weighted method count (wmc=2). These metrics indicate a very simple class that does not exhibit complexity requiring further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its minimal size and functionality."
