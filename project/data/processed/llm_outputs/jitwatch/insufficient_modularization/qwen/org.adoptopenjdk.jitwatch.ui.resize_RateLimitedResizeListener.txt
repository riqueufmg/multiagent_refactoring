    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize.RateLimitedResizeListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 10 weighted method count (wmc=10), and 48 lines of code (loc=48). The lack of fields (nof=5, all private) and low method count indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a focused listener implementation with a single responsibility."
