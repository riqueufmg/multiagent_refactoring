    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.IBytecodeParam",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 3 lines of code (loc=3), and a single weighted method count (wmc=1). The lack of fields (nof=0) and minimal method count indicate this is a simple interface or very basic class that does not require further decomposition. The low complexity metrics suggest sufficient modularization has already been achieved."
