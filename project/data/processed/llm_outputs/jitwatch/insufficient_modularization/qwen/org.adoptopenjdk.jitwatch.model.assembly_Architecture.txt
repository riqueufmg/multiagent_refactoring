{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.Architecture",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 6 fields (nof=6), 19 lines of code (loc=19), and weighted method count of 8 (wmc=8). The lack of methods (nopm=1 indicates 0 public methods) and minimal dependencies (only 1 fanout) suggests it is already well-decomposed. The class appears to be a simple data structure or enum-like class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
