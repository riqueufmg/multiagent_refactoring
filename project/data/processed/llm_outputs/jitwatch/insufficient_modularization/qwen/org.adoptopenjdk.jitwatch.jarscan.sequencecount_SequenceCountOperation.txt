    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount.SequenceCountOperation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) with 7 public methods (nopm=7), and a Weighted Method Count of 34 (wmc=34), indicating high complexity. The class also has 105 lines of code (loc=105) which is substantial for a single class. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be doing too much work with relatively few data elements, suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The high WMC and method count relative to the small number of fields indicates insufficient modularization."
