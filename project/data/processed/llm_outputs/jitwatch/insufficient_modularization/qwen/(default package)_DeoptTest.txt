    "class": "(default package).DeoptTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5), 8 weighted method count (wmc=8), and 36 lines of code (loc=36). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.4) indicates proper modularization. The size and complexity metrics do not suggest the need for further decomposition."
