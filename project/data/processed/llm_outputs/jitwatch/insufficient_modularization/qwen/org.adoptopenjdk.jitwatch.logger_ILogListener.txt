    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0), 4 lines of code (loc=4), and a low weighted method count (wmc=2). The low number of methods and lines of code indicate that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
