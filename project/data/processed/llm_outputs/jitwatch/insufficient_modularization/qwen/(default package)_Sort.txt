    "class": "(default package).Sort",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (42 LOC, 5 methods, 3 fields) and reasonable complexity (WMC=10). The LCOM value of 0.4 indicates good cohesion. There are no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), suggesting the class is self-contained. The number of methods and fields is relatively balanced, and there's no indication of multiple responsibilities or excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
