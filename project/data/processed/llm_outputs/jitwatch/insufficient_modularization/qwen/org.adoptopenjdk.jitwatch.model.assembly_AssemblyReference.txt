{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyReference",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods with a WMC of 32, indicating moderate complexity. While it has 16 fields, the LCOM value of 0.1818181818181818 suggests good cohesion within the class. The LOC of 216 is reasonable for a class with this level of functionality. There are no external dependencies that indicate poor modularization, and the class appears to have a single, well-defined responsibility related to assembly references."
