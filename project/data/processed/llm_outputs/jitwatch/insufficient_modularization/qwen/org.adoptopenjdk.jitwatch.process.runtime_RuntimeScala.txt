    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeScala",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 4 public), low lines of code (32), low weighted method count (7), and reasonable lack of cohesion (0.5). These metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
