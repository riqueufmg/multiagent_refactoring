    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (100 loc, 6 methods) and complexity (WMC=31), with good cohesion (LCOM=0.33). The low number of fields (1) and methods (6) suggests focused responsibility. While further decomposition could theoretically be possible, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant decomposition for modularity improvement."
