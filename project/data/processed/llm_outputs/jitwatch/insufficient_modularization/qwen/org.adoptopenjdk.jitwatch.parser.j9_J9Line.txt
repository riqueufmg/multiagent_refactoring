    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.j9.J9Line",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19, nopm=19) and 143 lines of code (loc=143), indicating high implementation complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=22) further confirms the high complexity. With 9 fields (nof=9) and 3 public fields (nopf=3), the class encapsulates significant data and behavior that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
