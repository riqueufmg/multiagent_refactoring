    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 1 line of code (loc=1). It has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance (dit=0). The class is already highly decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it contains minimal functionality that would benefit from further decomposition."
