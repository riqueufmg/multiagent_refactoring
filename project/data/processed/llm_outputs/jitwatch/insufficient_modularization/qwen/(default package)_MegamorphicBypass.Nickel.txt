    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code (loc), 0 methods (nom), 0 fields (nof), and a Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) of 0. All metrics indicate minimal size and implementation complexity, suggesting the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
