{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 6 lines of code (loc=30), and low weighted method count (wmc=6). The lack of fields (nof=1) and parameters (nopf=0, nopm=4) indicates simple structure. LCOM value of 0.75 suggests good cohesion within the class. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be appropriately decomposed with manageable size and complexity."
