    "class": "(default package).EscapeTestManyFields",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 41 fields (nof=41) which indicates a high level of data complexity and suggests insufficient decomposition. With only 2 methods (nom=2) to handle 41 fields, the class likely violates the single responsibility principle and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity. The high field count relative to method count indicates the class is managing too much state without adequate behavioral decomposition."
