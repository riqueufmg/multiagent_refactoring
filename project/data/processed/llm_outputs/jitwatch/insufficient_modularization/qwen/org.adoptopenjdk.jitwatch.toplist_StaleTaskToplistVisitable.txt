{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.StaleTaskToplistVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 8 weighted method count (wmc=8), 28 lines of code (loc=28), and no class-level attributes (nof=1, nc=0). The low method count, low weighted method complexity, and small size indicate sufficient modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion among the methods."
