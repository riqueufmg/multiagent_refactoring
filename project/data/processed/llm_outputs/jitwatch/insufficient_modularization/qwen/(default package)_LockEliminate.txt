    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 22 lines of code (loc=22), and a low weighted method count (wmc=5). These metrics indicate a relatively small and simple class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
