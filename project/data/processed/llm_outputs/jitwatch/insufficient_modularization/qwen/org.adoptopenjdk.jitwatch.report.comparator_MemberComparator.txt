    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 5 lines of code (loc=5), which indicates minimal complexity and size. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=1) is also very low, suggesting simple implementation complexity. With such minimal functionality, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or complexity."
