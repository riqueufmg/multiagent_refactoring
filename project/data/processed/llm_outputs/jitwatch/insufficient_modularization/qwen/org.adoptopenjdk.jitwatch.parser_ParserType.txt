    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.ParserType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 19 lines of code (loc=19), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=9) is also low, suggesting minimal implementation complexity. With such a small size and low complexity, there is no indication that further decomposition would provide benefits, making this a well-modularized class rather than exhibiting insufficient modularization."
