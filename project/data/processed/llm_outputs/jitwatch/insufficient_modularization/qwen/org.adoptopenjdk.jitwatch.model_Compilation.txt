    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 39 methods (nom), 71 weighted methods (wmc), and 280 lines of code (loc). The high number of methods and weighted method count suggest the class is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.1025641025641025) further support that this class has not been properly decomposed into specialized components."
