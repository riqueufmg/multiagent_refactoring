    "class": "(default package).MegamorphicBypass.Dime",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code, no fields, no methods, and no dependencies. There is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly simplified and does not exhibit characteristics of being incompletely decomposed."
