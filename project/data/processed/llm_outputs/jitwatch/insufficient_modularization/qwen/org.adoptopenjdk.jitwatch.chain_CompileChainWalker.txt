    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 5 methods (3 public), 117 lines of code, and WMC of 18. While it has some dependencies (7), the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be reasonably modularized for its functionality."
