    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 11 methods (nom=11) and 17 lines of code (loc=17), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=11) is also low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 public method (nopm=0) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), this interface appears to be properly modularized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
