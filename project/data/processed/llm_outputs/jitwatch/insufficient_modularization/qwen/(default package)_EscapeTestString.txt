    "class": "(default package).EscapeTestString",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with low complexity (wmc=5), 3 fields (nof=3), and 50 lines of code (loc=50). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low LCOM value (1.0) indicates good cohesion. The size and complexity are within acceptable limits for a well-modularized class."
