    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (35), a high number of fields (17), and a high WMC (80), indicating high complexity. The class also has a low LCOM value (0.057), which suggests that the methods are cohesive, but the overall size and complexity suggest that further decomposition could reduce its size and implementation complexity."
