    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 19 methods (nom), 30 weighted methods (wmc), and 199 lines of code (loc). It also has a high number of fields (23 nof) and dependencies to 7 external classes, indicating it may be doing too much and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
