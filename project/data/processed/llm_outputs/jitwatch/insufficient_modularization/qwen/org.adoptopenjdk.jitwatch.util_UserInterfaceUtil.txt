    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 14 methods and WMC of 29, which is within acceptable limits for a utility class. The LOC is 144 which is reasonable for a utility class with 9 fields. LCOM of 0.428 indicates reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be a focused utility class with a single responsibility related to user interface operations, and there's no clear indication that further decomposition would significantly reduce complexity or improve maintainability."
