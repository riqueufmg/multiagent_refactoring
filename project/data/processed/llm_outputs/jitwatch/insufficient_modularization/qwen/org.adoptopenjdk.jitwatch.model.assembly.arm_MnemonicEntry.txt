    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm.MnemonicEntry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 2 fields (nof=2), and 8 lines of code (loc=8). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity, indicates that further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current scope and responsibilities."
