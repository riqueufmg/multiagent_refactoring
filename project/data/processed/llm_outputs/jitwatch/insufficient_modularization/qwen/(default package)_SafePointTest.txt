{
    "class": "(default package).SafePointTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 22 lines of code (loc=22), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class does not exhibit characteristics of insufficient modularization. The LCOM value of 0.6666666666666666 suggests some cohesion issues but given the small size and low complexity, further decomposition would not provide significant benefits."
