    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.locks.OptimisedLockRowBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a reasonable size with 69 lines of code and 8 methods, which does not indicate excessive complexity. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 8, matching the number of methods, suggesting simple method complexity. With 7 public methods out of 8 total methods, the class appears to have a clear, focused responsibility. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's relatively isolated but not necessarily insufficiently modularized. No clear indicators of internal complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
