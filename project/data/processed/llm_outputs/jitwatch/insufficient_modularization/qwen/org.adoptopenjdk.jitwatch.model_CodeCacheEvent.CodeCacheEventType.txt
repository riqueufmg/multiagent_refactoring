    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 1 line of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 dependencies. The metrics indicate it is a simple enum or data class that does not require further decomposition. WMC is 0, NOM is 0, and there are no fan-in or fan-out dependencies suggesting minimal functional complexity."
