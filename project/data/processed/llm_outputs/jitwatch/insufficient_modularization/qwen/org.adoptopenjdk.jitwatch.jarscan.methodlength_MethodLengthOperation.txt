    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.methodlength.MethodLengthOperation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (57 LOC) and complexity (WMC=9) for its 4 methods. The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates moderate cohesion, and DIT=1 shows it's not deeply inherited. The low number of fields (2) and methods (4) suggests appropriate modularization without excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
