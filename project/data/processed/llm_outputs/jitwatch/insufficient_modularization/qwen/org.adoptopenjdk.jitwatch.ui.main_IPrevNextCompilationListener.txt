    "justification": "This is an interface with only 2 methods (nom=2), 0 fields (nof=0), and 4 lines of code (loc=4). The low number of methods and fields indicates proper modularization. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=2) is also low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 class dependency (nc=1) and no inheritance (dit=0), this interface is sufficiently modularized and does not exhibit the Insufficient Modularization smell."
