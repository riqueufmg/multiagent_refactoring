    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.NothingMountedStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3) and 44 lines of code (loc=44), which indicates a small and simple class. With 0 fields (nof=0) and 0 public methods (nopm=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit complexity that would require further modularization. The low method count and small size suggest sufficient modularization has been achieved."
