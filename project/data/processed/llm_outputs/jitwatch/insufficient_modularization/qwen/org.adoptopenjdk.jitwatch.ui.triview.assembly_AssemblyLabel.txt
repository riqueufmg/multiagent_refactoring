    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly.AssemblyLabel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 10 lines of code (loc=10), which indicates a very small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class-level dependencies (nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to be well-decomposed and maintains a single responsibility. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0) further support that this is a properly modularized, simple class that does not require further decomposition."
