    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 14 methods and 73 lines of code. The WMC of 20 indicates reasonable method complexity. LCOM of 0.357 suggests good cohesion within the class. The number of fields (7) and methods (14) are within acceptable ranges for a single class responsibility. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies indicate limited external coupling. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
