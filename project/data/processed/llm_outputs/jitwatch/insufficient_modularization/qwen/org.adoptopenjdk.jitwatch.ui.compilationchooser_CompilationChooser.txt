{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser.CompilationChooser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 6 public), low lines of code (48), low weighted method count (11), and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The lack of complexity metrics (nof=4, nopf=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=0.0) indicates minimal internal complexity. These metrics suggest the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
