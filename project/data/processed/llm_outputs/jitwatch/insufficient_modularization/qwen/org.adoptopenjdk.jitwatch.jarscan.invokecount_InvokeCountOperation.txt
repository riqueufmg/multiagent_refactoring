    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.invokecount.InvokeCountOperation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 2 fields (nof=2), and low lines of code (loc=27). The weighted method count (wmc=10) indicates low implementation complexity. The class has a depth of inheritance of 1 (dit=1) and no children (nc=0), suggesting it's a leaf class that is appropriately specialized. The lack of coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0) indicate good modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed given its simple responsibilities."
