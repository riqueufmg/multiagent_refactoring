    "justification": "Class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 50 lines of code (loc=50), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=5) indicates low complexity. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already appropriately sized and decomposed."
