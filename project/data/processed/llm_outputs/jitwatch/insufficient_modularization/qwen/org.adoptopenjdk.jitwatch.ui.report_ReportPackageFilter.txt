    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.ReportPackageFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 21 lines of code (loc=21), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. The class has only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), indicating proper encapsulation. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance (dit=0) suggests a simple, well-encapsulated class that is appropriately modularized for its size and complexity."
