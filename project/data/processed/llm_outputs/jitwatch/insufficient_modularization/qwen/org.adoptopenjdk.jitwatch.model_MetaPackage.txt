    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaPackage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (89 LOC, 16 methods) and low complexity (WMC=23). The LCOM value of 0.125 indicates good cohesion, suggesting the class is well-modularized. There are no external dependencies or fan-in/fan-out connections that would indicate insufficient modularization. The number of fields (5) and methods (16) are within reasonable limits for a single cohesive unit."
