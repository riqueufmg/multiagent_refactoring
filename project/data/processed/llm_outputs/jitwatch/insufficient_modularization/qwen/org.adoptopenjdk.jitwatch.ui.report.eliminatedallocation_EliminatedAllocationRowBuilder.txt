    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (69 LOC) and complexity (WMC=8, NOM=8). The high number of private methods (7 out of 8 methods) suggests good internal encapsulation. No external dependencies or fan-in/fan-out indicate focused responsibility. The class appears to be well-modularized for its current functionality."
