    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 1 public), low lines of code (36), low weighted method count (9), and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low complexity metrics and minimal dependencies indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
