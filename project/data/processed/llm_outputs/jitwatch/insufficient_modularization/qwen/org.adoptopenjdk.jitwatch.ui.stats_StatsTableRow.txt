    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 3 fields (nof=3), with low complexity (wmc=3, loc=15). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and there are no dependencies or inheritance (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The class size and complexity are appropriate for its functionality, showing no signs of insufficient modularization."
