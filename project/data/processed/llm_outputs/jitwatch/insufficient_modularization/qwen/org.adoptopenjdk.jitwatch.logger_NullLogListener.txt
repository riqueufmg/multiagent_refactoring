    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.NullLogListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), very low complexity (wmc=2, loc=6), no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), and is not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy (dit=1). This is a simple, well-focused class that implements the Null Object pattern and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
