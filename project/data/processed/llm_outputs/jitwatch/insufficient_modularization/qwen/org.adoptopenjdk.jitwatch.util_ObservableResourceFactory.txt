    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.ObservableResourceFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (7), low lines of code (36), and low weighted method count (9), indicating it is already well modularized. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (nof=1, nopf=0) suggest it is appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
