    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 1 method, 8 lines of code, and a WMC of 2. The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple abstract base class with minimal responsibilities, showing no signs of insufficient modularization."
