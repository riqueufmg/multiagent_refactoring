    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo.Histo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods with a WMC of 15, which indicates moderate complexity. The LCOM value of 0.333 suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 77 lines of code and 5 fields, the class is relatively small and manageable. The absence of dependencies and low fanout/fanin values indicate it's not overly connected. While there might be room for some decomposition, the current size and complexity do not constitute insufficient modularization."
