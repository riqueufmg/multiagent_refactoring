    "class": "(default package).EscapeTestUnboxing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with all being public (nopm=2), 16 lines of code (loc=16), and weighted method count of 4 (wmc=4). These metrics indicate a very small and simple class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low complexity and small size suggest it is appropriately decomposed for its current functionality."
