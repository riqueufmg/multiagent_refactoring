    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 42 methods (nom), 92 weighted method count (wmc), 386 lines of code (loc), and 24 fields (nof). These metrics suggest the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
