    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.cell.LinkedBCICell",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 3 public), low lines of code (30), and low weighted method count (7), indicating it is already well-decomposed and not overly complex. The lack of class dependencies (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) and low coupling metrics (lcom=0.0) suggest proper modularization. No evidence of insufficient modularization detected."
