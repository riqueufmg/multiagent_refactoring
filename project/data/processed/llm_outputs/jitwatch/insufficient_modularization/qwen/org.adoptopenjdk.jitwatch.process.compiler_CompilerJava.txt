{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerJava",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 6 lines of code (loc=31), and low weighted method count (wmc=6). The lack of fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate proper modularization. The depth of inheritance (dit=2) and lack of children (nc=0) suggest appropriate inheritance structure. LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion among methods."
