    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyProcessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 46 and LOC of 186, indicating it is doing too much work. It has 8 methods with 7 being public, suggesting multiple responsibilities. The class has 10 fields and 0 private fields, indicating poor encapsulation and potential data exposure. LCOM of 0.25 suggests some cohesion issues. The class depends on 9 other classes, indicating it coordinates multiple external components. These metrics suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused modules."
