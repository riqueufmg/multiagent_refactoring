    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeGroovy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 5 public), low lines of code (45), low weighted method count (9), and reasonable lack of cohesion (0.5). The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality, showing no indicators of insufficient modularization."
