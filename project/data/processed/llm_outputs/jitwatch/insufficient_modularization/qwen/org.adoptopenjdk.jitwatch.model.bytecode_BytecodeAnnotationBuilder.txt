{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeAnnotationBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC=97 and LOC=474, contains 27 methods (NOM=27) and 9 fields (NOF=9). It also has a large number of dependencies (21), indicating high responsibility and potential violation of single responsibility principle. These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
