    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.AbstractCompilationWalker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3) and 11 lines of code (loc=11). The low number of methods and small size indicate sufficient modularization. The LCOM value of 0.667 suggests some cohesion issues but given the small size and method count, further decomposition would not be beneficial. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
