    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.codecache.CodeCacheEventWalker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4) and 9 weighted method count (wmc=9). The lines of code (loc=44) are relatively small. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests limited responsibility scope. While it has 2 fields (nof=2) and 4 public methods (nopm=4), the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
