    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriViewNavigationStack",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of fields (3), methods (5), and lines of code (44). The weighted method count (15) indicates moderate complexity but is not excessive for this size of class. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest a simple, focused class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
