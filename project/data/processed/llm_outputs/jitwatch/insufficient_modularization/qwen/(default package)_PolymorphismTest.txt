    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 43 lines of code (loc=43), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization as it appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
