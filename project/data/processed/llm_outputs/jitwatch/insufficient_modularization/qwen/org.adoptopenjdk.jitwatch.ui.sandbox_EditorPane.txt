    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.EditorPane",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19) with 36 weighted method complexity (wmc=36), indicating high implementation complexity. The class also has 10 fields (nof=10) and 184 lines of code (loc=184), suggesting it may be handling too many responsibilities. The high WMC value relative to the number of methods indicates complex method implementations that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes or components."
