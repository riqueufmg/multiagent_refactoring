    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.ClassBC",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 23 methods (nom=23) and 40 weighted methods (wmc=40), with 134 lines of code (loc=134). While the class has a moderate number of methods, the metrics do not indicate excessive complexity or size that would clearly warrant further decomposition. The low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and reasonable LCOM value (0.304) suggest the class is reasonably cohesive and not overly complex."
