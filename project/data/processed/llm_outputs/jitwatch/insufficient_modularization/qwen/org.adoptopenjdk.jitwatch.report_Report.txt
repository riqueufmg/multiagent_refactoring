    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods with a WMC of 28, which indicates moderate complexity. The LOC is 80, which is relatively small. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class. The number of fields (7) and methods (12) are within reasonable limits for a single class. There are no external dependencies that would suggest a need for further decomposition. The class appears to be well-structured and appropriately sized for its responsibilities."
