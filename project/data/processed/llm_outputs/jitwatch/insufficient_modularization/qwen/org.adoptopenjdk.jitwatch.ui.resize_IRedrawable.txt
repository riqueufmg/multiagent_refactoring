    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 3 lines of code (loc=3), which indicates minimal complexity and size. The lack of fields (nof=0) and very low structural complexity metrics (lcom=-1.0, nc=3) suggest this is a simple interface or minimal class that does not require further decomposition."
