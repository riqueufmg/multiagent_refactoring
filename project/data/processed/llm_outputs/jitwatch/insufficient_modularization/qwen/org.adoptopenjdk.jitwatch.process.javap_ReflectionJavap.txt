{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.javap.ReflectionJavap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (94 loc, 5 methods, 6 fields) and low complexity (WMC=12). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and there are no external dependencies or fanout connections that would suggest insufficient modularization. The metrics do not indicate the class needs further decomposition."
