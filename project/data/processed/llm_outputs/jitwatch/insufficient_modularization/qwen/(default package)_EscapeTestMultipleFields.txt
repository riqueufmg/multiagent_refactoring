    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (both public), 7 fields, 58 lines of code, and WMC of 5. The LCOM value of 1.0 indicates good cohesion. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it has a manageable size and complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
