    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencesearch.FoundSequence",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (48 LOC, 6 methods) and low complexity (WMC=13). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the absence of inheritance (DIT=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest appropriate modularization. No evidence of insufficient decomposition based on the provided metrics."
