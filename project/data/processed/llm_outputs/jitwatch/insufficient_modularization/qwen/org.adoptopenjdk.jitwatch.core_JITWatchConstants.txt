    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConstants",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 283 fields and 282 public static final fields, indicating it is a constants class with excessive number of fields that could be better decomposed into multiple specialized constant classes. The high field count (nof=283) and public static final field count (nopf=282) suggest insufficient modularization as these constants could be grouped into related categories or modules rather than being all contained in a single class."
