    "justification": "The class has only 12 methods (nom=12) and 14 lines of code (loc=14), which is relatively small. It has 0 fields (nof=0) and 0 private methods (nopm=0), indicating minimal complexity. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 12, which is moderate for the number of methods. The class appears to be a well-defined interface with appropriate responsibilities, and there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
