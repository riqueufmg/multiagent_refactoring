    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyReference.AssemblyReferenceHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 fields and 0 methods, with 80 lines of code. While the LOC count is moderate, the low number of fields and absence of methods indicates minimal complexity. There are no dependencies, and the structural complexity metrics (WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0) all suggest low complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal handler without sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition."
