{
    "class": "(default package).UpperCase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 40 lines of code (loc=40), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=9) is also low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 2 public methods (nopm=2), the class does not exhibit excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's a simple, self-contained class."
