{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.ILineListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 8 lines of code (loc=8), which indicates a small and simple class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=5), and there are only 2 nested classes (nc=2). These metrics suggest the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
