{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 36 lines of code (loc=36) and weighted method count of 12 (wmc=12), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The class has 1 field (nof=1) and 0 nested classes (nc=0), suggesting minimal complexity. The low number of methods and fields, combined with the absence of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicates that the class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
