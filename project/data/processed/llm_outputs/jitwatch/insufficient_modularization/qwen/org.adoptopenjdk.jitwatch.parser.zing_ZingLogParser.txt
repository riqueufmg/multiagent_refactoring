    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.zing.ZingLogParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 43 which is high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 230 indicating a large class size, NOM (Number of Methods) is 12 which contributes to complexity, and the class has 7 fields. The combination of high WMC, significant LOC, and multiple methods suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
