    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.invokecount.InvokeMethodCountMap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with all being public (nopm=2), 1 field (nof=1), and low complexity (wmc=4, loc=20). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity metrics, indicates the class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
