    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing.HistoStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3) and 7 weighted method count (wmc=7), small size with 85 lines of code (loc=85), and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion, and the depth of inheritance (dit=2) is reasonable. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
