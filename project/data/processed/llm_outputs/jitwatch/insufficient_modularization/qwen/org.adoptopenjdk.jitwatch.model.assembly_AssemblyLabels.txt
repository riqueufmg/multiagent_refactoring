    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyLabels",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (69 loc, 5 methods, 5 fields) and low complexity (WMC=14). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and there are no fan-in or fan-out dependencies suggesting it's not overly connected to other classes. The metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
