    "justification": "The class has moderate size (95 LOC, 5 methods, 8 fields) and low complexity (WMC=10). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the absence of inheritance (DIT=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest reasonable modularization. No clear indicators of insufficient decomposition are present."
