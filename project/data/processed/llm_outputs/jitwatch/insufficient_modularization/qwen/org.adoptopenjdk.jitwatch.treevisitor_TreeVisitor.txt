    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 23 lines of code (loc=23), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=7) indicates low complexity. With minimal methods and low complexity, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
