    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencesearch.SequenceSearchOperation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 35 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 8, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 116. The class contains multiple responsibilities including sequence searching operations, bytecode instruction handling, and result processing. The LCOM value of 0.25 suggests some cohesion issues. With 3 fields and 8 methods in a single class of 116 lines, the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
