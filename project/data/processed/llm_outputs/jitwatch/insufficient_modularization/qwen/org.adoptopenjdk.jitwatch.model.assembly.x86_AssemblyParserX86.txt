    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.x86.AssemblyParserX86",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 37 which is high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 160 indicating a large class size, and it contains 7 methods (NOM) with all being public methods (NOPM = 7), suggesting the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
