    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.AbstractReportBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=4, NOM=4, LOC=18) and a reasonable number of fields (NOF=2). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the depth of inheritance (DIT=2) is minimal. With only 4 methods and 18 lines of code, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
