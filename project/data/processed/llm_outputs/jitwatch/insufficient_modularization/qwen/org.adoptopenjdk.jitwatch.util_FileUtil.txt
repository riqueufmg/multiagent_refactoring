    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.FileUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with 6 public methods (nopm=6), and a weighted method count of 25 (wmc=25), indicating high complexity. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low cohesion (lcom=0.625) suggest this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce implementation complexity and improve modularity."
