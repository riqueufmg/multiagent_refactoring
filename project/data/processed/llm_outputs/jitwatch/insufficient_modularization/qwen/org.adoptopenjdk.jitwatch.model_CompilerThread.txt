    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.CompilerThread",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 78 lines of code (loc=78), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=22) suggests moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would require further decomposition. The lack of fields (nof=3, nopf=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate good separation of concerns. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class."
