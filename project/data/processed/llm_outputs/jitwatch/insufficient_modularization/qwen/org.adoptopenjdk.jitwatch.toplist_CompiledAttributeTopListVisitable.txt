    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 13 lines of code (loc=13) and low complexity (wmc=3). It has no fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and follows a simple visitor pattern implementation. The low method count, small size, and minimal complexity indicate proper modularization without need for further decomposition."
