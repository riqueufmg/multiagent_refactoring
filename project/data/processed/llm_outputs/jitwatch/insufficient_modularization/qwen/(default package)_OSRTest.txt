    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 22 lines of code (loc=22), with a low weighted method count (wmc=6). These metrics indicate a small, simple class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it has been adequately decomposed for its size and complexity."
