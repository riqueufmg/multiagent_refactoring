    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 25 lines of code (loc=25), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
