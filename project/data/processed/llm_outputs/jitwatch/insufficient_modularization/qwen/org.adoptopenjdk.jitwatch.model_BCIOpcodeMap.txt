    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 0 methods, 3 lines of code, and 0 weighted method count. While it could potentially be decomposed further, its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple data structure or configuration class that is already appropriately minimal."
