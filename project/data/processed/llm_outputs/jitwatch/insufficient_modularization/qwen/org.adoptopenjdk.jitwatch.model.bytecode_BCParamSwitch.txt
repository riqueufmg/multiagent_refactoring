    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BCParamSwitch",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6), 8 weighted method count (wmc=8), and 35 lines of code (loc=35). The lack of fields (nof=1, nc=0) and simple structure (dit=1, lcom=0.333) indicates proper modularization. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies suggest this is a simple, well-contained class that does not require further decomposition."
