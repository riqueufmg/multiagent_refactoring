    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (7 total, 6 public), low lines of code (36), low weighted method count (10), and no fields. The depth of inheritance is minimal (2) and there are no dependencies on other classes. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized with a focused responsibility."
