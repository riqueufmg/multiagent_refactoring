    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is a simple interface with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=0), 3 lines of code (loc=3), and minimal complexity (wmc=1). It serves a single, well-defined purpose as a listener interface and is already properly decomposed. The low metrics indicate it is appropriately modularized rather than insufficiently modularized."
