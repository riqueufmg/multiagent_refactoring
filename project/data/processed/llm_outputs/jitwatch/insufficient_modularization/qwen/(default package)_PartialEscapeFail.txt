    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 30 lines of code (loc=30), with a low weighted method count (wmc=4). These metrics indicate a relatively small and simple class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its complexity."
