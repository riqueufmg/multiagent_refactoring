{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.CompilationUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) with a weighted method count of 54 (wmc=54), indicating high complexity. The lines of code is 224 (loc=224) which is substantial for a single class. The class has 2 fields (nof=2) and 10 public methods (nopm=10), suggesting it may be doing too much work and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high WMC and method count suggest the class has not been completely decomposed."
