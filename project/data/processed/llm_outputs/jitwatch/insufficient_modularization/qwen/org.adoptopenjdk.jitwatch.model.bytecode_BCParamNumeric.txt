    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BCParamNumeric",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3), 12 lines of code (loc=12), and 1 field (nof=1). All methods are public (nopm=3) and there are no private fields (nopf=0). The class has good cohesion (lcom=0.0) and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The size and complexity are appropriate for a simple data class representing numeric bytecode parameters."
