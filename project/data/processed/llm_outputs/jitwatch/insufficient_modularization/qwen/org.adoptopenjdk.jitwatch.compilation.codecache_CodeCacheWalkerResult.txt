    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (44 lines of code, 8 methods) and low complexity (WMC=9). The LCOM value of 0.25 indicates good cohesion, and the lack of fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggests simple usage patterns. No evidence of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
