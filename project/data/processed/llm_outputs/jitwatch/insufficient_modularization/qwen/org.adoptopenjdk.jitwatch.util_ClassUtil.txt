    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.ClassUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods (nom) and 11 weighted method count (wmc), 42 lines of code (loc) which is relatively small. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (lcom=0.5714285714285714) suggest reasonable modularization. The single dependency indicates focused responsibility. While further decomposition could be possible, the current size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization."
