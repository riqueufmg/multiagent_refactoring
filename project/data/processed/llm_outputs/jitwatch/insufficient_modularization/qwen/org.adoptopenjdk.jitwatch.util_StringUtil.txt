    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 29 methods (nom=29) with 28 being public (nopm=28), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The weighted method count (wmc=72) suggests high complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 0 package dependencies, this class appears to be a utility class handling various string operations that could potentially be decomposed into more focused classes based on functionality groups. The high method count and complexity suggest insufficient modularization where related methods could be grouped into separate, more cohesive classes."
