    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
