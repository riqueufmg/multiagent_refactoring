{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.ResourceLoader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods (nom=7) with 6 being public (nopm=6), and a moderate WMC of 23. The LOC is 107 which is reasonable for a focused utility class. The LCOM value of 0.286 suggests good cohesion, and the class has minimal external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The metrics indicate a well-contained, cohesive class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
