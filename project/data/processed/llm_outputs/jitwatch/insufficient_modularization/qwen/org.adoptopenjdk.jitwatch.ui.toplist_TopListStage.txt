{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.toplist.TopListStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods (6 public) and WMC of 16, which is manageable. The LCOM value of 0.222 indicates good cohesion within the class. With only 110 lines of code and 4 fields, the class size is reasonable. The class appears to have a single, well-defined responsibility related to UI functionality for top lists, and there's no clear indication that further decomposition would significantly reduce complexity or improve maintainability."
