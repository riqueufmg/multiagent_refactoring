    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and a weighted method count of 60 (wmc=60), with 303 lines of code (loc=303). It also directly depends on 12 external classes (dependencies count=12), indicating high complexity and responsibility. The lack of any inherited depth (dit=0) and absence of fan-in or fan-out metrics suggest it's not leveraging inheritance or clear interaction patterns, which combined with its size and method count, points to insufficient decomposition of responsibilities."
