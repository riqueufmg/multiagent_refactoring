    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.OSUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 44 lines of code (loc=44), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=11) is relatively low, suggesting low implementation complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no nested classes (nc=0), the class does not exhibit characteristics of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
