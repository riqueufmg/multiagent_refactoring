    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm.ARMRegisterType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom), 10 weighted method count (wmc), 33 lines of code (loc), and 2 fields (nof). The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest a simple, well-contained class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
