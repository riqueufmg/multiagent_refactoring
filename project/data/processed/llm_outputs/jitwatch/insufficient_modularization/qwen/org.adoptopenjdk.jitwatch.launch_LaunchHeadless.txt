    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.launch.LaunchHeadless",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 30 weighted method count (wmc=30), which indicates moderate complexity. With 152 lines of code (loc=152) and 11 fields (nof=11), the class size is reasonable. The lack of inheritance (dit=2) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it is not overly complex. While it has dependencies on 12 other classes, this is not excessive given its functionality scope. The metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization."
