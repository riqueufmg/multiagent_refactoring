{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.source.ViewerSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), with a low weighted method count (wmc=5). The class directly uses only 4 dependencies and has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The size and complexity metrics indicate a small, focused class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
