      "detection": true,
      "justification": "The package contains only this single class (all 253 LOC), indicating a concentration of responsibilities. The class defines many methods (19) and exhibits high overall complexity (WMC=70), suggesting it implements multiple behaviors rather than a focused abstraction. It also depends on several distinct subsystems (model, util, core, assembly/architecture), implying it coordinates diverse concerns. Although LCOM is relatively low, the combination of size, high complexity, numerous methods, and cross-cutting dependencies supports that the class is inadequately decomposed and likely suffers from insufficient modularization."
