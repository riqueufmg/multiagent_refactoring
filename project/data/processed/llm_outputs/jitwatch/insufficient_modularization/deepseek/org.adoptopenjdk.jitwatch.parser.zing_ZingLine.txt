    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.zing.ZingLine",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high method count (nom=34, nopm=33) and moderate size (loc=147), indicating it may be handling multiple responsibilities. The lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0) suggests all methods operate on the same data, but the high method count and absence of child classes (nc=0) suggest insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
