    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 7 fields (nof=7) and only 2 methods (nom=2), resulting in high LCOM (1.0) indicating low cohesion. The class has 58 lines of code (loc=58) and 5 weighted methods per class (wmc=5), suggesting it could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity by grouping related fields and methods into separate classes."
