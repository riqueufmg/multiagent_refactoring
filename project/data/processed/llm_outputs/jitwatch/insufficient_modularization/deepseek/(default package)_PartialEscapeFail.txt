    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods, 30 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 4. These metrics indicate a small, simple class with low implementation complexity. No dependencies suggest no hidden responsibilities. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
