    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 7 fields (nof=7) with a moderate LCOM value (0.36), indicating potential grouping of unrelated responsibilities. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and absence of child classes (nc=0) suggest it is a leaf class that could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
