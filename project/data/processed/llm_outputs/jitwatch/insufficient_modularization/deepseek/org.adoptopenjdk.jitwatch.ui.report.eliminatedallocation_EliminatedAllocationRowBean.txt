    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=32, WMC=8, NOM=6) and no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0), indicating it is already small and focused. It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) beyond its declared types, suggesting it is not taking on multiple responsibilities."
