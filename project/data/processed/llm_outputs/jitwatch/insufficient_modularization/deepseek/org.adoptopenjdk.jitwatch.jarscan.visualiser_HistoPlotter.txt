    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.visualiser.HistoPlotter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 12 methods (nom=12) with 8 public methods (nopm=8) and 154 lines of code (loc=154), indicating significant implementation complexity. The lack of decomposition is evidenced by 8 fields (nof=8) and a lack of inheritance (dit=0) or delegation to other classes, suggesting multiple responsibilities are concentrated in a single class."
