    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencesearch.SequenceSearchOperation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with 5 public methods (nopm=5) and 116 lines of code (loc=116), indicating moderate size and complexity. The weighted methods per class (wmc=35) is relatively high, suggesting complex method implementations. The lack of cohesion metric (lcom=0.25) shows some cohesive grouping, but the combination of method count, code volume, and complexity metrics suggests further decomposition could reduce implementation complexity."
