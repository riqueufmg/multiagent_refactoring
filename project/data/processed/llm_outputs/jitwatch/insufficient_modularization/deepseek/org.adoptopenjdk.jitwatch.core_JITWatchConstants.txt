    "justification": "The class has 283 fields (nof=283) and only 2 methods (nom=2), resulting in a very high field-to-method ratio and low cohesion (lcom=1.0). This indicates a large collection of constants that could be grouped into smaller, more focused classes based on thematic categories to reduce size and complexity."
