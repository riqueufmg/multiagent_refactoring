{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.FileUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with a relatively high WMC (25) and LOC (132), indicating significant implementation complexity concentrated in a single class. The LCOM value (0.625) suggests moderate cohesion, meaning the methods may not be strongly related, which is a sign that the class could be decomposed into more focused, smaller modules."
