    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: only 2 methods (both public), 20 lines of code, 4 weighted methods per class, and 0 lack of cohesion. It extends a specialized parent class (MethodCountMap) and has minimal dependencies. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
