    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.LineTable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17) and 151 lines of code (loc=151), indicating significant size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=37) is high, suggesting complex methods. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.176) shows the methods are highly related, but the class depends on two other classes (LineTableEntry, MemberBytecode) that could potentially encapsulate some of its responsibilities, indicating insufficient decomposition."
