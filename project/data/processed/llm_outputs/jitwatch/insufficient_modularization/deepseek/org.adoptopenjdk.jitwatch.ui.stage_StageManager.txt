    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage.StageManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom) with only 12 being public (nopm), indicating a mix of responsibilities. A Weighted Method Complexity (wmc) of 31 and 137 lines of code (loc) suggest moderate implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposition. The low Lack of Cohesion of Methods (lcom) value of 0.13 suggests the methods are related, but the number of methods and complexity indicate the class may be handling multiple concerns within the UI stage management domain."
