    "justification": "High LOC (541) and WMC (119) indicate large size and complexity. High number of methods (nom=25) with many public methods (nopm=6) suggests multiple responsibilities. Low LCOM (0.12) indicates high cohesion, but the class is large and complex, suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
