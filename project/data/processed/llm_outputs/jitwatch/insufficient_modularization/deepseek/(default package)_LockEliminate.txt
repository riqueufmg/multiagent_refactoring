    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: only 4 methods (2 public), 22 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 5. It has no fields, no dependencies, and a lack of cohesion (LCOM = -1) suggests no internal state to decompose. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
