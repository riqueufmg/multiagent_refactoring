    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=32, WMC=7, NOM=4) and no fields (NOF=2, NOPF=0), indicating it is already small and simple. The LCOM value of 0.5 suggests moderate cohesion, but the minimal size and lack of internal complexity do not justify further decomposition."
