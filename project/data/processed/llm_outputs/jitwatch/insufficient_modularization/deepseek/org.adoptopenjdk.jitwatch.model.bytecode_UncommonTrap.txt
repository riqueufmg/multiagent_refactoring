    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=52, WMC=9, NOM=7) and no fields (NOF=4, NOPF=0), indicating it is already small and focused. LCOM=0.29 suggests good cohesion, and it has minimal dependencies (only one external class). No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
