    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox.Sandbox",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 11 methods (nom=11) and 52 weighted methods per class (wmc=52), indicating many responsibilities. It depends on 15 external types, suggesting it handles multiple concerns like compilation, runtime execution, logging, and UI interaction. With 258 lines of code (loc=258) and 13 fields (nof=13), it exhibits characteristics of a large, monolithic class that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused modules."
