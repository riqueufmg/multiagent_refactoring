    "justification": "The class has high method count (nom=19) and weighted method complexity (wmc=47) relative to its lines of code (loc=181), with low cohesion (lcom=0.0) and no inheritance (dit=0), indicating it likely handles multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
