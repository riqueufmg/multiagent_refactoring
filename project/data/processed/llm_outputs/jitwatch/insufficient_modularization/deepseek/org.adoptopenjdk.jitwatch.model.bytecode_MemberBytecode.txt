    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high WMC (30) and LOC (112) indicating significant complexity, low LCOM (0.14) suggests high cohesion, but the class manages multiple distinct dependencies (e.g., BytecodeInstruction, ExceptionTable, LineTable) and has 14 methods, suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes handling specific responsibilities."
