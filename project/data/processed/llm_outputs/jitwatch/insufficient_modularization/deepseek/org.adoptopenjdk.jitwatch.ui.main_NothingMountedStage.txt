    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.NothingMountedStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=44, WMC=3, NOM=3) and no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0), indicating it is already small and simple. It has zero incoming dependencies (fanin=0) and only four outgoing dependencies, suggesting it is already focused on a single responsibility. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
