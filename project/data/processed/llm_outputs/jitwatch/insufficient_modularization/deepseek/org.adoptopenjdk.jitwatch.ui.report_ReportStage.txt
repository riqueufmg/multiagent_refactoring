    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.ReportStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=19, LOC=86), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). It has a moderate number of methods (nom=5) and fields (nof=6), which does not indicate excessive responsibility. The dependencies are all related to UI report building, suggesting a focused single responsibility."
