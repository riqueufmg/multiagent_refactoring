    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods (nom) with 3 being public (nopm), 5 fields (nof), and a high WMC of 41 indicating significant complexity. The LOC of 170 suggests a large implementation. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and zero fan-in/fan-out indicate it operates in isolation, consolidating multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
