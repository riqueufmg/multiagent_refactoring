    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 1 field (nof=1), and 16 lines of code (loc=16), which are low counts. The weighted method complexity (wmc=4) is also low. These metrics indicate the class is already small and simple, showing no clear need for further decomposition to reduce size or complexity."
