{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.DisassemblyUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods (nom=6) with 100 lines of code (loc=100) and a weighted method complexity of 31 (wmc=31), indicating moderate size and complexity concentrated in a single class. The lack of cohesion metric (lcom=0.333) suggests some methods could be grouped separately, and the class has only one dependency, showing it operates in relative isolation and could potentially be decomposed further to reduce its responsibilities."
