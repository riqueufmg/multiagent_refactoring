    "class": "(default package).DoesItVectoriseValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 36 lines of code (loc=36), which are low values indicating small size and low complexity. All methods are public (nopm=6), suggesting a focused interface. The weighted method complexity (wmc=9) is low, and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) that would indicate mixing of concerns. The class appears sufficiently modularized for its current responsibilities."
