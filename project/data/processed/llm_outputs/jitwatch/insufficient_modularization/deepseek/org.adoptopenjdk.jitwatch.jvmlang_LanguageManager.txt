    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) and 123 lines of code (loc=123), indicating a moderate size and complexity. It depends on 16 external types, suggesting it manages multiple language compilers and runtimes, which could be decomposed into separate handlers or strategies to reduce its responsibilities and implementation complexity."
