    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.AbstractNMethodStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 fields (nof=16) and 11 methods (nom=11) with 105 lines of code (loc=105), indicating a large and potentially complex class. The low cohesion (lcom=0.18) suggests the fields and methods may not be tightly related, and the presence of 5 public methods (nopm=5) could indicate multiple responsibilities. The class depends on 6 external types, further suggesting it handles multiple concerns that could be separated."
