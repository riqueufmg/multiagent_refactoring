    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15) and 178 lines of code (loc=178), indicating significant size and complexity. A Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) of 41 suggests high method complexity. The presence of 8 fields (nof=8) and 0 local classes (nc=0) further indicates that multiple responsibilities may be combined within this single class, which could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
