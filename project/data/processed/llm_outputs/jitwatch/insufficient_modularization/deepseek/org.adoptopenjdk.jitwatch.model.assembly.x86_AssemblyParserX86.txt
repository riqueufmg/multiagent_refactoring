    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.x86.AssemblyParserX86",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 public methods (nom=7, nopm=7) and a high weighted method count (wmc=37) relative to its lines of code (loc=160), indicating significant implementation complexity concentrated in one class. The lack of cohesion metric (lcom=0.57) suggests multiple unrelated responsibilities, and the absence of child classes (nc=0) despite a depth of inheritance (dit=2) shows it inherits behavior but does not extend modularity."
