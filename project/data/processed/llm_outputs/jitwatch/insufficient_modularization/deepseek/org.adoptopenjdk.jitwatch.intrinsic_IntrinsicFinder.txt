    "justification": "The class has 3 methods (nom=3) with a high WMC (14) and LOC (89), indicating significant implementation complexity concentrated in a small number of methods. The LCOM value (0.667) suggests moderate cohesion, meaning the methods may not be strongly related, which could be improved by decomposition."
