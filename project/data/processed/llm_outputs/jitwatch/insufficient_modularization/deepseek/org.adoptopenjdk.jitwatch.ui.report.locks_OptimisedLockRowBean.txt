    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.locks.OptimisedLockRowBean",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (LOC=36, WMC=10, NOM=7) and no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0), indicating it is already a small, focused class. It has high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0) and inherits from a parent (DIT=2), suggesting it is well-decomposed. No evidence of insufficient modularization."
