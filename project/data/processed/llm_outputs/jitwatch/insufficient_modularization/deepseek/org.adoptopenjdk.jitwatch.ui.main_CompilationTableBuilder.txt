    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.CompilationTableBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: only 2 methods (nom=2), 33 lines of code (loc=33), and a weighted method count of 2 (wmc=2). It has no fields (nof=0) and minimal dependencies (fanout=0, fanin=0). These characteristics indicate the class is already small and simple, showing no need for further decomposition."
