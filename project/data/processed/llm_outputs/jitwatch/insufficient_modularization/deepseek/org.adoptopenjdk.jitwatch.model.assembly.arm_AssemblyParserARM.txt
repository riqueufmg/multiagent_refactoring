    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom) and 214 lines of code (loc), indicating a significant size and potential complexity. The weighted method count (wmc) of 56 is high, suggesting complex methods. The lack of cohesion (lcom) value of 0.44 indicates some grouping of unrelated responsibilities, which could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
