    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=44, WMC=11, NOM=2) and minimal dependencies. It contains only two public methods and one field, indicating it is already focused on a single responsibility related to OS operations. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
