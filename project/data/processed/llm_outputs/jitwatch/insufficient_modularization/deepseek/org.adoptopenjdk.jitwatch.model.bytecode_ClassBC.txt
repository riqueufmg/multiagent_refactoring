    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.ClassBC",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 23 methods (nom=23) and 134 lines of code (loc=134), indicating substantial implementation complexity. A lack of cohesion (lcom=0.304) suggests multiple responsibilities, and the presence of 10 fields (nof=10) further supports that the class could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
