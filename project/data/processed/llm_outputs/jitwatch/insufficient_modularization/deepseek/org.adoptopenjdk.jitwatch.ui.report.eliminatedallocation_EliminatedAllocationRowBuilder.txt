    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=69, WMC=8, NOM=8) with no fields (NOF=0) and no dependencies. It shows high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0) and all methods are public (NOPM=7 out of NOM=8), indicating it is already a focused, single-responsibility utility class with no clear opportunity for further decomposition."
