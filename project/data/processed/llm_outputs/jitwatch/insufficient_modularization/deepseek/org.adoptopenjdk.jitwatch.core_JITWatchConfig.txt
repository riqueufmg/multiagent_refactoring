    "justification": "The class has high metrics indicating excessive responsibility: 59 fields (nof), 86 methods (nom), 568 lines of code (loc), and 142 weighted methods per class (wmc). These values suggest the class is large and complex, performing many functions that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
