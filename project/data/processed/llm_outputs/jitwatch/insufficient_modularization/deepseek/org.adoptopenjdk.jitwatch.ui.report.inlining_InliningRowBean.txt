    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=29, WMC=8, NOM=6) and no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0), indicating it is already small and simple. All methods are public (NOPM=6), suggesting it serves as a simple data or behavior container without internal complexity requiring decomposition."
