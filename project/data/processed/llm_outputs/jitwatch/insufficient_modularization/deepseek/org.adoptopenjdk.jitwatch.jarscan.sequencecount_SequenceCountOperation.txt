    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) with 34 weighted methods per class (wmc=34) and 105 lines of code (loc=105), indicating moderate size and complexity. The low cohesion (lcom=0.2) suggests the methods may be performing distinct responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
