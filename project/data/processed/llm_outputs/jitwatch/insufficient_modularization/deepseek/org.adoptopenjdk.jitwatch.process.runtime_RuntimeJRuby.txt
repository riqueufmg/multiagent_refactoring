    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeJRuby",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=32, WMC=7, NOM=4) and no fields (NOF=2, NOPF=0), indicating it is already small and simple. LCOM=0.5 suggests moderate cohesion, and it has minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
