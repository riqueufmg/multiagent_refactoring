    "justification": "Class has only 6 methods with 46 LOC and WMC of 9, indicating small size and low complexity. No fields suggest it is a utility class. LCOM of -1 indicates no instance variables to group methods around, which is appropriate for a stateless class. No dependencies suggest it is already focused on a single responsibility."
