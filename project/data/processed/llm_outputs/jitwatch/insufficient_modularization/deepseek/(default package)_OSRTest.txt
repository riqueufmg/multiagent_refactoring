    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 22 lines of code (loc=22), and a weighted method complexity of 6 (wmc=6). These metrics indicate a small, simple class with low implementation complexity. No dependencies suggest it is already focused. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
