    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 fields (nof=15) and 12 methods (nom=12) with 154 lines of code (loc=154), indicating a large and potentially complex single class. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low cohesion (lcom=0.0) suggest it may be handling multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
