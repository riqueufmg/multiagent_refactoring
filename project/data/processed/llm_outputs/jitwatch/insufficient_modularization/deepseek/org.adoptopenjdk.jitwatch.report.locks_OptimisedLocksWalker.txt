    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: LOC=8, WMC=2, NOM=2, NOF=0. It has no fields and only two methods, indicating it is already small and simple. The LCOM value is -1.0, which suggests no cohesion issues. There is no evidence of high implementation complexity or large size that would warrant further decomposition."
