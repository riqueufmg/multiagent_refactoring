    "justification": "Class has low complexity (WMC=18, LOC=51), low number of fields (NOF=4), and moderate number of methods (NOM=7). All methods are public (NOPM=7), suggesting a focused interface. LCOM=0 indicates good cohesion. No evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity requiring further decomposition."
