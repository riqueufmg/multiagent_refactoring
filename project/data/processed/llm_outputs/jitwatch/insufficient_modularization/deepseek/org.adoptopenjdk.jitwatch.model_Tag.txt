    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Tag",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom=21) and 177 lines of code (loc=177), indicating significant size and potential complexity. While LCOM (0.095) suggests good cohesion, the high method count and moderate WMC (46) suggest the class could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
