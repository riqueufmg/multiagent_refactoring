    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.JVMSUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with 6 being public (nopm=6) and only 4 fields (nof=4), indicating a high method-to-field ratio. The low LCOM value (0.25) suggests strong method cohesion, but the class size (loc=97) and complexity (wmc=19) combined with multiple external dependencies suggest it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce implementation complexity."
