    "justification": "The class has moderate size (165 LOC, 26 methods) and low complexity (WMC 43, LCOM 0.115). It has 9 fields and 25 public methods, indicating focused responsibility. Dependencies are limited to core model and loader types, suggesting cohesion. No extreme metric values or clear decomposition opportunities are evident from the isolated data."
