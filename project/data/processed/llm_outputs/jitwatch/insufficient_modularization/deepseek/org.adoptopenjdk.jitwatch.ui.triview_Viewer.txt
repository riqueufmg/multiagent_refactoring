    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High method count (nom=42), high lines of code (loc=386), and high weighted method count (wmc=92) indicate excessive implementation complexity and size. The class has 24 fields (nof) and 9 public fields (nopf), suggesting multiple responsibilities. Low cohesion (lcom=0.0) may indicate unrelated methods grouped together, supporting insufficient decomposition."
