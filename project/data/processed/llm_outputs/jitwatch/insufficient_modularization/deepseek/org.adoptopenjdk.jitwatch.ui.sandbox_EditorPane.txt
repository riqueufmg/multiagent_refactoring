    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.EditorPane",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics (WMC=36, LOC=184, NOM=19) and handles multiple responsibilities including UI components, event handling, and business logic for a sandbox editor, suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
