    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.ClassTree",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) and 192 lines of code (loc=192), indicating substantial size and complexity. A Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) of 48 suggests high method complexity. The lack of child classes (nc=0) and dependencies on only four external classes suggest the class handles multiple responsibilities internally rather than delegating to specialized components."
