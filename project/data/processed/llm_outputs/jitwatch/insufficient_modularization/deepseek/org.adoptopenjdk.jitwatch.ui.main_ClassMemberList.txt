    "justification": "The class has 27 methods (nom) with a high WMC of 45, indicating significant complexity. It also has 222 lines of code (loc) and a low LCOM value of 0.11, suggesting high cohesion, but the large method count and complexity suggest it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
