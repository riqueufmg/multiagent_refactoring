    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=28, WMC=10, NOM=4) and no dependencies, indicating it is already a small, focused module. The LCOM value of 0.75 suggests moderate cohesion, but the overall size and responsibility are minimal, making further decomposition unnecessary."
