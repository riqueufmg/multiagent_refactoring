{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.parserchooser.ParserChooser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=4, LOC=23, NOM=4) and no indication of multiple responsibilities. It has only 2 fields and 4 methods, all public, suggesting it is already a focused, single-purpose class. The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates moderate cohesion, not low enough to suggest insufficient modularization."
