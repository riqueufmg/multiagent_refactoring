    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.Dialogs",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15) with only 2 fields (nof=2), indicating it is primarily a collection of static utility methods. The high method count relative to fields, combined with low cohesion (lcom=0.267) and the presence of inner classes (Response, Dialog) suggests it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
