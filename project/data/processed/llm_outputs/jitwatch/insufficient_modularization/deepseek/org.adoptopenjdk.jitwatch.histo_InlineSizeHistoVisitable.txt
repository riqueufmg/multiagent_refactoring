    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=17, LOC=94, NOM=5) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=0.4 indicates good cohesion. The number of methods is small, and there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or high implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
