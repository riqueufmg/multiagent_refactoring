    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain.CompileNode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom) with 111 lines of code (loc) and a weighted method complexity of 28 (wmc), indicating significant implementation complexity. The lack of decomposition is further evidenced by 9 fields (nof) and a non-zero LCOM value (0.158), suggesting multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
