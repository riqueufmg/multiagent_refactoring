    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=13, LOC=48), minimal fields (NOF=2), and cohesive methods (LCOM=0.0). It shows no signs of insufficient decomposition as it is small, focused, and has no internal complexity suggesting further modularization is needed."
