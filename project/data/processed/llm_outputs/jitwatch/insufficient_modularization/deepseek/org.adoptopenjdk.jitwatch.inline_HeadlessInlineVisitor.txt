    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.inline.HeadlessInlineVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 10 fields (nof=10) and 4 methods (nom=4) with a total of 144 lines of code (loc=144). The high number of fields relative to methods and the moderate size suggest insufficient decomposition. The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates moderate cohesion, which could be improved through further modularization."
