{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.ResourceLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods (nom=7) and 107 lines of code (loc=107), indicating a moderate size and complexity concentrated in a single class. While its LCOM value (0.29) suggests low cohesion, the presence of 6 public methods (nopm=6) and a single field (nof=1) suggests the class may be handling multiple responsibilities related to resource loading that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or helper methods to reduce implementation complexity."
