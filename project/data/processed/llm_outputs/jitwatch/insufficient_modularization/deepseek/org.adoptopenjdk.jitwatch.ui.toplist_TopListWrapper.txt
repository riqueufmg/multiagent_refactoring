    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.toplist.TopListWrapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: only 4 methods (nom=4), 19 lines of code (loc=19), and a weighted method complexity of 4 (wmc=4). It has zero cohesion issues (lcom=0.0) and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These values indicate the class is already small and simple, showing no need for further decomposition."
