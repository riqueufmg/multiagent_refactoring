    "justification": "The class has 4 fields (nof=4) and 32 lines of code (loc=32) but contains no methods (nom=0, nopm=0). This indicates it is a data-only class that could be decomposed into a more modular structure, such as a record or a class with encapsulated behavior, to reduce its size and complexity."
