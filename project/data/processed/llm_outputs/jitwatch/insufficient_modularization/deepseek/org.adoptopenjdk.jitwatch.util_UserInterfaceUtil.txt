    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) with 11 public methods (nopm=11), 144 lines of code (loc=144), and a weighted method complexity of 29 (wmc=29). This indicates a large, potentially complex class that could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
