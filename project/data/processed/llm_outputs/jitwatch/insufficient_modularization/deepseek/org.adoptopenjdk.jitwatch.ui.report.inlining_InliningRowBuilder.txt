    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=8, LOC=69) with a small number of methods (NOM=8, NOPM=7). It has no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0) and no dependencies, indicating it is already a focused, single-responsibility utility class. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
