    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods but a high LCOM value of 1.0, indicating low cohesion. It has 0 fan-in and 0 fan-out, suggesting it is a utility class that could be decomposed into more specialized components. The WMC of 12 and LOC of 36 are moderate, but the lack of cohesion and utility nature suggest insufficient modularization."
