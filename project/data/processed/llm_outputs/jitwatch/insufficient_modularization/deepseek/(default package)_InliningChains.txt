{
    "class": "(default package).InliningChains",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 10 methods (nom=10) with only 2 being public (nopm=2), indicating many private/internal methods that could be extracted. The LOC (88) and WMC (11) suggest moderate size and complexity, but the high method count relative to LOC suggests each method is small, potentially indicating utility methods that could be grouped into separate helper classes. The LCOM value (-1.0) suggests no shared instance variables, which may indicate the class is handling multiple unrelated responsibilities."
