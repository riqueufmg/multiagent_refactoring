    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high method count (nom=43) and weighted method complexity (wmc=43), indicating it may be handling multiple responsibilities. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it is self-contained and could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
