    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=9, LOC=33), minimal fields (NOF=1), and moderate methods (NOM=6). All methods are public (NOPM=6), indicating a focused interface. LCOM=0 suggests good cohesion. The single dependency is a related data class. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
