    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread.CompilerThreadStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High LOC (467) and WMC (77) indicate large size and complexity. High number of methods (28) and fields (17) suggest multiple responsibilities. Low LCOM (0.107) suggests high cohesion, but the class contains inner classes (PlotMode, QueueCounter) that could be extracted, and the high method count with significant dependencies suggests insufficient decomposition."
