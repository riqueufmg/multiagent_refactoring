    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is an interface with 12 methods (nom=12) and 14 lines of code (loc=14). It has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no concrete methods (nopm=0). The low LOC and WMC (12) indicate minimal implementation complexity, and the interface appropriately groups related method signatures without excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
