    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.instructioncount.InstructionCountOperation",

    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=9, LOC=48), a small number of methods (NOM=5), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The LCOM value (0.4) indicates moderate cohesion, and the class is already focused on a single responsibility with only two fields (NOF=2). Further decomposition is not justified."
