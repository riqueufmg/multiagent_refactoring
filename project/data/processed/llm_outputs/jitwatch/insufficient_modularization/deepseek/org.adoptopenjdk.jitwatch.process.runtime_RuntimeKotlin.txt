    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=35, WMC=7, NOM=4) and no fields (NOF=3, NOPF=0), indicating it is already small and simple. LCOM=0.5 suggests moderate cohesion, and it has minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
