    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: LOC=11, WMC=3, NOM=3, and LCOM=0.67 indicates moderate cohesion. It has no fields (NOF=1 is likely a constant), minimal methods, and no dependencies indicating excessive responsibilities. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
