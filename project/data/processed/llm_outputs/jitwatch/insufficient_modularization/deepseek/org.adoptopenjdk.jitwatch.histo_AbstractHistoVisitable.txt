    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo.AbstractHistoVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=18, WMC=4, NC=4, NOM=4) and no fields (NOF=3 but NOPF=0 indicates no private fields). The LCOM of 0.75 suggests some cohesion issues, but the small size and lack of implementation complexity indicate further decomposition is not warranted."
