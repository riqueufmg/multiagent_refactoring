    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (475) and WMC (85) are high, and it has a large number of methods (37 total, 9 public). This indicates the class is large and complex, suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
