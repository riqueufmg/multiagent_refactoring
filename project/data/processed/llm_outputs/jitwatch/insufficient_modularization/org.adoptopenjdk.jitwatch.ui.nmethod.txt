      "justification": "Relatively large implementation (154 LOC) with many methods (12) and a high WMC (15). The class directly depends on both model types (IMetaMember, Compilation) and UI concerns (IPrevNextCompilationListener, StringUtil), indicating mixed responsibilities (representation/logic + UI interaction). It has no subclasses (nc=0, dit=0), concentrating functionality rather than delegating or decomposing it, which suggests insufficient modularization."

      "class": "AbstractNMethodStage",
      "detection": false,
      "justification": "Smaller (105 LOC) and structured as an abstract stage with 2 subclasses (nc=2, dit=1), indicating intended decomposition via inheritance. Cohesion is reasonable (LCOM≈0.18) and its dependencies (UI utilities, NMethodInfo, resize listener, JITWatchUI) match a stage/controller role. Although complexity (WMC=15) is non-trivial, the abstraction and clear separation of UI-stage responsibilities suggest adequate modularization."
