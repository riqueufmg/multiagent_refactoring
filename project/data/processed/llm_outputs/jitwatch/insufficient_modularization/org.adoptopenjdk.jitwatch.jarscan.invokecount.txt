All methods are public (nopm 3) which hints at a broader interface than necessary for its size, indicating responsibilities that could be split into smaller, more cohesive classes."

The combination of bytecode parsing, counting and mapping behaviors concentrated in one class suggests it is doing multiple duties and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, focused classes."
