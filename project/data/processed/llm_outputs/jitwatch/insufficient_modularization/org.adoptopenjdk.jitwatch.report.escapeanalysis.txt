      "justification": "Class is small (65 LOC) with a modest number of methods (nom=6) and only one field, indicating limited size. Cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.5). Although complexity (wmc=14) is non‑trivial, the class appears to be an abstractional walker that naturally depends on several model/report types; those dependencies are expected for its role rather than evidence of a bloated, multifaceted responsibility. DIT=3 shows it participates in an inheritance hierarchy but does not by itself indicate an undecomposed, monolithic abstraction."
