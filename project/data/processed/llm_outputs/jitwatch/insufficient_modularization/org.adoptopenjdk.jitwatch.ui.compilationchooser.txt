      "justification": "Class is small (LOC 48) with a modest number of methods (6) and moderate cyclomatic/weight (WMC 11). Cohesion is high (LCOM 0.0), there are no subclasses (NC 0) and it has minimal coupling indicators (fanin 0, fanout 0 in the provided data, and only three explicit type dependencies). Package contains a single class, and the class does not exhibit a bloated interface or concentrated, disparate responsibilities—metrics indicate a focused, cohesive abstraction rather than insufficient modularization."
