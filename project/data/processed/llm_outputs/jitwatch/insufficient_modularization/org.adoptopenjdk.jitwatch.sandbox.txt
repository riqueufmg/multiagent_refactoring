      "justification": "Class is the only type in its package (package has 1 class) suggesting the package-level abstraction was not decomposed. It is large (loc 258) with many fields (nof 13) and methods (nom 11) and a high complexity score (wmc 52), indicating concentrated complexity. The class depends on a wide range of subsystems (model, process, parser, UI.sandbox, util, jvmlang, compiler, runtime, logger, config, etc.), implying it coordinates multiple responsibilities (process/control, parsing, UI integration, file/config handling, disassembly/analysis). Together these facts indicate the class bundles multiple concerns and would benefit from being split into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
