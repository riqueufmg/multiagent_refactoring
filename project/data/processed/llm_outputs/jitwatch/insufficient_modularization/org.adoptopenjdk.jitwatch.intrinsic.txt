      "detection": true,
      "justification": "Package contains a single class, suggesting limited decomposition at the package level. The class has moderate size (LOC=89) and elevated complexity (WMC=14) while exposing few methods (nom=3), indicating concentrated functionality. LCOM=0.666 signals low cohesion (multiple responsibilities or unrelated functionality in the same class). Together these factors (single-class package, moderate size/complexity, and reduced cohesion) justify that IntrinsicFinder is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
