It depends on many distinct subsystems (UI main, model, compile chain walker, compilation chooser, resize listener, util classes), suggesting it coordinates UI, model access, chain traversal, resizing and selection logic. Concentration of most package functionality in one class and wide-ranging dependencies indicate inadequate decomposition and a bloated abstraction that should be split into smaller, more focused classes."
