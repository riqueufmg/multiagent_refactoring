Broad responsibilities implied by many external dependencies (parser, model, report comparator, tree visitor, suggestion walker, inline visitor, util classes) suggesting the class orchestrates parsing, reporting, tree visiting and inline analysis. Moderate cohesion (LCOM 0.4) with many public methods (nopm 8) signals a bloated interface and multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, cohesive classes."
