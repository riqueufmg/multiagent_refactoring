      "justification": "Class has a large implementation surface and complexity for a single class: 39 methods, 331 LOC and WMC=66 indicate substantial size and cognitive load. The package contains only this single class (no other classes to which responsibilities could be delegated) and fan-in/fan-out are 0, suggesting the behavior is concentrated here rather than distributed. Although LCOM is low (high cohesion) and there is only one field, the high method count and complexity imply multiple behaviors/responsibilities are bundled into one class rather than decomposed into smaller abstractions, consistent with insufficient modularization."
