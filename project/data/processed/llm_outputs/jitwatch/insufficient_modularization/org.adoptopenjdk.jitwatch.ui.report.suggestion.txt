No reported fan-in/fan-out and package has only two classes, so responsibilities appear limited rather than concentrated. Metrics do not indicate a bloated interface or excessive size that would suggest insufficient modularization."

      "justification": "Very small data-holder style class (LOC 17) with only 3 methods; although WMC is 8, the overall size and method count are low and the class likely encapsulates a focused responsibility (a bean). It has minimal dependencies and does not present signs of being an over-large, multi-responsibility abstraction requiring further decomposition."
