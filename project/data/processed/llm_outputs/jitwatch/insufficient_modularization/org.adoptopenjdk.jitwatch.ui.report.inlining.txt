Although it has some external dependencies (Report, Compilation, ReportType) and a nonzero inheritance depth (dit=2), its size and method count do not indicate a bloated or overly complex abstraction; metrics do not show poor cohesion or excessive responsibilities, so insufficient modularization is not supported by the available data."
