    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (LOC=331) with many methods (NOM=39) and high complexity (WMC=66). Only a small number of public methods (NOPM=4) combined with many internal methods suggests multiple responsibilities are implemented inside the same class. Zero fanin/fanout indicates those responsibilities are implemented internally rather than delegated. Although LCOM is low (0.051), the overall size and complexity metrics (LOC, NOM, WMC) justify further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
