    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and self-contained: LOC=33, NOM=5, NOF=2 and NOPM=4 indicate limited size and public surface. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no public fields (NOPF=0). Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.4). Although WMC=10 shows some method complexity, the overall low size and lack of external dependencies do not provide evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed; therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
