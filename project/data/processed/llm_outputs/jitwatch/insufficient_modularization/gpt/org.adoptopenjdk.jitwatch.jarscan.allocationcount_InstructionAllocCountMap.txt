    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=20, NOM=2, NOF=1, WMC=4 and LCOM=0.0. Low size and low complexity (few methods, single field) indicate it has a narrow responsibility and does not require further decomposition. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 and only two dependencies show limited coupling, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
