    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive. Metrics show loc=22, nom=2, nopm=2 (few methods), wmc=6 (low to moderate complexity), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion), and fanin=0, fanout=0 (no coupling). Given its small size, low method count, and high cohesion, further decomposition is not warranted."
