    "justification": "The class is trivial and contains no decomposition candidates: LOC=1, number of methods=0, number of fields=0, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0, and no dependencies. There is no size or internal complexity to justify further modularization, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
