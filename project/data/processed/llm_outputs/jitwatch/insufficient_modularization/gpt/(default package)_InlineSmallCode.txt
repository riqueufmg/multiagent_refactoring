    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted. Metrics: LOC=35 (small size), NOM=4 and NOPM=2 (few methods/public API), WMC=5 (low implementation complexity), LCOM=1.0 (no indication of multiple unrelated responsibilities), NOF=2 and NOPF=0 (few fields, no public fields), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 and no dependencies (low coupling). Taken in isolation these values indicate the class is already sufficiently modular."
