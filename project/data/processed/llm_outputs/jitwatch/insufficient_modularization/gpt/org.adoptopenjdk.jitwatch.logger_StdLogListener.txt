    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=8, NOM=2, WMC=2. Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Depth of inheritance is shallow (DIT=1). Given the low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
