    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.zing.ZingLine",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high number of methods (nom = 34, nopm = 33) and a high weighted method count (wmc = 34) indicate substantial implementation complexity concentrated in one class. Size metrics (loc = 147) and a relatively large number of fields (nof = 14) further support that the class is large and stateful. Although LCOM = 0.0 suggests methods are cohesive, the combination of many methods, high complexity, and a large public surface area imply the class could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity. Relevant metrics and dependencies: nom=34, nopm=33, wmc=34, loc=147, nof=14, dependencies=[org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.zing.ZingLineType, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MemberSignatureParts, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.LogParseException, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Task, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Tag]."
