    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=44 and 8 methods (nom=8) indicate limited size; LCOM=0.25 shows good cohesion so responsibilities are focused. Complexity is moderate (WMC=9) but not excessive for 8 methods. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single external dependency). No inheritance depth (DIT=0) or children (NC=0) that would suggest missed decomposition. Overall metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
