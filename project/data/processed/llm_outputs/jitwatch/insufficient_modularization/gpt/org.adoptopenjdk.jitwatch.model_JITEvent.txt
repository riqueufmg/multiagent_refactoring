    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITEvent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class size and complexity are low: LOC=26, WMC=5, NOM=5. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and there are few fields (NOF=3, NOPF=0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating limited coupling/responsibility. Given the small number of methods, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
