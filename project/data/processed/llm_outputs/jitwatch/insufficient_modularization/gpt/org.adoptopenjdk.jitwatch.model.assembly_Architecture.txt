    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=19, NOM=1, LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). Coupling is minimal: fanin=0, fanout=0. Complexity is not large in context of class size (WMC=8 for a single method). No inheritance depth or children (DIT=0, NC=0). These metrics indicate the class is not a candidate for further decomposition — no evidence of insufficient modularization."
