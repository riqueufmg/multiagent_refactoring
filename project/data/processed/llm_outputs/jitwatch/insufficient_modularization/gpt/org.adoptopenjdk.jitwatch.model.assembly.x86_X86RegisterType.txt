    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=38, NOF=4, NOM=4. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Fanout=0 and dependencies=[] indicate low coupling. Although WMC=11 is moderately high for the number of methods, the overall size (LOC) and method count are low, so there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
