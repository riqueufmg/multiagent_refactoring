    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=21), only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2), low complexity (wmc=4), single field (nof=1) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, 1 dependency). Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion, the class is small and simple; there is no evidence here that it should be further decomposed."
