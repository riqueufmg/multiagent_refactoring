    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.CompilationUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class is large and complex in isolation: LOC = 224 and WMC = 54 indicate high implementation size and cyclomatic complexity; NOM = 12 with NOPM = 10 (most methods are public) shows many responsibilities/exposed behaviors; LCOM = 0.333 (moderate/low cohesion) suggests the methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility; only 2 fields but many methods implies procedural-style behavior collected in one class; dependencies span multiple model and utility types (IMetaMember, ICompilationVisitable, StringUtil, ParseUtil, LogParseException, Task, Tag, IParseDictionary, Compilation) which suggests the class handles varied concerns. Together these metrics justify that the class is insufficiently modular and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, more cohesive classes or helper components."
