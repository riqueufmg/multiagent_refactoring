    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.CompilationTableRow",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High complexity and method count indicate insufficient modularization: WMC = 20 (relatively high complexity), NOM = 10 with NOPM = 9 (many methods, most public) and LOC = 71 (moderate size) concentrated in a single class. NOF = 1 (very little state) implies the class is behavior-heavy rather than stateful, and the class depends on multiple concerns (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Task, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.CompilationUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil), suggesting it handles multiple roles. LCOM = 0.2 (reasonable cohesion) does not offset the high complexity and large public surface. These elements together justify that the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
