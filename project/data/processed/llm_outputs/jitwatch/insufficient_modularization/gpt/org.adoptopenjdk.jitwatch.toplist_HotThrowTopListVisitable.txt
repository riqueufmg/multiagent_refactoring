    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, methods=3, fields=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Complexity is modest (WMC=7) and coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0) despite three declared dependencies. No evidence of a large size or multiple unrelated responsibilities that would indicate it should be further decomposed."
