    "justification": "WMC=10 with LOC=28 shows relatively high implementation complexity concentrated in a small class; NOM=4 (NOPM=3) combined with LCOM=0.75 indicates low cohesion among the few methods (methods likely cover multiple responsibilities); FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 imply the class is isolated so splitting it would not increase coupling. These factors together justify detection of Insufficient Modularization — the class should be considered for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
