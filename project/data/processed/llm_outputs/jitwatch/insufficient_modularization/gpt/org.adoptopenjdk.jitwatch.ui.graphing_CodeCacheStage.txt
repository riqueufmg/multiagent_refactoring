    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing.CodeCacheStage",

    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class. The class has a small number of methods (nom=5) and fields (nof=1), a moderate size (loc=106) and moderate complexity (wmc=18) but not extreme. Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.4) and coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Depth of inheritance is shallow (dit=2) and the listed dependencies are few. There is no strong evidence of multiple responsibilities or a large, monolithic implementation that would require decomposition."
