    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=19), very few methods (nom=2), low complexity (WMC=3), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These factors suggest the class is already small/cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
