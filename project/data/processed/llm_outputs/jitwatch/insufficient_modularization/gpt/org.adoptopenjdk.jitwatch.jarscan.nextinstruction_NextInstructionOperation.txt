    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction.NextInstructionOperation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=55) and few methods (nom=5, nopm=4) indicate limited internal surface area; moderate complexity (wmc=12) is not excessively high for decomposition; reasonable cohesion (lcom=0.4) suggests related responsibilities; small number of fields (nof=2) and no reported incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) reduce the need to split for dependency management. DIT=2 is low and dependencies list is small. Overall metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so further decomposition is not indicated."
