    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriViewPane",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: it is small (LOC=55) with a modest number of methods (NOM=8, public methods=7), moderate complexity (WMC=12) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are only a few dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is reasonably sized, focused, and not a candidate for further decomposition in isolation."
