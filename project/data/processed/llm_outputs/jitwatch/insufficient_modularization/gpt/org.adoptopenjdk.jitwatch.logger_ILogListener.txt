    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=4, number of methods (nom)=2, weighted method count (wmc)=2. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. Metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
