    "justification": "Class metrics indicate small, well-contained code: LOC=13, NOM=3, NOPM=3, WMC=3, NC=2. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency: Viewer) and no inheritance (DIT=0). Although LCOM=0.666 suggests moderate cohesion, the very small size and low complexity do not justify further decomposition—insufficient modularization is not detected."
