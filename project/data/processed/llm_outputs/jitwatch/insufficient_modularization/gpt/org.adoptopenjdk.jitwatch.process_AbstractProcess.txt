    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: moderate size (LOC=95), moderate number of methods (NOM=9, public methods=6), and cohesion is good (LCOM=0.333). Complexity (WMC=19) is borderline but not excessive, inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1), and coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, only dependency org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener). These values suggest the class is reasonably cohesive and not overly large/complex to require further decomposition."
