    "justification": "Class has small size and low complexity: loc=13, nof=3 fields, nom=0 methods, wmc=0. No dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no public methods (nopm=0). There is no sign of a large, complex, or multifunctional class that would benefit from further decomposition; metrics indicate a trivial/small holder class rather than insufficiently modularized code."
