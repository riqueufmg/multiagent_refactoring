    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, simple class: LOC=18, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPM=0, DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There is only one external dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil). These values indicate low size, low complexity and low coupling with no evidence of a large, monolithic implementation that would benefit from further decomposition. LCOM value (-1.0) is not indicating cohesion problems in the provided data. Therefore there is no indication of Insufficient Modularization."
