    "justification": "Class is small and not a clear candidate for further decomposition: LOC=39 and NOM=3 indicate limited size and surface area. WMC=5 shows only moderate complexity (no evidence of very high complexity). LCOM=0.666 suggests some decrease in cohesion but is not extreme, and fanin=0/fanout=0 indicate no strong coupling that would motivate splitting. Given these metrics in isolation, there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
