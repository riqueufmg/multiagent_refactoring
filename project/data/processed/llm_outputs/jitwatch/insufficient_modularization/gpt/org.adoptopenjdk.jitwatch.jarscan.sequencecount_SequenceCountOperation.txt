    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation complexity and size indicate insufficient modularization: WMC = 34 (high cyclomatic complexity for a single class), LOC = 105 (non-trivial size), and NOM = 10 methods (many behaviors to manage). The class interacts with multiple domain types (dependencies: MemberBytecode, Opcode, InstructionSequence, BytecodeInstruction), suggesting several distinct responsibilities (sequence handling, opcode/bytecode processing, result aggregation) that could be split. Although LCOM = 0.2 suggests reasonable cohesion, the combination of high WMC, significant LOC, and multiple dependencies justifies refactoring into smaller, focused classes to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
