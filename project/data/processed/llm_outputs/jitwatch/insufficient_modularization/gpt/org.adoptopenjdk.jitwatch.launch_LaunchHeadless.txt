    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.launch.LaunchHeadless",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (LOC = 152) combined with high complexity (WMC = 30) and a non-trivial number of members (NOF = 11, NOM = 10). It depends on many distinct components (12 listed dependencies), indicating multiple responsibilities. Although LCOM = 0.4 suggests some cohesion, the high WMC and LOC indicate that the class likely contains multiple concerns or complex methods that could be split into smaller classes or collaborators to reduce size and complexity."
