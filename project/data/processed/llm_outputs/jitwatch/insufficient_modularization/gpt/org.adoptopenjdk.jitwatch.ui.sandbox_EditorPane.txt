    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.EditorPane",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although EditorPane has moderate size and complexity (LOC=184, NOM=19 methods, WMC=36, NOF=10) which can be indicators of a class that might be split, its low Lack of Cohesion metric (LCOM=0.0) indicates high cohesion among its methods. The high number of methods and complexity appear to be focused around a single cohesive responsibility rather than multiple unrelated responsibilities. Given the class-in-isolation constraint, the cohesion metric outweighs raw size/complexity metrics, so there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
