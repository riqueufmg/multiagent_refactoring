    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: loc=7, nom=2, wmc=2. It has no fields (nof=0), no children (nc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion problems. These metrics show no evidence that the class has not been decomposed; further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity."
