    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.IJITListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and cohesive: LOC=5, NOM=3 and WMC=3 indicate few methods and low complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one listed dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITEvent). Given the small size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
