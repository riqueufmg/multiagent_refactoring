    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: number of methods nom=1, lines of code loc=16, low complexity wmc=2. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric indicates a focused responsibility (lcom=-1.0). There is no sign of a large size, high complexity, or low cohesion that would justify further decomposition."
