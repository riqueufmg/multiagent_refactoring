    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=15, nom=3, wmc=3, nof=1. Coupling is minimal: fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on NextInstructionCount. Although LCOM=0.6667 indicates moderate cohesion concerns, the overall size and low complexity do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
