    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=28, NOM=3, WMC=6, LCOM=0.0. It has only 1 field (NOF=1), no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), and low public method count (NOPM=3). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
