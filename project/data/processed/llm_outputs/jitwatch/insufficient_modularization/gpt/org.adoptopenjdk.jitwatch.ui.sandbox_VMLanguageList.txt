    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC = 40, number of methods = 4 and number of fields = 3, cyclomatic complexity (WMC) = 8 is moderate, and LCOM = 0.0 indicates high cohesion. Depth of inheritance (DIT) = 1 and fanin/fanout = 0 show low coupling. There is no sign of excessive size or complexity that would indicate a need for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
