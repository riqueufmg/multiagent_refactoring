    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.IPrevNextCompilationListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: loc=4, nom=2, wmc=2. No incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. Metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or would benefit from additional modularization."
