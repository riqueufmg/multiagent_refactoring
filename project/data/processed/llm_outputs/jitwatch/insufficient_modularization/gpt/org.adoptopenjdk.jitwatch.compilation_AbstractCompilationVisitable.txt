    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.AbstractCompilationVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=8, number of methods (nom)=1, number of fields (nof)=1 and WMC=2 indicating low implementation complexity. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling appears minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=1 shows no deep inheritance. Given these metrics (very small size, single responsibility, low complexity and low coupling), there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
