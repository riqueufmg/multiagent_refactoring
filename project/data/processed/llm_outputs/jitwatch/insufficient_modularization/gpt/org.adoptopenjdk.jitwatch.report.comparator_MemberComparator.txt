    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=5, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, NOPM=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report). There is no evidence of high complexity or large size that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
