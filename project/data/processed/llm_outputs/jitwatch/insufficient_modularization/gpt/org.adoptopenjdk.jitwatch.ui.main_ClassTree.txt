    "justification": "Class has high size and complexity: 192 LOC, 16 methods (13 public), WMC = 48 and 9 fields. The large number of methods and a high weighted method count indicate the class likely implements multiple responsibilities and contains complex behavior that could be split. The wide public surface (13 public methods) further suggests potential for separating concerns into smaller classes or helpers to reduce size and implementation complexity. (Metrics cited: loc=192, nom=16, nopm=13, wmc=48, nof=9.)"
