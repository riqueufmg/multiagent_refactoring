    "justification": "The class is small and does not require further decomposition: LOC=32, NOM=4 and only 2 fields indicate limited size; WMC=7 shows modest complexity; LCOM=0.5 suggests acceptable cohesion; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate low coupling; DIT=2 is shallow. These metrics collectively do not support Insufficient Modularization."
