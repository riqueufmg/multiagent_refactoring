    "justification": "Class is minimal and shows no signs of insufficient modularization: loc=1, nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]. LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion data/applicable). With no methods, fields, or dependencies, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
