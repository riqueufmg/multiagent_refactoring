    "justification": "Not detected. The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=20, NOM=3 (NOPM=2), WMC=5. It has no fields (NOF=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and a cohesion indicator LCOM=-1.0. Given the low size, low complexity and low coupling, there is no evidence this class has insufficient modularization or would benefit from further decomposition."
