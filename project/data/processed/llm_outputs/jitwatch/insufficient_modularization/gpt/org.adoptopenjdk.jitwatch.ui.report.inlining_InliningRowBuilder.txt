    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is small (69), number of methods is moderate (nom = 8), cyclomatic/weight metric is modest (wmc = 8), and cohesion appears high (lcom = -1.0). There are no incoming/outgoing coupling indicators (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and no external dependencies. Given the class size, moderate complexity, and high cohesion, further decomposition is not clearly warranted in isolation."
