    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo.InlineSizeHistoVisitable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate insufficient modularization: relatively small method count (nom=5) but moderate size (loc=94) and high complexity (WMC=17) — suggesting large/complex method bodies that could be split. LCOM=0.4 indicates limited cohesion across members, supporting decomposition. DIT=3 adds inherited complexity that may hide responsibilities. The class also depends on multiple domain types (IMetaMember, CompilationUtil, LogParseException, Tag, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, IParseDictionary), suggesting it handles several concerns. Together these facts justify that further decomposition (smaller classes or extracted helpers) would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
