    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=12, NOM=5, WMC=5 indicate low size and complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. There are no fields (NOF=0), no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). Given these metrics, further decomposition is not warranted and the Insufficient Modularization smell is not detected."
