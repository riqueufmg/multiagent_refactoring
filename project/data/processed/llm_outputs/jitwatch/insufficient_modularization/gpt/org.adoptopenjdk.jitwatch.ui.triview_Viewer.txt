    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size and complexity (LOC=386, WMC=92), large API and implementation surface (NOM=42 total methods, NOPM=27 public methods), many fields (NOF=24, NOPF=9 public fields). These values indicate multiple responsibilities and high implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposing the class into smaller, focused classes/components. (LCOM=0.0 does not outweigh the high LOC/WMC/NOM and broad public surface.)"
