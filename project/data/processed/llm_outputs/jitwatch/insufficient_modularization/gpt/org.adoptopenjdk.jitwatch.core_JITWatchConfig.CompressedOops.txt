    "justification": "Class has extremely small size and no implementation to decompose: LOC=1, nof=0 (no fields), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), nc=0, dit=0. Coupling is zero (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal; there is no evidence it suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
