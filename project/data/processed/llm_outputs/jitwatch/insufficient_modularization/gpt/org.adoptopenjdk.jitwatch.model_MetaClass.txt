    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaClass",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of being too large and doing multiple things: high number of methods (nom = 26) with almost all public (nopm = 25) implies many responsibilities; high complexity (wmc = 43) indicates substantial implementation complexity that could be decomposed; moderate physical size (loc = 165) and a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 9) support that the class contains considerable code and state. Additional indicators: multiple external dependencies (IMetaMember, MemberSignatureParts, BytecodeLoader, MetaPackage, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, ClassBC) imply it interacts with varied concerns. dIT = 0 and nc = 0 show it is not decomposed via inheritance. Although LCOM = 0.115 suggests reasonable cohesion, the combination of many public methods and high complexity justifies that further decomposition (insufficient modularization) is likely beneficial."
