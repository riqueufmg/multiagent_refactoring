    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=13, NOM=2, WMC=3, NOF=1. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Low size and low complexity (few methods, low cyclomatic weight) do not suggest further decomposition. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 (only 2 external dependencies) show low coupling. Although DIT=3, depth alone does not indicate insufficient modularization in isolation."
