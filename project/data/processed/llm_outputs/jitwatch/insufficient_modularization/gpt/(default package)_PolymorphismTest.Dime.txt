    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=5, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPF=0, NC=0. Cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate internal cohesion problems. Coupling is minimal: fanin=0, fanout=0, and no listed dependencies. Given the minimal size, zero methods/fields, zero complexity and no coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
