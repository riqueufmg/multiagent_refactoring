    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=10, nom=8 (likely abstract/interface method signatures), nof=0 (no fields to split out), wmc=8 but as an interface/method-signature container this does not indicate implementation complexity, fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), lcom=-1.0 (not meaningful for an interface or indicates cohesion). Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
