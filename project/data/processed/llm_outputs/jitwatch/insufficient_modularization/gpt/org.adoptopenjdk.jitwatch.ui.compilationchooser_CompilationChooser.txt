    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser.CompilationChooser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=48), few methods (nom=6) and fields (nof=4); cohesion is high (lcom=0.0); complexity is modest (wmc=11) and there is no coupling pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is appropriately scoped and does not require further decomposition."
