    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has indicators that suggest insufficient modularization: number of methods (nom) = 11 and weighted method count (wmc) = 15 (relatively high complexity concentrated in one class), lines of code (loc) = 58 and fields (nof) = 5 (non-trivial size/state), and depth of inheritance (dit) = 1 (responsibility not delegated via inheritance). Although cohesion (lcom = 0.2727272727) is reasonably good, the combination of method count and complexity implies multiple responsibilities that could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
