    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undersized decomposition: LOC=49 (small class size), NOM=6 with NOPM=5 (moderate number of methods), WMC=6 (low implementation complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (suggests high cohesion). FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 show no coupling pressure to force splitting. Given small size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization for this class."
