    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.IStageAccessProxy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no sign of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=10), no fields (nof=0), and no implementation complexity (nom=8 likely method signatures in an interface, nopm=0). WMC=8 reflects simple method counts rather than complex implementation, LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion for an interface, and fanin=0/fanout=0 show no coupling that would suggest a need to split. Overall metrics indicate an already minimal/declarative construct, so further decomposition is not warranted."
