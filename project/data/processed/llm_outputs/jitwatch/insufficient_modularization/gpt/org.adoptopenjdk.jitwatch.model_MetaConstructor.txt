    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=23, NOM=2, WMC=4, LCOM=0.0. Low method count and low complexity indicate no need for further decomposition. Limited dependencies and coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, listed dependencies=3) and shallow inheritance (DIT=2) do not suggest a large, complex class that would benefit from modularization."
