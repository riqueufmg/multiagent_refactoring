        "Class is small (loc=19) with only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2), so there is little code to decompose.",
        "Low coupling: fanin=0 and fanout=0 and no listed dependencies, so splitting would not reduce coupling or improve modular boundaries.",
        "Cohesion appears acceptable (lcom=-1.0 indicates high cohesion), so the class' responsibilities are not clearly mixed.",
        "Although WMC=9 indicates some method complexity, the overall size and method count are low; complexity is concentrated but does not justify decomposition in isolation."
