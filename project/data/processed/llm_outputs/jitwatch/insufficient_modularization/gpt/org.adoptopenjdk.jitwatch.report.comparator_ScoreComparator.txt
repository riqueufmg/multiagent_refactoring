    "justification": "Class is very small and well-scoped: loc=5, nom=1 (single method), wmc=1 (low complexity). Cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its tiny size and single responsibility, there is no evidence it has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not present."
