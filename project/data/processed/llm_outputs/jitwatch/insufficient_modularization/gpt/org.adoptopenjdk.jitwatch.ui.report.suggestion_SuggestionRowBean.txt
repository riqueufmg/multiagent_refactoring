    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=17) and few methods (nom=3) mean the class is already small; LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate low coupling; although WMC=8 is moderately high for the small method count, it alone does not justify further decomposition given the overall small LOC and strong cohesion. DIT=2 shows inheritance depth but does not imply the class should be split."
