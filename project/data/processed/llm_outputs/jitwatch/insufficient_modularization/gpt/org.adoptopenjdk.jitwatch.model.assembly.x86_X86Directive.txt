    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=17, NOM=2, NOF=1, NOPM=1 and LCOM=0.0 indicate single responsibility and high cohesion. Low complexity and size: WMC=6 but applied to only two methods and 17 lines. Low coupling and isolation: FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, no dependencies. No inheritance/extension concerns: DIT=0, NC=0. These metrics do not support further decomposition; therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
