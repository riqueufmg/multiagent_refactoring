    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.j9.J9LogParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Insufficient modularization detected: the class has few methods (nom = 4) but high total complexity (wmc = 16) and a non-trivial size (loc = 70), indicating large/complex method bodies that could be decomposed. Low cohesion (lcom = 0.75) shows methods are not highly related, suggesting multiple responsibilities. Only one public method (nopm = 1) with several non-public helpers is a common sign that internal behavior could be split into smaller classes. The class also touches multiple concerns/types (dependencies include IJITListener, J9Line, NumberedLine, Tag, J9Util), reinforcing that further decomposition could reduce complexity and improve cohesion."
