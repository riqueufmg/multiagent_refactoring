    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity (loc=8, wmc=1, nom=1) with only 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=2) and high cohesion (lcom=0.0). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already simple and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted."
