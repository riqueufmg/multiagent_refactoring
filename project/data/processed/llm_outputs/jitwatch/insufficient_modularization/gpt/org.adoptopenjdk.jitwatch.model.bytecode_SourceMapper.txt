    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that is insufficiently modularized: LOC is moderate (70), number of methods is small (nom = 6), number of fields is small (nof = 2), and LCOM = 0.333 indicates reasonable cohesion. Although WMC = 17 shows some internal complexity, it is not backed by large size, high method count, or low cohesion that would suggest further decomposition. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, so there is no evidence of broad external coupling that decomposition would address."
