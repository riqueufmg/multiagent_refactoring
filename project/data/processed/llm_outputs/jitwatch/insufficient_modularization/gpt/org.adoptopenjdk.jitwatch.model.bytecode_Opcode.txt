    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=42, NOM=10, WMC=10 (average complexity ~1 per method), LCOM=0.5 (reasonable cohesion). Fields are few (NOF=4, no public fields), and coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0, dependencies=[]). Given its modest size, moderate complexity, and acceptable cohesion, there is no strong indication that the class needs further decomposition."
