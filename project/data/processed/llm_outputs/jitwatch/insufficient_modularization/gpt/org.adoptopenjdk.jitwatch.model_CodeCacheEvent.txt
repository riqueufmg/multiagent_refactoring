    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=45, NOM=10 with WMC=10 (moderate overall complexity). LCOM=0.3 indicates good cohesion. There is limited coupling: FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and only two listed dependencies. Although it has 7 fields (NOF=7), there are no public fields (NOPF=0). Taken in isolation, these metrics do not show a large, complex, or low-cohesion class that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
