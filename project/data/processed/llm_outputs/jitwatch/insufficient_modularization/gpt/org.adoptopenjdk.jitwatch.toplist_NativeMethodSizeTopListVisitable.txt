    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive. Evidence: low LOC (27) and very few methods (nom=2, nopm=2) indicate limited size; low complexity (WMC=4); high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0); no coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT=3 shows inheritance depth, there is no indication of high implementation complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition."
