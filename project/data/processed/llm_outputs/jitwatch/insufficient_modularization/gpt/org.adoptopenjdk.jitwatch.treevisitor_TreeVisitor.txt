    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor.TreeVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=23, NOM=3, NOPM=1, NOF=0, LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). Cyclomatic/size complexity is low-moderate (WMC=7) and there is no inheritance depth (DIT=0). Coupling appears minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) despite three listed dependencies. Given the low size, few methods, absence of fields, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or that it requires further decomposition."
