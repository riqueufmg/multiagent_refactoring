    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: the class is small (loc=36), has few methods (nom=3), low complexity (wmc=6), a single field (nof=1), no inheritance (dit=0) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=0.666 indicates only moderate cohesion concerns but, given the small size and minimal responsibility and only one dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode), further decomposition is not justified."
