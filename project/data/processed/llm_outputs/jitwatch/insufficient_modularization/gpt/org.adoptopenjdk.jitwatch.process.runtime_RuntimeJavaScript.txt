    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and unlikely to need further decomposition: LOC=32, nom=4, nof=2. Complexity is moderate (WMC=7) but not excessive for the class size. Although LCOM=0.75 indicates some cohesion concerns, the low number of methods/fields and small footprint do not justify class-level decomposition in isolation. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 show no coupling pressure to split. Therefore, insufficient modularization is not detected based on the provided metrics."
