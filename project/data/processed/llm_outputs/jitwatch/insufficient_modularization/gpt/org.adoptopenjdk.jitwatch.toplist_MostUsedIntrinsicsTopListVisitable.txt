    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive, so further decomposition is not indicated. Evidence: LOC = 26, number of methods (nom) = 3 (nopm = 3), single field (nof = 1), high cohesion (LCOM = 0.0). Complexity is modest (WMC = 7) and coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) with only a few external dependencies (IMetaMember, IntrinsicFinder, IReadOnlyJITDataModel). The size, cohesion, and low coupling argue against insufficient modularization."
