    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 154 (large size), WMC = 24 (high implementation complexity), NOM = 12 (many methods), NOF = 8 (many fields). While LCOM = 0.333 indicates moderate cohesion, the combination of high size and complexity (LOC, WMC, NOM, NOF) suggests the class could be further decomposed. Fan-in = 0 and Fan-out = 0 with a single dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil) indicate the class is relatively self-contained, strengthening the case for splitting internal responsibilities."
