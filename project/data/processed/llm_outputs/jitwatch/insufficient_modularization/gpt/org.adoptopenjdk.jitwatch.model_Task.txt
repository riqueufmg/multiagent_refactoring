    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Task",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=65 and NOM=7 (small size), NOF=2 (few fields), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion), DIT=1 (shallow hierarchy). Although WMC=13 shows some complexity, it is not accompanied by many methods or low cohesion that would suggest a need to split the class. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show no strong coupling pressures requiring decomposition. Overall the class is small, cohesive, and not excessively complex, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided data."
