    "class": "(default package).Sort",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=42, NOM=5, NOF=3 and WMC=10 indicate modest size and complexity. LCOM=0.4 does not show strong lack of cohesion, and DIT=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 indicate no hidden coupling that would force further decomposition. Given these metrics in isolation, there is insufficient evidence that Sort needs additional modularization."
