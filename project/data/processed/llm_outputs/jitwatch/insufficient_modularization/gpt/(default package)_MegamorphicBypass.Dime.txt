    "justification": "Metrics show no signs of under-modularization: loc=5 (very small), nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods to decompose), nopf=0 and nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). Given the class's minimal size and lack of functionality, there is insufficient evidence to report Insufficient Modularization."
