    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=29, NOM=4 (NOPM=4), WMC=5 indicating low complexity, LCOM=0.0 indicating high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on BytecodeInstruction). DIT=0 and modest field count (NOF=3). These metrics do not indicate an incomplete decomposition or a need for further modularization."
