    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 16 LOC, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There is no evidence of large size or high implementation complexity that would suggest further decomposition is needed; cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) and absence of dependencies also do not indicate an undecomposed, monolithic class."
