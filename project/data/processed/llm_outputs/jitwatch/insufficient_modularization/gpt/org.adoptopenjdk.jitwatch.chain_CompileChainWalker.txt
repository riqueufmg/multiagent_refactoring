    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is modest in size (LOC=117) with a small number of methods (nom=5, nopm=3). It shows high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), indicating related responsibilities are kept together. Although WMC=18 indicates some method complexity, this level of complexity with only five methods does not by itself justify further decomposition. There is no evidence of large numbers of fields or public methods (nof=4, nopf=0) or high coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) that would indicate an undivided, monolithic class. DIT=2 is shallow and acceptable. Overall the metrics do not support diagnosing Insufficient Modularization."
