    "justification": "Metrics indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=48 with NOM=4 and WMC=10 (relatively high complexity concentrated in few methods) suggests the class bundles multiple complex behaviors; LCOM=0.5 shows only moderate cohesion (methods do not form a highly cohesive unit) and NOF=3 (multiple fields) plus NOPM=3 (several public methods) indicates multiple responsibilities; DIT=2 increases conceptual complexity via inheritance. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 imply the class centralizes functionality rather than being decomposed or reused. Together these elements (LOC, WMC, LCOM, NOF, NOPM, DIT) justify that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
