    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only 2 methods and 3 fields with LOC=50 and WMC=5, indicating modest size and complexity. Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion, the overall small method count and low complexity do not strongly indicate a need for further decomposition. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, and there is no inheritance depth (DIT=0), so in isolation this class does not exhibit clear insufficient modularization."
