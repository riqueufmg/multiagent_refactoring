    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerGroovy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and well modularized: only 28 LOC, 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 2 fields, low overall complexity (WMC=5) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
