    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeAnnotationList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=45), modest number of methods (NOM=7) and fields (NOF=2), and high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Although WMC=13 shows some method complexity, it is not accompanied by low cohesion or large size that would suggest the class should be further decomposed. Low coupling (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) and a single dependency (LineAnnotation) support that the class is appropriately modular in isolation."
