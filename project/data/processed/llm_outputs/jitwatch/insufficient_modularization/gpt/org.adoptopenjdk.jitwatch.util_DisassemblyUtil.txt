    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.DisassemblyUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 100 (relatively large for a single utility class) and WMC = 31 (high overall cyclomatic/complexity), indicating substantial implementation complexity concentrated in this class. It has only 1 field but 6 methods (5 public), so complexity is method-level rather than data-driven, suggesting multiple responsibilities or complex method bodies that could be decomposed. LCOM = 0.333 shows only moderate cohesion (not strongly cohesive), supporting the case for further decomposition. Dependency count is minimal (only OSUtil), so the class likely groups multiple concerns internally; splitting into smaller, focused modules would reduce size and complexity."
