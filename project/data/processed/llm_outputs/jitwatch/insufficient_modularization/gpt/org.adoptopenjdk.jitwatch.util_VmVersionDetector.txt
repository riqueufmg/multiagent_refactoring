    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.VmVersionDetector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected: class has only 2 methods (nom=2) but a high weighted method complexity (wmc=11) and 53 lines of code (loc=53), indicating large/complex methods rather than many small ones. Cohesion is very low (lcom=1.0), meaning methods do not share state and likely implement separate responsibilities. The class has a single field (nof=1) yet performs multiple complex operations (high wmc with few methods) and depends on both StringUtil and Tag, suggesting mixed responsibilities; these factors point to insufficient modularization and an opportunity to split/decompose the class into smaller, more focused units."
