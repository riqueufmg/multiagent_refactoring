    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=19, WMC=2 (low complexity), NOM=2 (few methods), NOF=1 (single field). LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 indicate low coupling. Given its small size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
