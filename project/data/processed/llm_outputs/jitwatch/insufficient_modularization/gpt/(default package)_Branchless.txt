    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: nom=6 and loc=46 show a small class size; wmc=9 indicates only moderate complexity; lcom=-1.0 indicates high cohesion; fanin=0 and fanout=0 with no dependencies suggest low coupling. Given the modest number of methods, low LOC, moderate complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
