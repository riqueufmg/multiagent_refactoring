    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=13, WMC=3, NOM=2, NOF=1, NOPM=1 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size and low complexity. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show no coupling that would suggest hidden responsibilities. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
