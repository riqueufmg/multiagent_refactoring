    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (LOC = 276) combined with high overall complexity (WMC = 60) and many methods (NOM = 17, with 10 public methods) indicates multiple or complex responsibilities that could be split. It also depends on a large number of external types (21 distinct dependencies), suggesting mixed responsibilities (UI, parsing, annotation handling, reporting, model access). Shallow inheritance (DIT = 1) means decomposition has not been achieved via subclassing, and the high WMC implies heavy method-level complexity that decomposition could reduce. These factors together justify refactoring into smaller, focused classes/modules."
