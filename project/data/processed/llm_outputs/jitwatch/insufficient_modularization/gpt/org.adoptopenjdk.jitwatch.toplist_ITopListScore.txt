    "justification": "Metrics indicate the type is already small and simple: loc=4, nom=2, wmc=2. There are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low size, low complexity and minimal number of methods do not suggest a need for further decomposition; LCOM=-1.0 is not indicative of poor cohesion for this interface. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
