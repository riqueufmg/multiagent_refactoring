    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.filechooser.FileChooserList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is moderate (123), number of methods is small (nom=9, nopm=6), and the class shows high cohesion (lcom=0.0). Although WMC is 21, the overall size and public surface are limited and there is minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Together these suggest the class is reasonably modular and does not require further decomposition based on the provided data."
