    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.CompilationTableBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=33), very few methods (NOM=2, NOPM=1), low complexity (WMC=2), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), low coupling (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0), and no depth in inheritance (DIT=0). These metrics indicate the class is already small, cohesive, and simple, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided data."
