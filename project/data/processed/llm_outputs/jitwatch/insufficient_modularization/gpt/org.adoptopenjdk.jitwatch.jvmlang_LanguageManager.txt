    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics show a class that is large and complex enough to merit decomposition: LOC = 123, NOM (methods) = 8, WMC = 43 (high overall cyclomatic/implementation complexity; average ~5.4 per method). Cohesion is moderate (LCOM = 0.5) rather than high, indicating methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility. The class depends on many distinct language-specific compiler/runtime types (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeJava/RuntimeScala/RuntimeKotlin/RuntimeGroovy/RuntimeJRuby/RuntimeJavaScript, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerJava/CompilerScala/CompilerKotlin/CompilerGroovy/CompilerJRuby/CompilerJavaScript, and related interfaces IRuntime/ICompiler), plus config/logger types, which implies it handles multiple responsibilities across different languages. Given the size/complexity metrics together with the large set of language-specific dependencies, the class exhibits Insufficient Modularization and would benefit from further decomposition."
