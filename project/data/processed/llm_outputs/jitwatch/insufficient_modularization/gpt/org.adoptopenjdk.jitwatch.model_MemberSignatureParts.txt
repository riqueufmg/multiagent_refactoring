    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MemberSignatureParts",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modularized based on these indicators: very high size (loc = 462), very high complexity (wmc = 109), large number of methods (nom = 29) including many public methods (nopm = 21), and a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 11). These values indicate a single class bearing many responsibilities and implementation paths that could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity. Although LCOM = 0.0 suggests methods share state, the combination of high LOC, high WMC, and many methods supports refactoring into smaller, more focused classes or components."
