    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly.ViewerAssembly",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 249) combined with high implementation complexity (wmc = 57) and many methods (nom = 15) indicate a class doing substantial work that could be split. The dependency list shows mixing of multiple concerns (UI and parsing/architecture details) — e.g. UI-related types (IStageAccessProxy, ILineListener, AssemblyLabel) alongside parsing/model and architecture-specific types (IAssemblyParser, AssemblyMethod, AssemblyInstruction, AssemblyUtil, Architecture, ARMShifter, ARMExtend, ARMRegisterType, MnemonicEntry, X86RegisterType). The presence of architecture-specific classes together with UI listeners and parser/model classes suggests multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, focused modules (e.g., a renderer/viewer, a parser/assembler handler, and architecture-specific handlers). These factors justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
