    "justification": "The class is small and simple: loc=21, nom=4 (nopm=4), wmc=5, and only 1 field (nof=1). It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LCOM=0.75 indicates moderate cohesion concerns, the overall size and complexity are low, so further decomposition is unlikely to meaningfully reduce size or implementation complexity."
