    "justification": "High lack of cohesion (LCOM = 0.75) indicates the class groups unrelated responsibilities. Although the class is small (LOC = 30, NOM = 4), the moderate complexity (WMC = 6) combined with low cohesion suggests it has multiple concerns that could be split. The single field (NOF = 1) and absence of external interactions (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) imply internal mixing of functionality rather than clear modular boundaries, supporting decomposition."
