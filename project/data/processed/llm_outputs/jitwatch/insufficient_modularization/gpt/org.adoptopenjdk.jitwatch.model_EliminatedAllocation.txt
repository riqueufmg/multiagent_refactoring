    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=20, nom=5, wmc=5, nof=2 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size and complexity and high cohesion. Fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling dependencies in the provided data. Given these metrics, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modular or would benefit from further decomposition."
