    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Multiple indicators show insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 983), very high method count (nom = 79) and many fields (nof = 74 / nopm = 59), and high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 174). The class depends on a wide and diverse set of components (UI stages, parser types, walkers, model classes, code-cache and graphing stages, viewer stages, config and util classes — see dependency list) which implies it handles many responsibilities (UI orchestration, parsing, reporting, code-cache and statistics, browsing/viewing, configuration). Although LCOM is low (0.0379), the combination of large size, high complexity and broad dependency surface indicates the class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization into smaller, responsibility-focused classes."
