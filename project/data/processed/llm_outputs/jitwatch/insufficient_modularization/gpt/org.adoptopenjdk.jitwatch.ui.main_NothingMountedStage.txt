    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.NothingMountedStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no evidence of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=44), low complexity (WMC=3), few methods (nom=3, nopm=3), no fields (nof=0), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already small, cohesive, and simple—further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
