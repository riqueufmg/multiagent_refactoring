    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.OSUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LCOM=1.0 (very low cohesion) and only 2 methods (NOM=2) that do not share state (only 1 field) indicates the class groups unrelated responsibilities. WMC=11 shows high implementation complexity concentrated in few methods, suggesting those methods contain multiple responsibilities that could be split. LOC=44 with fanin=0 and fanout=0 implies low coupling to other classes, making decomposition feasible. The presence of an inner/related type (OperatingSystem) in dependencies further suggests multiple concerns collected in this utility class. These metrics together indicate insufficient modularization and that the class would benefit from further decomposition."
