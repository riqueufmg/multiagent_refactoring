    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=22, NOM=4, WMC=5 indicate low size and complexity. LCOM=-1.0 shows high cohesion. There are no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=0 and NC=0 show no inheritance/children to suggest missed decomposition. These metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization."
