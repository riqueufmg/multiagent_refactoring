    "justification": "Metrics show a small, cohesive class: loc=42, nom=3, wmc=3, nof=3 and lcom=0.0. Low complexity (WMC=3), few methods/fields (nom=3, nof=3) and low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependencies are limited and there is no evidence of high implementation complexity or many responsibilities that would indicate the need for further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
