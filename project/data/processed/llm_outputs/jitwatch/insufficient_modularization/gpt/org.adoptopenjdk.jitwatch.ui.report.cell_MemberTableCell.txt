    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: 48 LOC, 4 methods (3 public), WMC=7 (moderate complexity) and LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). No inheritance depth (DIT=0), no nested classes (NC=0) and no measured incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although it has 6 fields, the overall size and cohesion do not indicate an undecomposed responsibility set that would benefit from further modularization."
