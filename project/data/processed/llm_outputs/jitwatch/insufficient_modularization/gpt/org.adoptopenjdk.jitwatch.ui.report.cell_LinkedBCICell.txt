    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=30, NOM=4 (3 public), WMC=7 (moderate complexity) and LCOM=0.0 indicating high cohesion. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 3 listed external dependencies). No large size, high complexity, or low cohesion metrics that would indicate it has not been sufficiently decomposed."
