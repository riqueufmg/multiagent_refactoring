    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal complexity: loc=9, nof=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0. Fan-in=0 and fan-out=0 and dependencies=[] indicate no coupling that would benefit from decomposition. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem given the lack of fields/methods. Therefore it is not a case of Insufficient Modularization."
