    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencesearch.FoundSequence",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class is small (loc=48) with only 2 fields and 6 methods (nof=2, nom=6), has high cohesion (lcom=0.0), no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no external coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although cyclomatic weight is moderately high (wmc=13), the overall size and cohesion suggest the class is adequately modular and does not require further decomposition."
