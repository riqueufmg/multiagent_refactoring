    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread.CompilerThreadStage.QueueCounter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=19, number of fields (nof)=3, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There is a single dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation). With no methods, minimal fields, low complexity and negligible coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or that further decomposition is needed."
