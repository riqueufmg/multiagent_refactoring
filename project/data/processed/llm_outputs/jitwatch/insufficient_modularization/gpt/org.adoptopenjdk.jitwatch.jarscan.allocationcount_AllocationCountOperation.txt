    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.allocationcount.AllocationCountOperation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=36), few methods (NOM=4, NOPM=3) and few fields (NOF=2). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Complexity is moderate (WMC=9) but not excessive given the low method count. Coupling is low (Fanout=0, only 3 listed dependencies). These metrics indicate the class is small, cohesive and not over-complex, so further decomposition is not justified."
