    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain.CompileChainStage.PlotNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is minimal in size and complexity: LOC=4, no methods (nom=0), two fields (nof=2), WMC=0, NC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, and no dependencies. There is no internal implementation complexity or large responsibility to decompose further. Based on these metrics (considering the class in isolation), it is not a case of Insufficient Modularization."
