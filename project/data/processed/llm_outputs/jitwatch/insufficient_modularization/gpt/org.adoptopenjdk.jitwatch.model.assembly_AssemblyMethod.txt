    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a missing decomposition: LOC = 73 (moderate size), NOM = 14 and WMC = 20 (method count and complexity are not excessively high), LCOM = 0.357 (shows reasonable cohesion), NOF = 7 (field count is moderate), fanin/fanout = 0 and only three dependencies (limited coupling). Taken in isolation, there is no clear evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities or excessive complexity that would justify further modularization."
