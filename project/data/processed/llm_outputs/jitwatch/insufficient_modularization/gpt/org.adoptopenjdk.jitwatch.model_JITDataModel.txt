    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate a class that is large and complex and likely combines multiple responsibilities: LOC = 228, NOM = 22, WMC = 50 (high cyclomatic/implementation complexity). The class depends on many distinct domain elements (16 listed dependencies including MetaMethod, MetaClass, PackageManager, JITEvent, Compilation, JITStats, CompilerThread, Tag, SourceMapper, etc.), suggesting it handles diverse concerns (events, metadata, packaging, stats, compilation, bytecode/source mapping). Although LCOM = 0.227 does not show extreme lack of cohesion, the combination of high method count, high complexity, substantial size, and many cross-cutting dependencies supports that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from modularization (splitting event handling, metadata management, compilation/stats and source-mapping responsibilities into smaller classes)."
