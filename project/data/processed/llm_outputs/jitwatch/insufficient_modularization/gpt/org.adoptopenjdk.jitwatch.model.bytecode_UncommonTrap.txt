    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC = 52 and NOM = 7 indicate limited size; WMC = 9 shows moderate complexity but not excessive; LCOM = 0.2857 indicates good cohesion. Few fields (NOF = 4) and no inheritance complexity (DIT = 0, NC = 0). Low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only a single listed dependency further reduce need for decomposition. These metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization."
