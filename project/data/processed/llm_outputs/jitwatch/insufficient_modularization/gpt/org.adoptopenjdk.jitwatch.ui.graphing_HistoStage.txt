    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small size (loc=85), few methods (nom=3, nopm=3), few fields (nof=2), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), moderate cyclomatic weight (wmc=7) and shallow inheritance (dit=2). Coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these values, there is no strong evidence that HistoStage needs further decomposition."
