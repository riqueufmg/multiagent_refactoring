    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=6, NOM=2, WMC=2 and NOPM=2, indicating few methods and low complexity. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0) and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics show no evidence of multiple responsibilities or excessive size/complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
