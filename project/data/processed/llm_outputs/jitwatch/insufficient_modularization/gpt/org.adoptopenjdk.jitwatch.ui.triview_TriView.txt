    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "TriView shows classic signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (LOC = 751), many methods (NOM = 55) and fields (NOF = 33), and very high implementation complexity (WMC = 173). It also references a large number of external types (28 dependencies), while having shallow inheritance (DIT = 1), indicating much behavior is concentrated in this single class. Although LCOM is low (0.127), indicating reasonable cohesion, the combination of large size and high complexity strongly suggests the class has not been decomposed enough and would benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
