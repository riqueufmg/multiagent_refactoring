    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing.TimeLineStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs that it bundles multiple responsibilities and would benefit from decomposition: relatively large size (loc = 200) and high complexity (WMC = 36) with a moderate number of methods (nom = 12) but few public APIs (nopm = 3) indicating many internal behaviors. It has several fields (nof = 5) and interacts with diverse dependencies spanning model, parsing, stats and UI concerns (IMetaMember, JITEvent, ParseUtil, JITStats, UserInterfaceUtil, Tag, JITWatchUI, Compilation), which suggests mixed responsibilities. Although cohesion is not extreme (LCOM = 0.166), the combined high LOC/WMC and varied dependency footprint justify refactoring into smaller, focused classes (for example: event parsing/processing, timeline data model/statistics, and UI rendering) to reduce size and implementation complexity."
