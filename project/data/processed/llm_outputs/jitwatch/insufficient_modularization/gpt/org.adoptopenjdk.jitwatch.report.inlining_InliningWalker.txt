    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.inlining.InliningWalker",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC = 14) for a small class (LOC = 52, NOM = 5), indicating complex methods that could be split. Cohesion is moderate/low (LCOM = 0.6), suggesting multiple responsibilities. The class depends on many external types (12 listed dependencies including Report/ReportType, multiple bytecode annotation and model types), which indicates it mixes responsibilities of walking/parsing bytecode annotations and producing/reporting results. A non-trivial inheritance depth (DIT = 3) adds to class complexity. Together these metrics (WMC=14, LOC=52, NOM=5, LCOM=0.6, 12 dependencies, DIT=3) justify flagging insufficient modularization and recommending decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
