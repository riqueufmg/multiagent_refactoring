    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.VMLanguageConfigStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The class is small/moderate in size (LOC=97) with a moderate number of methods (nom=9) and a WMC of 16 (average complexity per method ~1.8), indicating no excessive complexity concentrated in a single class. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0), suggesting related responsibilities are grouped appropriately. Field count is low (nof=4, nopf=0) and there are no reported high coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no strong evidence that the class has not been decomposed and therefore no indication of Insufficient Modularization."
