    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITStats",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very high number of methods (nom = 43) and public/implemented methods (nopm = 43) indicating many responsibilities; high weighted method count (wmc = 43) showing substantial implementation complexity; large number of fields (nof = 19) suggesting state that could be separated; non-trivial size (loc = 168). Taken in isolation, these metrics (nom, wmc, nof, loc) justify decomposing the class into smaller, focused classes or components to reduce size and complexity."
