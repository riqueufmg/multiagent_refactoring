    "justification": "Not detected: the type is very small (loc=11) with no fields (nof=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although it declares 9 methods (nom=9) and a matching WMC=9, these appear as simple interface signatures (DIT=0) rather than a large, complex implementation that needs decomposition."
