    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=11, NOM=3, WMC=3 and NOPM=3 indicate few methods and low cyclomatic complexity. It has only 1 field (NOF=1) and a single child (NC=1, DIT=2), so it does not exhibit size or breadth consistent with insufficient modularization. Although LCOM=0.666 suggests moderate cohesion issues, the overall small size and low method/complexity counts mean further decomposition is not indicated in isolation. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, showing no heavy coupling that would force internal decomposition."
