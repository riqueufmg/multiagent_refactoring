    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.ClassBC",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ClassBC shows signs of insufficient modularization: 23 methods (nom) and 134 LOC indicate a large class surface; WMC = 40 signals high implementation complexity concentrated in the class; 10 fields (nof) suggest multiple state responsibilities; LCOM = 0.3043 denotes only moderate cohesion (methods are not tightly focused); and it depends on multiple distinct concepts (MemberBytecode, ConstantPool, MemberSignatureParts, IMetaMember, StringUtil), which implies mixed responsibilities that could be split. Together these metrics justify that the class could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
