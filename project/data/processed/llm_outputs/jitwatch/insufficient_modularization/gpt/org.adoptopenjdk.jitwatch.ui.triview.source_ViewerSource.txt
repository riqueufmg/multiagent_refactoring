    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=28, NOM=2, WMC=5. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0). Coupling and external impact are low (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies limited). Shallow inheritance (DIT=1). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
