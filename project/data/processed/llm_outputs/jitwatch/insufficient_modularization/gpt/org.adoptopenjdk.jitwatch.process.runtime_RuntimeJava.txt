    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeJava",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, large or overly complex class: LOC=48 and NOM=4 show small size and few methods; NOF=2 indicates few fields; WMC=10 (average complexity ~2.5 per method) is moderate but not extreme; LCOM=0.5 indicates neither strong cohesion loss nor severe fragmentation; fanin=0 and fanout=0 with a single listed dependency imply the class is isolated and not tightly coupled. Given these values, there is insufficient evidence that this class requires further decomposition."
