    "justification": "Class is small and focused: LOC=37, methods=3, fields=1. Complexity is low (WMC=6). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on Opcode). Cohesion is moderate (LCOM≈0.67) and does not indicate multiple unrelated responsibilities. These metrics do not support further decomposition."
