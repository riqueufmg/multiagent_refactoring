    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (LOC=144) with high implementation complexity (WMC=29) and many methods (NOM=14) of which most are public (NOPM=11). It also has many fields (NOF=9) including several public fields (NOPF=5), increasing its surface area. Cohesion is moderate/low (LCOM=0.428), suggesting multiple responsibilities. These combined metrics indicate the class is not fully decomposed and could be split to reduce size and complexity."
