    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a large, complex holder of many responsibilities and should be decomposed. Evidence: very high number of methods (nom = 86) and public methods (nopm = 68), large size (loc = 568), high complexity (wmc = 142), and many fields (nof = 59). The presence of multiple nested/inner configuration types (CompressedOops, BackgroundCompilation, TieredCompilation, OnStackReplacement) indicates distinct sub-concerns that could be separated into smaller classes. Together these metrics show the class is doing too much and exhibits insufficient modularization."
