    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=20, nom=4, wmc=5 indicate low size and complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion. Low coupling and interaction: fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies limited to three types. No deep inheritance (dit=0). These elements do not indicate a need to further decompose the class."
