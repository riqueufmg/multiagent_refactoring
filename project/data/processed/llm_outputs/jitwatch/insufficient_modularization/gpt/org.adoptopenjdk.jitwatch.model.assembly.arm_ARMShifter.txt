    "detection": true,
    "justification": "WMC = 10 with only nom = 4 and loc = 28 indicates relatively high implementation complexity concentrated in a small class. LCOM = 0.75 shows low cohesion (methods are not closely related), and nopm = 3 public methods suggests multiple externally visible responsibilities. Together these metrics (high complexity, low cohesion, multiple public methods) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and could benefit from further decomposition."
