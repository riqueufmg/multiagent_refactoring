    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.ExceptionTable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=33, methods=6, fields=1. Complexity is moderate (WMC=9) but cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). It has no inheritance depth or children (DIT=0, NC=0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single dependency (ExceptionTableEntry). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and well-focused, not showing signs that it requires further decomposition."
