    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: 46 LOC, 2 fields (nof=2), 6 methods (nom=6), and LCOM=0.0 indicating high cohesion. Complexity is moderate but not excessive given the size (WMC=11). There are no external coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). These metrics do not support insufficient modularization."
