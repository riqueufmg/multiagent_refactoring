    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=20, NOM=3, WMC=4 and LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). It has few non-private methods (NOPM=2), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no external dependencies. These metrics show no evidence that the class is large or doing multiple responsibilities, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
