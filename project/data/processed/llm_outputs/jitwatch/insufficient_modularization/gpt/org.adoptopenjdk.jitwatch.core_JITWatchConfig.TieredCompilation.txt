    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is extremely small and non-complex: LOC = 1, NOM = 0, WMC = 0, NC = 0. Fan-in = 0, Fan-out = 0 and no dependencies. These values show no substantial size or implementation complexity to be reduced by further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
