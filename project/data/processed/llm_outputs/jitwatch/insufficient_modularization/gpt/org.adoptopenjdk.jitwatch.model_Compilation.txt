    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely case of Insufficient Modularization: it has a large number of methods (nom = 39) and fields (nof = 18), a substantial size (loc = 280) and high overall complexity (wmc = 71). These metrics indicate concentrated implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposing responsibilities. Although cohesion appears good (lcom = 0.1026), the high method count and cyclomatic weight suggest the class still contains multiple responsibilities or complex behaviors that would benefit from further decomposition. Additional supporting indicators: no inheritance depth to distribute functionality (dit = 0) and no reported fan-in/fan-out to imply external modularization (fanin = 0, fanout = 0)."
