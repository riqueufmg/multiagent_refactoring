    "justification": "nom=1, loc=3, wmc=1, fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[] indicate a very small, low-complexity, highly cohesive type (likely an interface). With only one method and 3 LOC there is no evidence that the class is too large or insufficiently decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
