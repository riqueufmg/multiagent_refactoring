    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyProcessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate a class that is likely doing too much: LOC=186 (large size), WMC=46 (high overall cyclomatic complexity), NOM=8 with NOPM=7 (many public methods, suggesting multiple responsibilities), NOF=10 (substantial state). Average complexity per method ~5.75 (WMC/NOM). LCOM=0.25 shows only moderate cohesion and does not counterbalance the size/complexity. Dependencies include both parsing/utility and architecture/model concerns (IAssemblyParser, AssemblyUtil, Architecture, AssemblyMethod), which suggests mixed responsibilities (parsing, processing, formatting/architecture handling). Taken in isolation, these factors justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
