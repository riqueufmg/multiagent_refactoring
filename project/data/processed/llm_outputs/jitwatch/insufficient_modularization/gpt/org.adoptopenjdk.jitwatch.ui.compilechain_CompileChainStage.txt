    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain.CompileChainStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate a class that is large and relatively complex: LOC=224, WMC=26, NOM=13, NOF=16. It also defines an inner class (CompileChainStage.PlotNode) and depends on many distinct concerns (UI: JITWatchUI, IStageAccessProxy, IMemberSelectedListener, RateLimitedResizeListener, UserInterfaceUtil, CompilationChooser; model: IMetaMember, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, Compilation; domain/logic: CompileChainWalker, CompileNode). The combination of substantial size/complexity, a non-trivial number of methods/fields, an embedded PlotNode type, and dependencies spanning UI, model, and chain processing suggests the class is handling multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed (for example: separate plotting/UI components, a controller/handler, and a model-adapter). Even though cohesion (LCOM=0.0) is not showing fragmentation, the other indicators (LOC, WMC, many methods/fields, inner class, and diverse dependencies) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
