    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: small size (LOC=45), small number of methods (nom=6), moderate cyclomatic/complexity (WMC=9) and moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.5). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, only one listed dependency), inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=2). These values suggest the class is not overly large, complex, or poorly cohesive in isolation, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
