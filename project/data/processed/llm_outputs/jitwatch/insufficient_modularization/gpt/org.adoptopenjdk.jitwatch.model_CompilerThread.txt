    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.CompilerThread",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has elevated implementation size and complexity (LOC = 78, NOM = 10) and a high weighted methods complexity (WMC = 22). WMC above common thresholds indicates the class contains complex behavior that could be split. These metrics together suggest the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
