    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing.AbstractGraphStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has moderate size and complexity (loc=199, nom=19, wmc=30, nof=23), its cohesion is high (lcom=0.1578947368421052) and it exposes a small public API (nopm=2). Depth of inheritance (dit=1) and limited coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) do not indicate multiple unrelated responsibilities. Overall metrics show a cohesive class with internal complexity rather than clear evidence that it should be decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
