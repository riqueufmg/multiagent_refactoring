    "justification": "Metrics show the class is trivial: loc=1, nof=0 (no fields), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), lcom=-1.0 (not applicable), fanin=0, fanout=0, and there are no dependencies. Insufficient Modularization is characterized by large size or high internal complexity that could be decomposed; these metrics indicate the opposite, so the smell is not detected."
