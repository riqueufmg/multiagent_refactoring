    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Considered in isolation: the class is small and cohesive. Metrics: loc=36, nom=7, nopm=6 indicate limited size/behaviour; wmc=10 shows only moderate complexity; lcom=-1.0 suggests high cohesion; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling pressure; dit=2 and only 3 external dependencies further limit complexity. These factors do not support Insufficient Modularization (no evidence the class is too large or insufficiently decomposed)."
