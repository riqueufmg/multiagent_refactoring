    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive, so insufficient modularization is not detected. Key metrics: LOC=26, NOM=5, NOF=3, WMC=6 (low-to-moderate complexity), LCOM=0.4 (acceptable cohesion). DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 indicate no inheritance depth or coupling that would suggest missed decomposition opportunities."
