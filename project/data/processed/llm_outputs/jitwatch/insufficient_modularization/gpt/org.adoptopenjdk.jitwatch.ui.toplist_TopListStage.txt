    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.toplist.TopListStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: moderate size (LOC=110) with a small number of methods (nom=9), limited fields (nof=4), and moderate cyclomatic complexity (WMC=16) — not unusually large or complex. Cohesion is good (LCOM=0.222), suggesting methods share related state and responsibilities. Coupling indicators show no incoming/outgoing usage in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these values and the limited dependency list, there is no strong evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
