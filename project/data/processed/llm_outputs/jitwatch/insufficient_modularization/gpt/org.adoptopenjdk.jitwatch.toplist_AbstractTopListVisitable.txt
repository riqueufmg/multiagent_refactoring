    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.AbstractTopListVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Do not detect Insufficient Modularization. The class is small and of moderate complexity (LOC=33, NOM=6, WMC=8), has no public fields (nopf=0), and shows acceptable cohesion (LCOM=0.5). Coupling indicators do not suggest broad responsibilities (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=2). These metrics do not indicate a large, complex class that clearly requires further decomposition."
