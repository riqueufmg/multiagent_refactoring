    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.ICompilationChangeListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is minimal and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=3), single method (NOM=1), low complexity (WMC=1), no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0), low coupling (FANOUT=0, FANIN=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=0). Given these metrics and only one dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember), there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
