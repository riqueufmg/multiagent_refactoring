    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount.InstructionSequence",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=26), small number of methods (nom=6), low complexity (wmc=7), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), only one field (nof=1) and zero coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single dependency. These values suggest the class is already small, cohesive, and not a candidate for further decomposition."
