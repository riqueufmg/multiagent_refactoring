    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread.CompilerThreadStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: large size (LOC=467) and high complexity (WMC=77) with many methods (NOM=28) and fields (NOF=17), indicating it likely contains multiple responsibilities. It depends on diverse concerns (UI and model APIs such as JITWatchUI, UserInterfaceUtil, IMetaMember, CompilerThread, Compilation) and even declares inner concerns (PlotMode, QueueCounter), which suggests responsibility mixing rather than clear decomposition. Although LCOM is low (0.107) meaning internal cohesion is present, the absolute size and complexity metrics (LOC, WMC, NOM, NOF) strongly indicate the class should be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
