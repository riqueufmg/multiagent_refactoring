    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=137 and WMC=31 show substantial size and cyclomatic complexity; NOM=15 with NOPM=12 indicates a large number of (especially public) methods / broad public surface; NOF=3 combined with many methods suggests the class is implementing multiple responsibilities rather than just managing a small state. LCOM=0.133 (low) shows cohesion is not poor but does not offset the high complexity and method count. FANOUT=0 (low external coupling) further suggests the class can be refactored/split with limited external coupling risk. Together these elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
