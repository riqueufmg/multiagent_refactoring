    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=20, NOM=2, WMC=3 (low complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). It has only 1 field (NOF=1), no public fields (NOPF=0), minimal public methods (NOPM=1), no inheritance (DIT=0, NC=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). These metrics indicate the class is already small and well-focused, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
