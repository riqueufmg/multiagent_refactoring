    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.ParserFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=12, number of methods=2, public methods=1. Complexity is low-to-moderate (WMC=5) and cohesion metric indicates high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). No inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its small size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized or that it requires further decomposition."
