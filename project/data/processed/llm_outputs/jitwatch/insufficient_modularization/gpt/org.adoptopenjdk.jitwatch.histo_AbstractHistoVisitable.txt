    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=18, WMC=4, NOM=4, NOF=3 indicating limited size and behavior; low coupling/interaction: FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 means it is isolated and not entangled with many other classes; inheritance depth and children (DIT=2, NC=4) are modest and do not imply a large monolithic hierarchy; although LCOM=0.75 suggests some cohesion concerns, the overall small size and low complexity do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
