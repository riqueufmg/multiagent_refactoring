    "justification": "Class is small and does not show signs of being insufficiently modularized: loc=31 (small), nom=3 (only three methods), wmc=6 (moderate complexity), nof=0 (no fields/responsibilities concentrated in data), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no broad dependency surface). There is no metric evidence (large LOC, many methods, high complexity or high coupling) that this class should be further decomposed."
