    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.BytecodeLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Evidence of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 541) and high implementation complexity (WMC = 119) while containing many methods (NOM = 25, of which NOPM = 6 public). The class depends on a large set of distinct bytecode- and loader-related types (e.g. BCParamConstant, BCParamNumeric, BCParamSwitch, BCParamString, IBytecodeParam, Opcode, BytecodeInstruction, MemberBytecode, ClassBC, LineTableEntry, ExceptionTableEntry, InnerClassRelationship, SourceMapper, ReflectionJavap, JavapProcess) indicating multiple responsibilities (parsing, mapping, interacting with javap, handling many param variants, section management). The presence of an inner type (BytecodeLoader.BytecodeSection) and many domain-specific dependencies suggests the class mixes parsing, mapping and process orchestration logic. Together, the large LOC, high WMC and broad dependency surface indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
