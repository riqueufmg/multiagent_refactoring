    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.OSUtil.OperatingSystem",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no evidence of being insufficiently modularized: extremely small size (loc=1), no fields or methods (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), zero nesting/children (nc=0, dit=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is minimal/empty in isolation, so further decomposition is not warranted."
