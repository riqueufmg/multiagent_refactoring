    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small size (LOC=36), low number of methods (NOM=5), modest complexity (WMC=8), few fields (NOF=5), and moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.4). No incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These values suggest the class is not large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition."
