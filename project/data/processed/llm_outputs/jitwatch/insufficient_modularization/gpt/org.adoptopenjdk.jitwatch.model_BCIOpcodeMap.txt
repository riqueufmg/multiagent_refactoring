    "justification": "Class is minimal and contains no decomposable behavior: loc=3, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), nof=1 (single field), fanin=0, fanout=0. With zero methods and very small size there is nothing to further decompose; metrics do not indicate excessive size, complexity, or coupling that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
