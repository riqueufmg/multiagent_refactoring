    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive (loc=27, nom=4, nof=2, LCOM=0.0) so there is no strong size/complexity signal that decomposition is needed. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). Although WMC=10 indicates some method complexity, given the overall small LOC and few methods the class does not appear to embody multiple responsibilities that warrant further modularization. Dependencies (MemberBytecode, ParseUtil, InvokeMethodCountMap, Opcode, BytecodeInstruction) are limited and do not imply excessive cross-cutting concerns."
