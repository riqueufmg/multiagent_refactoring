    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeAnnotationBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 474) and very high complexity (wmc = 97) combined with many methods (nom = 27, nopm = 9). It also has a large number of external dependencies (22 listed dependencies) suggesting multiple responsibilities. Although lcom = 0.0 indicates measured cohesion, the sheer volume of code and high cyclomatic complexity imply the class can be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. These metrics (LOC, WMC, NOM, and dependency count) justify flagging this class for further decomposition."
