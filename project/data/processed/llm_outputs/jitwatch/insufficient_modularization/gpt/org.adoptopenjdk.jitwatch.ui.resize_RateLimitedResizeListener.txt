    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize.RateLimitedResizeListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive. Metrics show LOC=48, NOM=4 (4 public methods), NOF=5, WMC=10 (moderate complexity distributed over few methods), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion), DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and only a single dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize.IRedrawable). Given the low size (48 lines), small number of methods, and high cohesion, there is no evidence this class has insufficient modularization or needs further decomposition."
