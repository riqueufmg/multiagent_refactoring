    "justification": "Indicators of insufficient modularization: high weighted methods complexity (wmc = 15) for a small class (loc = 44, nom = 5) suggests complexity is concentrated in a few methods and could be split; all methods appear exposed (nopm = 5 equals nom = 5) and there are no private fields (nopf = 0), which implies limited encapsulation and likely responsibilities that could be delegated to helper classes; although cohesion is high (lcom = 0.0), the combination of elevated WMC, limited method decomposition, and lack of private/internal state points to an opportunity to further decompose the class to reduce implementation complexity."
