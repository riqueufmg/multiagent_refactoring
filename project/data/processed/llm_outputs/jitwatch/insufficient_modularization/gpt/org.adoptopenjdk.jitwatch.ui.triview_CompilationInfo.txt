    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.CompilationInfo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small-to-moderate in size (LOC=95) with a small number of methods (NOM=5, public methods=4) and moderate cyclomatic complexity (WMC=10), indicating no excessive implementation density; cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) which argues against the need for further decomposition; coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 2 external dependencies listed) and there is no inheritance complexity (DIT=0, NC=0). Although it has 8 fields, the other metrics (few methods, high cohesion, moderate complexity) do not indicate an insufficient modularization smell."
