    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class does not show clear signs of insufficient modularization: size is moderate (loc=105) and method count is modest (nom=11); cyclomatic complexity is elevated but not extreme (wmc=15); cohesion is good (lcom=0.1818) which indicates related responsibilities; shallow inheritance (dit=1) and limited public API (nopm=5) imply focused role. Although field count is relatively high (nof=16), the low LCOM and moderate LOC/WMC suggest the class is cohesive rather than a monolithic candidate for decomposition. Dependencies are limited and do not indicate excessive coupling."
