    "justification": "Class is small and trivial: LOC=9, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods / no behavioral complexity). Fanin=0 and fanout=0 and no declared dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems requiring further decomposition. Given its minimal size and lack of implementation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
