    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has only 3 methods (nom=3) but a high weighted method complexity (wmc=12), indicating complex methods that likely combine multiple responsibilities. LOC is moderate (36) while LCOM is 1.0, signaling low cohesion among members. The class also depends on multiple assembly-related types (Architecture, IAssemblyParser, AssemblyParserARM, AssemblyParserX86), suggesting it handles logic for different architectures/parsers rather than delegating to finer-grained components. These factors (high WMC with few methods, high LCOM, and multiple parser-related dependencies) justify decomposition into smaller, more focused classes or methods."
