    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=20), few methods (nom=3, nopm=3), moderate complexity (wmc=6) but not large, high cohesion (lcom=-1.0), no fields (nof=0) and no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class appears small and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
