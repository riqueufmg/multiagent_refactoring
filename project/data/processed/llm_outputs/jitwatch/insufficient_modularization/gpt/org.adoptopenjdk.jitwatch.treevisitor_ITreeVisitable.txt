    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=4, NOM=2, WMC=2, NOF=0, FANOUT=0. Low method count, no fields, low complexity and no external coupling indicate it is already highly cohesive and not a candidate for further decomposition. Dependency on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember does not increase internal size/complexity."
