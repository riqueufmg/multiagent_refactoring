    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC 28), very few methods (nom 2, nopm 2), low complexity (WMC 5), high cohesion (LCOM 0.0), small number of fields (nof 2) and low coupling (fanin 0, fanout 0). DIT=2 alone does not imply poor decomposition. Overall the class appears adequately modular and does not show evidence that it must be further decomposed."
