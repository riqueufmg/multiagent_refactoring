    "justification": "Metrics indicate a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: LOC=132 (relatively large for a single utility class), WMC=25 (high aggregate complexity), NOM=8 with NOPM=6 (multiple methods, many public), and LCOM=0.625 (moderate-to-low cohesion). These values together suggest the class contains multiple responsibilities and internal complexity that could be reduced by decomposing into smaller, more focused classes or helper components."
