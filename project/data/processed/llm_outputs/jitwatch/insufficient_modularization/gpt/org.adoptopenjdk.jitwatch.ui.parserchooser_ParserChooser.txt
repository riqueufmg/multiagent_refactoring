    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=23, NOM=4, NOF=2, WMC=4. Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5) and there is no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). It has only two external type references. Given the low size, low complexity and limited responsibilities, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
