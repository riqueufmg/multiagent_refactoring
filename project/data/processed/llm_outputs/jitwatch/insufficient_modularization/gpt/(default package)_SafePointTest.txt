    "justification": "High lack of cohesion (LCOM = 0.6666666666666666) indicates methods operate on different subsets of fields; moderate complexity (WMC = 5) with 3 methods (NOM = 3) and 3 fields (NOF = 3) suggests multiple responsibilities concentrated in one class; small size (LOC = 22) does not negate the cohesion issue, and fanin/fanout = 0 shows the class is isolated and can be safely decomposed. These factors together justify Insufficient Modularization."
