    "justification": "High field count with little behavior: nof=41 vs nom=2 (nopm=2) indicates the class holds many fields but exposes very few methods. Low cohesion: lcom=1.0 shows fields/methods are not cohesive and likely represent multiple responsibilities. Size vs complexity: loc=88 with low WMC=5 suggests complexity arises from state (many fields) rather than focused behavior, supporting further decomposition into smaller, more cohesive classes."
