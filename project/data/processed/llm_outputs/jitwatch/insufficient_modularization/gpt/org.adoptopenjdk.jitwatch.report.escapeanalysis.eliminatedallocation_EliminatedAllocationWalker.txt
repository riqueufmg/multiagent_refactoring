    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=8, NOM=2, WMC=2 and NOF=0 indicate very low size and complexity. Coupling appears minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 suggests cohesion is not a problem. Given the low method count, low complexity and absence of fields, there is no evidence this class has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
