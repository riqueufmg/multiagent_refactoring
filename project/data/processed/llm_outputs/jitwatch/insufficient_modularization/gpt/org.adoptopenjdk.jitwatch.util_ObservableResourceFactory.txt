    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=36, NOM=7, WMC=9 (moderate complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). It has a single field (NOF=1) and no coupling indicated (FANOUT=0, FANIN=0). These metrics do not indicate an undivided, overly large or complex class that requires further decomposition."
