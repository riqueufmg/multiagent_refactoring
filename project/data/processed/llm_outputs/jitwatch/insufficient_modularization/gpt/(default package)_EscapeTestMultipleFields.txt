    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 fields but only 2 methods (nof=7, nom=2), yielding 3.5 fields per method, which suggests multiple independent responsibilities/data grouped in one class. LCOM=1.0 indicates very low cohesion (methods do not share field usage), supporting that behavior/data are not well decomposed. LOC=58 with WMC=5 shows non-trivial size but modest complexity, consistent with a class that primarily aggregates fields rather than a cohesive set of behaviors. These elements (high number of fields vs few methods, high LCOM) indicate Insufficient Modularization and that the class should be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive units."
