    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.HeadlessUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small (LOC=77) with a modest number of methods (nom=6) and only one public method (nopm=1). Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0) and there is no coupling evidence to other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although WMC=15 indicates some internal complexity, the overall size and high cohesion do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization—there is no clear sign that the class contains multiple independent responsibilities that should be split."
