    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxConfigStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 475), high complexity (WMC = 85), many methods (nom = 37) and many fields (nof = 16) while exposing relatively few public methods (nopm = 9). It depends on several distinct components (VMLanguageList, DisassemblyUtil, FileChooserList, IStageClosedListener, UserInterfaceUtil, JITWatchConfig), indicating multiple responsibilities. DIT = 0 (no inheritance) implies a monolithic implementation rather than decomposition via subclasses. Taken in isolation, these metrics (large LOC, high WMC, high method and field counts, multiple external dependencies) justify that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
