    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Tag",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high implementation size and complexity: 21 methods (nom), 177 LOC, and WMC=46. It has 8 fields and only 1 child/DIT=0 indicating it has not been decomposed via inheritance. Although LCOM=0.095 shows high cohesion, the large method count and high cyclomatic complexity indicate the class could be further modularized to reduce size and implementation complexity."
