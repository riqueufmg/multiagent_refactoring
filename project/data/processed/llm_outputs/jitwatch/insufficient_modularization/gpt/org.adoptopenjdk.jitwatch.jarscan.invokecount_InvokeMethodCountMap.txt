    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.invokecount.InvokeMethodCountMap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=20, NOM=2 (2 methods), NOF=1 (1 field), WMC=4 (low complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion), DIT=0. Coupling appears minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) despite dependencies on MethodCountMap and Opcode. These metrics indicate the class does not require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
