    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.MemberScore",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=14, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOF=2 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size, low complexity and high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0) and it depends only on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
