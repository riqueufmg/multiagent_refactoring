    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: loc=8, nom=2, nopm=1, wmc=2. It shows high cohesion (lcom=-1.0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only a few dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BCAnnotationType, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.LineAnnotation, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel). Although its inheritance depth is dit=4, the class size and complexity are low, so there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
