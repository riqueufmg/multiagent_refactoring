    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=15, NOM=3, WMC=3. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). No incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no nested complexity (nc=0, dit=0). Given the low size and low complexity metrics, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization or a need to further decompose this class."
