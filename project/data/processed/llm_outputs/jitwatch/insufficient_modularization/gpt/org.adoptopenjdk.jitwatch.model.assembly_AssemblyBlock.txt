    "justification": "Not detected: The class is small and cohesive — LOC=35, NOM=8, WMC=10 indicate modest size and complexity. LCOM=0.25 shows good cohesion. It has only NOF=2 fields and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependencies are limited to two types. Given the low size, moderate complexity, and high cohesion, further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or implementation complexity."
