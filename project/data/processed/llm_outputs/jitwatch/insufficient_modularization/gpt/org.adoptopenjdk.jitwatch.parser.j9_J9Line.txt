    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: although the class has 19 methods (nom = 19) and 143 lines of code (loc = 143), complexity is moderate (wmc = 22) and cohesion is high (lcom = 0.0). There is no evidence of excessive public state (nopf = 3) or extreme coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given the combination of moderate size/complexity and strong cohesion, there is no clear indication that the class should be further decomposed."
