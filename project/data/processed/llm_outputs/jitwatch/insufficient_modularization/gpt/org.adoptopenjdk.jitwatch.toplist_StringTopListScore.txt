    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=14, NOM=3, WMC=3 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM=0.0 suggests high cohesion. DIT=1 (shallow inheritance) and fanin=0/fanout=0 show limited coupling. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
