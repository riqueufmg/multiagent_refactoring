    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyInstruction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Multiple indicators point to insufficient modularization: the class has a high number of methods (nom=15, nopm=15) and substantial size (loc=178) combined with high complexity (wmc=41), which suggests it carries many responsibilities and implementation complexity that could be split; it also has a non-trivial number of fields (nof=8) increasing internal state to manage. The low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) means splitting into smaller classes would not create heavy external dependencies. Although cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), the overall method count, public API size, and complexity justify further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
