    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.TagProcessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs that it could be further decomposed: it is large (loc = 170) and has high implementation complexity (wmc = 41) while exposing a small number of methods (nom = 6, nopm = 3), which implies complexity is concentrated inside individual methods. It also has a non‑trivial number of fields (nof = 5) and depends on multiple concepts (dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConstants, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Task, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Tag), suggesting multiple responsibilities. Although LCOM = 0.0 indicates cohesion among members, the combination of high LOC and high WMC concentrated in few methods indicates that extracting responsibilities or helper classes/methods could reduce size and complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is detected."
