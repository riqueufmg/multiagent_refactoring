    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of methods (nom = 29) and a matching high weighted method count (wmc = 29), indicating many responsibilities and complexity concentrated in one type. It depends on multiple distinct concepts (MemberBytecode, AssemblyMethod, MemberSignatureParts, MetaClass, Compilation), suggesting mixed responsibilities (bytecode, assembly, signature, class/compilation concerns) that could be separated. The combination of many methods with cross-cutting dependencies justifies further decomposition to improve modularity."
