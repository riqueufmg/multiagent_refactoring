    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=32, WMC=3, NOM=3 with all methods public (NOPM=3). It has no fields (NOF=0) and no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low complexity metrics and small size indicate the class is already modular and does not show signs of being insufficiently decomposed."
