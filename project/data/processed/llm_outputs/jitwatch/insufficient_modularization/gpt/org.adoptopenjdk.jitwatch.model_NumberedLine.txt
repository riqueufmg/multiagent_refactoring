    "justification": "Metrics show a small, cohesive, low-complexity class: LOC=20, NOM=5, WMC=5, NOF=2. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show no coupling pressure, DIT=0 and NC=0 indicate no inheritance complexity. Given the small size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
