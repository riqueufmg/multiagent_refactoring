    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyReference.AssemblyReferenceHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class has a relatively large data footprint (nof = 9 fields) and moderate size (loc = 80) while declaring no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0). This combination suggests the class is a fat data holder that has not been further decomposed into smaller, focused classes. Cohesion metric is unreliable here (lcom = -1.0), so the decision relies on the high field count and class size. Additionally, zero coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) indicates it can be refactored or split with low external impact. These elements together justify Insufficient Modularization."
