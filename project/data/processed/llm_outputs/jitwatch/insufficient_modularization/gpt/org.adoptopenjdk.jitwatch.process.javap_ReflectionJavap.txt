    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: LOC = 94 (relatively small), NOM = 5 (few methods), NOF = 6 (not excessive fields). WMC = 12 is moderate but not extreme. LCOM = 0.0 indicates high cohesion, and fanin/fanout = 0 show low coupling. Only one external dependency is listed. These elements suggest the class is cohesive and not overly large or complex, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
