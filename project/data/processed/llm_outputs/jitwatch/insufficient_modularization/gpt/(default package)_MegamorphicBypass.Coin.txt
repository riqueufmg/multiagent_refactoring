    "justification": "Metrics show the class is extremely small and contains no decomposable content: loc=3, number of methods nom=0, number of fields nof=0, number of private fields nopf=0, weighted method complexity wmc=0, and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 is not indicative of a decomposition need given the absence of members. With no methods, fields, or complexity to split, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
