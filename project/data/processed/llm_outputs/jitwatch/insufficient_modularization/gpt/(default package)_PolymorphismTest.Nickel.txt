    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: very small size (loc=5), no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), no package methods (nopm=0), low complexity (wmc=0), no nested classes (nc=0), dit=0, LCOM=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0, and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is minimal and does not require further decomposition."
