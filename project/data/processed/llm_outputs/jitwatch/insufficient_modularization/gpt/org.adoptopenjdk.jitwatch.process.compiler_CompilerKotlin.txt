    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=29, WMC=5, NOM=2, NOPM=2 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size and low implementation complexity. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0, single dependency on ILogListener). Depth of inheritance (DIT=2) is modest. Given the low method count and good cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
