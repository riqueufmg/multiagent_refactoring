    "class": "(default package).EscapeTestManyFields.Wrapper1",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class declares a large number of fields (nof = 20) while having very small size (loc = 31) and no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0). This concentration of many attributes in a single, compact class indicates it likely bundles multiple responsibilities or data groups that could be separated. The cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) is not positive, and there are no dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) that would contradict splitting; therefore insufficient modularization is indicated and further decomposition should be considered."
