    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The type declares a high number of operations (nom=12) with a matching WMC of 12 while having very small physical size (loc=16), indicating many responsibilities concentrated in a single type. Its dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.SplitLog, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.ILogParseErrorListener, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.ParsedClasspath) span parsing, model population, configuration and error handling concerns. DIT=0 and nc=1 show no inheritance-based decomposition. These factors together suggest insufficient modularization and that the interface could be split into smaller, more focused interfaces/classes."
