    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear insufficient modularization: small size (loc=42), limited number of methods (nom=7) and fields (nof=2) indicate it is not overly large; complexity is moderate (wmc=11) and there is no coupling to or from other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although cohesion is only moderate (lcom=0.571), this alone, given the low LOC and small API surface, is insufficient to justify a decomposition recommendation."
