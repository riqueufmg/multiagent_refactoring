    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=12, WMC=3, NOM=2, NOPM=2. It has no fields (NOF=0), no package-private fields (NOPF=0), low inheritance depth (DIT=0), and shows high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies listed. Given the small size, low complexity, few responsibilities and lack of coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity — insufficient modularization is not detected."
