    "justification": "Class has only 2 methods (nom=2), small size (loc=17), low complexity (wmc=2), and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). No incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
