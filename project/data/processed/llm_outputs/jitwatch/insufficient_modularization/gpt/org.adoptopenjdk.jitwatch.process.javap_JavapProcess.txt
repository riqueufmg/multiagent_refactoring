    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.javap.JavapProcess",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=46, number of methods (nom)=4, WMC=9 (moderate complexity across few methods), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). It has few fields (nof=2), limited public surface (nopm=3, nopf=0), no external dependencies or fanout (fanout=0) and no children (nc=0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no indication that the class is too large or complex and requires further decomposition."
