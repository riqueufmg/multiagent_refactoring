    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 216 (large class size), WMC = 32 (high implementation complexity), NOF = 16 (many fields/state), NOM = 11 (many methods) with NOPM = 3 (few public methods → many internal helpers), which suggests internal complexity that could be split into smaller classes. Although LCOM = 0.1818 shows reasonable cohesion, the combination of large size and high complexity (LOC and WMC) plus many fields implies multiple responsibilities or significant internal behaviour that decomposition could reduce. The presence of an inner handler (AssemblyReferenceHandler) and other assembly-related dependencies further suggests separable concerns. Therefore insufficient modularization is detected."
