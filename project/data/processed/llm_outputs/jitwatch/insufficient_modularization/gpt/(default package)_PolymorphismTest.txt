    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: low number of methods (nom=2) but relatively high size (loc=43) and moderate cyclomatic complexity (wmc=6) — indicating large/complex methods; very low cohesion (lcom=1.0) means methods do not share state and likely implement unrelated responsibilities; single field (nof=1) with methods not cohesive supports need to split responsibilities into smaller classes/methods."
