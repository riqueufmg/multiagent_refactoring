    "justification": "Class is small and already simple: LOC=13, WMC=3, NOM=2, single field (NOF=1) and 1 public method (NOPM=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). No inheritance depth (DIT=0). These metrics do not indicate an undivided, overly large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition."
