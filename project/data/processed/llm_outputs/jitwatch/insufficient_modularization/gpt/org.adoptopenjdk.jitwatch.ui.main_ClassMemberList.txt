    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.ClassMemberList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a non-trivial size (loc=222), a moderate number of methods (nom=27) and a relatively high cyclomatic weight (wmc=45), the internal cohesion is strong (lcom=0.1111111111111111) and coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Field count is modest (nof=6) and there is no inheritance depth (dit=0). Taken in isolation, these metrics indicate the class implements a cohesive set of responsibilities rather than being an undivided, multi-responsibility blob, so there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization."
