    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow.HotThrowResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class shows moderate complexity (WMC=18) and a moderate number of methods (NOM=7, all public NOPM=7) and fields (NOF=4), it is small in size (LOC=51) and shows very high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Taken in isolation, the high cohesion and small footprint outweigh the single complexity metric, so there is no clear evidence that the class has not been decomposed and requires further modularization."
