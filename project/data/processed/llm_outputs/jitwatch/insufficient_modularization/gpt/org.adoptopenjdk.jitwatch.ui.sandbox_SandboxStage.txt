    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (LOC = 451), large number of methods (nom = 43), and very high complexity (WMC = 97) which indicate it is doing many responsibilities. It also has a substantial number of fields (nof = 11) and depends on many external types (17 listed dependencies), increasing coupling and suggesting multiple concerns are handled inside one class. Although LCOM is low (0.0465), implying methods share state, the combination of high LOC, high method count and very high complexity justifies decomposing the class into smaller, focused classes or components to reduce size and implementation complexity."
