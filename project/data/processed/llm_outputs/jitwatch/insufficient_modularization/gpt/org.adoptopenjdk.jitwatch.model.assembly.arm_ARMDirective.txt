    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=17, NOM=2, NOPF=1, LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and public surface is small. Although WMC=6 indicates some internal complexity, the overall size and method count are low, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
