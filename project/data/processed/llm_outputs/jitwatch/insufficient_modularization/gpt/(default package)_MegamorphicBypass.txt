    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High lack of cohesion (LCOM = 1.0) indicates the class's methods do not share state and likely represent separate responsibilities. Although small in size (LOC = 48) it has moderate complexity concentrated in few methods (NOM = 2, WMC = 7). The class holds only one field (NOF = 1) while methods remain independent, suggesting behavior could be split into smaller, more cohesive classes or modules to reduce complexity and improve modularization."
