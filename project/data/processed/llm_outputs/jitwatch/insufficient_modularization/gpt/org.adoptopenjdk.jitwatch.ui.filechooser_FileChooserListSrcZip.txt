    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.filechooser.FileChooserListSrcZip",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=23, nom=2, wmc=4, lcom=0.0, single field (nof=1). Low complexity and low coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0, one dependency). Depth of inheritance is minimal (dit=1). Metrics indicate the class is already small and well focused, so there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
