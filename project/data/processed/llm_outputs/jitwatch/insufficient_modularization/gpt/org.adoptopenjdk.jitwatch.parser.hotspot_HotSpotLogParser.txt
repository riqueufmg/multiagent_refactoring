    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.hotspot.HotSpotLogParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 253) and high complexity (WMC = 70) indicate it implements substantial logic that could be split. It defines a relatively large number of methods (nom = 19) while exposing few public methods (nopm = 1) and holding minimal state (nof = 1), which suggests procedural/utility behavior concentrated in one class rather than well-distributed responsibilities. The class depends on multiple distinct collaborators (Architecture, AssemblyProcessor, IJITListener, ParseUtil, VmVersionDetector, StringUtil, Tag, NumberedLine), implying it handles diverse concerns (parsing, assembly processing, VM/version handling, string utilities, event/listener interaction). Together these metrics and dependencies justify that the class is not fully decomposed and would benefit from refactoring into smaller, focused classes or components to reduce size and complexity."
