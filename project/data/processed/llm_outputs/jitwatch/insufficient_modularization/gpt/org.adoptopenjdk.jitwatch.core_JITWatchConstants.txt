    "justification": "Large number of fields (nof=283, nopf=282) combined with very few methods (nom=2, nopm=1) and substantial size (loc=296) indicates a monolithic constants container. Low cohesion indicator (lcom=1.0) and minimal behavior (wmc=2) show the class groups many unrelated data items rather than cohesive responsibilities. These metrics (high field count, high LOC, low method count/cohesion) justify detection of Insufficient Modularization."
