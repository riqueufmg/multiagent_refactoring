    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=72), modest number of methods (nom=8, nopm=7), moderate complexity (wmc=16) and high cohesion (lcom=0.0). The class has few fields (nof=4) and no reported incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these values, there is no strong evidence that the class is insufficiently decomposed."
