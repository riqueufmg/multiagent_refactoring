    "detection": true,
    "justification": "AssemblyParserARM shows characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: high complexity (wmc = 56) and substantial size (loc = 214) indicating heavy implementation burden; a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 6) and methods (nom = 9, nopm = 9) implying multiple responsibilities exposed; moderate cohesion (lcom = 0.4444444444444444) which suggests the class groups related but not tightly cohesive behavior; and zero fanin/fanout (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) meaning functionality is concentrated in this class rather than distributed. Together these metrics justify that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would likely benefit from further modularization."
