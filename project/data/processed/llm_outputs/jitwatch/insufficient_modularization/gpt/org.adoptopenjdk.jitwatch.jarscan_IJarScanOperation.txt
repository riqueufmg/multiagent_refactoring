    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=4, NOM=2, WMC=2 indicating low complexity and few responsibilities. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show no coupling pressure requiring decomposition. LCOM=-1.0 (likely not applicable for an interface) and DIT=0 do not indicate cohesion problems. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
