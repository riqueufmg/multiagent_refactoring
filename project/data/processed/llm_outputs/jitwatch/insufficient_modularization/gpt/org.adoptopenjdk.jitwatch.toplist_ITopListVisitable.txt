    "justification": "Class is minimal and already highly decomposed: nom=1 (single method), loc=3 (very small), wmc=1 (no complexity), nc=1, dit=1 (shallow hierarchy), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion concerns given single-method type). No dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is atomic and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
