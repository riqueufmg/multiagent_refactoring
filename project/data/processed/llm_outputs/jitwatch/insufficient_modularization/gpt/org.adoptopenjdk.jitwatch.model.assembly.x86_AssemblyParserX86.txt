    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 160 (sizey for a single class) combined with WMC = 37 (high cyclomatic/implementation complexity) while NOM = 7 (few methods with high aggregate complexity) suggests large/complex methods that could be split. LCOM = 0.571 indicates only moderate cohesion (methods are not tightly related), implying multiple responsibilities or separable concerns. NOF = 6 fields with these cohesion and complexity figures supports the probability of distinct subsets of state/behavior. FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 show the class is relatively isolated, so internal decomposition would not require heavy coupling changes. These metric signals together justify refactoring (splitting or extracting helper classes) to reduce size and complexity."
