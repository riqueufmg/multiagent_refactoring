    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.inline.HeadlessInlineVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modularized: it has high size (loc = 144) while exposing a small number of methods (nom = 4, nopm = 4), implying large/complex methods rather than decomposed responsibilities. It holds many fields (nof = 10) relative to its method count, suggesting concentrated state and multiple responsibilities. Complexity is moderate/high for a small interface (wmc = 9) and cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.5), indicating related functionality is not cleanly separated. The presence of an inner visitor (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.inline.HeadlessInlineVisitor.InlineJournalVisitor) further suggests bundled responsibilities that could be factored out. Taken together (high LOC, many fields, few methods, non‑low cohesion, inner class), these metrics indicate the class would benefit from further decomposition."
