    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.LineTable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs that it can be further decomposed: relatively large size (LOC=151), high number of methods (nom=17 with nopm=16 public methods) and elevated complexity (WMC=37). These metrics indicate substantial implementation surface and complexity that could be split into smaller components or helper classes to reduce size and simplify logic. Note: LCOM=0.176 indicates good cohesion, but the combination of many methods and high complexity still supports refactoring for better modularization. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 imply the class is isolated, which lowers risk for decomposition."
