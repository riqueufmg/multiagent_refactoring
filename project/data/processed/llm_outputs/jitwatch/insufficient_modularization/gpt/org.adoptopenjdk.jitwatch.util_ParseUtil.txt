    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.ParseUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 753), very high complexity (wmc = 200), large number of methods (nom = 46, of which nopm = 43 are public) and many fields (nof = 15, nopf = 13). It has numerous cross-cutting dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, StringUtil, MemberSignatureParts, PackageManager, LogParseException, JITWatchConstants, MetaClass, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, Tag, BytecodeInstruction, IParseDictionary, ClassUtil) suggesting multiple responsibilities (parsing different aspects: signatures, tags, bytecode, class/package management, string handling). Although LCOM = 0.1739 indicates some cohesion, the combination of very high LOC, WMC and method count indicates the class is doing too much and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, focused modules."
