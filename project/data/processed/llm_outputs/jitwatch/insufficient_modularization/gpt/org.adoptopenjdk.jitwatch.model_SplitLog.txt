    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.SplitLog",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and focused: LOC=36, 4 fields, 9 methods. Complexity is moderate (WMC=9) and not excessive. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). No inheritance (DIT=0) and no outgoing coupling shown (fanout=0, single dependency). Based on these metrics the class does not exhibit signs of being insufficiently modularized or a candidate for further decomposition."
