    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=77 (moderate size), NOM=9 and NOPM=9 (number of methods reasonable), WMC=15 (moderate complexity, not excessive), NOF=5 (few fields), LCOM=0.333 (good cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling evidence). Taken in isolation, the class size, cohesion and complexity do not justify further decomposition."
