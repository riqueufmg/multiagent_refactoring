    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.StaleTaskToplistVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and does not show signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=28 and NOM=3 indicate limited size and surface area, so there is little to decompose. WMC=8 yields an average complexity per method (~2.7) that is moderate and does not by itself justify splitting the class. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion (methods are related), and FANIN=0 / FANOUT=0 show low coupling to other classes. Although DIT=3 indicates inheritance depth, that alone does not imply the class should be further decomposed. Based on these metrics and considering the class in isolation, further decomposition is not warranted."
