    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.InliningFailReasonTopListVisitable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 77 (moderate size for a single class) and WMC = 14 (relatively high cyclomatic complexity concentrated in this class). NOM = 5 with NOPM = 4 indicates a small number of methods carrying substantial complexity rather than many small cohesive methods. LCOM = 0.4 (moderate/low cohesion) suggests the methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility. DIT = 3 increases the cognitive load and can hide mixed responsibilities. The class depends on multiple distinct concerns (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, StringUtil, CompilationUtil, Tag, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, IParseDictionary, LogParseException), indicating it touches parsing, model, compilation and utility responsibilities. Together these elements (LOC, WMC, LCOM, DIT and the variety of dependencies) justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition (extracting responsibilities or helper classes) to reduce size and complexity."
