    "justification": "Class is small and shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: LOC = 15 (very small), NOM = 0, NOF = 0, WMC = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0. There are no methods, no fields, no complexity and no dependencies; these metrics provide no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
