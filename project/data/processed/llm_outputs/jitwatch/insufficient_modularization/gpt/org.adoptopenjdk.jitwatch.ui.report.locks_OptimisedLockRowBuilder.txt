    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC = 69), modest complexity (WMC = 8), limited number of methods (nom = 8, nopm = 7), and no reported external coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). There is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would suggest the class should be further decomposed; LCOM = -1.0 does not provide a signal of low cohesion in the provided data. Therefore the smell is not detected."
