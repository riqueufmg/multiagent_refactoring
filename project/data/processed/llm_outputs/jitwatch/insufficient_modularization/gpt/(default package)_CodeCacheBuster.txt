    "class": "(default package).CodeCacheBuster",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits clear signs of Insufficient Modularization: extremely large size (loc=20010), an enormous number of methods (nom=5001, nopm=5001), and very high complexity (wmc=5002). These values indicate the class has not been decomposed into smaller responsibilities. Additional signals: only 1 field (nof=1) while containing thousands of methods suggests many unrelated behaviors bundled into one class, and it has no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) so decomposition would reduce internal size/complexity without cross-class impact. Given these metrics, the class should be split into multiple smaller, cohesive classes or modules."
