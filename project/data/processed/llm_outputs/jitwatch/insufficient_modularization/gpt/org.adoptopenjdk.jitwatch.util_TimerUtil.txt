    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.TimerUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and low complexity: loc=26, nom=2, wmc=4. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0) and there are no external coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). With only two methods and minimal size, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that decomposition would reduce size/complexity. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
