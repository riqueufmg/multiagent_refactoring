    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a moderate number of methods (nom=12) and a relatively high cyclomatic/complexity score (wmc=28), other indicators do not support Insufficient Modularization. The class size is small (loc=80) with a moderate number of fields (nof=7) and very high cohesion (lcom=0.0). It has no recorded incoming or outgoing coupling in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only depends on two types (ReportType, IMetaMember). Taken in isolation, the high WMC suggests some complex methods but the low LOC and perfect cohesion indicate the class is focused rather than a god class that needs decomposition, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
