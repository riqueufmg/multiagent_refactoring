    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: loc=29, nom=6, wmc=8. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. No external coupling indicated by fanin=0 and fanout=0. Inheritance depth is modest (dit=2) and dependency list is short (3). Given the low size, moderate complexity and high cohesion when considered in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
