    "justification": "Class is extremely small and contains no decomposable elements: loc=1, nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), nopf=0 (no public fields), wmc=0 (no complexity). Fan-in=0 and fan-out=0 indicate no coupling that would suggest hidden responsibilities. Given the absence of internal structure or complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
