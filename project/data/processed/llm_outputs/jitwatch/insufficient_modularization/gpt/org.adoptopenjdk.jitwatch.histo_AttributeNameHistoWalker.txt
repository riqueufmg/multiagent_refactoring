    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=22, nom=2 (nopm=2), nof=2. Low complexity and limited responsibilities: wmc=4. High cohesion: lcom=0.0. Low coupling/output interactions: fanout=0. Although dit=3 indicates inheritance depth, there is no evidence of a large, complex, or low-cohesion implementation that would benefit from further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
