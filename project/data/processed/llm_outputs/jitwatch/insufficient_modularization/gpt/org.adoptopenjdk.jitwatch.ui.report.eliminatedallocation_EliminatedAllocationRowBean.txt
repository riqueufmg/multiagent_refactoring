    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation.EliminatedAllocationRowBean",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (LOC=32) with a modest number of methods (NOM=6) and moderate complexity (WMC=8). Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0), coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0), and there are only a few dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
