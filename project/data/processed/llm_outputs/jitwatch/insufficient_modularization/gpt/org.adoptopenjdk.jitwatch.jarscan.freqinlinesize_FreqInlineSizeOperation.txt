    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.freqinlinesize.FreqInlineSizeOperation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=57), few methods (nom=4) and fields (nof=2), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only moderate complexity (wmc=9). Cohesion is reasonable (lcom=0.5). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no clear need to further decompose this class."
