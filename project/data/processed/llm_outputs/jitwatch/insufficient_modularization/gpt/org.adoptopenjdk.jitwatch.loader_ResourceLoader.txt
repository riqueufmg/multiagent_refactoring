    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.ResourceLoader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization: it has a single field (nof=1) and a moderate number of methods (nom=7) with total size loc=107, which is not excessively large. Cohesion is acceptable (LCOM=0.285), indicating related functionality is grouped. Although WMC=23 indicates some method complexity, this alone does not justify decomposition when cohesion is reasonable and coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, only two external dependencies). Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to mark this class as insufficiently modularized."
