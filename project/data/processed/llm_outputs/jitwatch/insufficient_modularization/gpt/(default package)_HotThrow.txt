    "justification": "LCOM=1.0 (complete lack of cohesion) combined with nom=3 (three methods) and nof=1 (only one field) suggests the methods do not operate on shared state and could be separated. LOC=25 and WMC=4 indicate non-trivial size/complexity for a single class. fanin=0 and fanout=0 imply the class is self-contained, making its independent responsibilities good candidates for decomposition."
