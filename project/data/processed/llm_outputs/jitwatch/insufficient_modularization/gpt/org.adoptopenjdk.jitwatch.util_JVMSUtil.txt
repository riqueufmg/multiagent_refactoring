    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=97, NOM=8 (NOPM=6), NOF=4. Cohesion is good (LCOM=0.25). Although WMC=19 shows some complexity, it is distributed across only 8 methods so the class size and method count do not indicate an undecomposed monster. External coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, 3 dependencies listed). Overall the metrics (low LOC, modest method count, good cohesion, limited external coupling) do not support detection of Insufficient Modularization."
