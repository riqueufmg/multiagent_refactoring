    "class": "(default package).PartialEscapeFail",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC = 30), very few methods (NOM = 2), low complexity (WMC = 4), high cohesion (LCOM = -1.0), and no coupling to/from other modules (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics indicate the class is compact and cohesive, so further decomposition is not justified."
