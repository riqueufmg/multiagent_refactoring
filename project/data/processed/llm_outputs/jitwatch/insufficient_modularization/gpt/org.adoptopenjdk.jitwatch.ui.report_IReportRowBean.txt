    "justification": "Class has very small size and no implementation to decompose: LOC=2, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0. It declares no fields or methods and has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics there is no evidence of a large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition."
