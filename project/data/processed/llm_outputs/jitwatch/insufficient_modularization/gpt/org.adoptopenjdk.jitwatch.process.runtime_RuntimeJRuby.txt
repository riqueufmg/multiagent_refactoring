    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=32, NOM=4, NOF=2. Complexity is low-to-moderate (WMC=7) and cohesion is acceptable (LCOM=0.5). There are no external usage/dependency signals (fanin=0, fanout=0) and public surface is small (NOPM=4). Given these metrics, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized or in need of further decomposition."
