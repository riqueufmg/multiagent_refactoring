    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.ReportStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation complexity (WMC = 19) combined with relatively small number of methods (nom = 5) indicates one or more methods are complex; moderate size (LOC = 86) and a field-to-method ratio (nof = 6 vs nom = 5) suggest the class holds substantial state/behavior. The class depends on many distinct report-related components (e.g. SuggestionRowBuilder, EliminatedAllocationRowBuilder, InliningRowBuilder, OptimisedLockRowBuilder, MemberTableCell, LinkedBCICell, ReportPackageFilter) implying multiple responsibilities/coordinations that could be split into smaller classes. Although LCOM = 0.0 shows cohesion by this metric, the combination of high WMC, multiple disparate dependencies, and concentrated responsibility indicates the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and is a candidate for modularization."
