    "justification": "Class is small and already modular: LOC=27, NOM=1 (only one method), NOPM=1, WMC=5 (single-method complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (indicates cohesion), DIT=1, FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (low coupling). Given the very small size, single responsibility and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
