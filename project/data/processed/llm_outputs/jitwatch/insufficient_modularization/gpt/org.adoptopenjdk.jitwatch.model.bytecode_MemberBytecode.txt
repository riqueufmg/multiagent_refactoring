    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has nontrivial complexity (wmc=30) and a moderate size (loc=112, nom=14, nof=8), its lack of cohesion is low (lcom=0.142857), indicating high internal cohesion. The class is not deep in an inheritance hierarchy (dit=0) and has no recorded external coupling in the provided metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the moderate LOC/NOM and the high cohesion, there is insufficient evidence that the class is an undecomposed multi-responsibility entity that would benefit from splitting. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
