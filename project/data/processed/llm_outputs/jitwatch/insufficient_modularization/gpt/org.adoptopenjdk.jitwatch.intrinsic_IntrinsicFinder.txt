    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic.IntrinsicFinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Evidence of insufficient modularization: the class has moderate size (LOC=89) but a high cyclomatic/maintenance burden (WMC=14) concentrated in few methods (nom=3, nopm=3) which indicates large/complex methods that likely contain multiple responsibilities. Cohesion is low (LCOM=0.6666666666666666), suggesting the fields and methods are not tightly related and the class mixes concerns. It also interacts with several different concepts (dependencies: IMetaMember, CompilationUtil, LogParseException, Tag, IParseDictionary), reinforcing the likelihood of multiple responsibilities. These factors together justify that the class should be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
