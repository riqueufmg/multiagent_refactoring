    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation complexity and size: WMC = 35 and LOC = 116 indicate concentrated complexity; moderate number of methods (NOM = 8, with NOPM = 5 public methods) suggests substantial behavioral surface. Low number of fields (NOF = 3) combined with high WMC implies the class is behavior-heavy and likely doing multiple tasks rather than delegating. Dependencies on multiple domain types (MemberBytecode, FoundSequence, BytecodeInstruction, Opcode) indicate the class interacts with several concerns. Although cohesion (LCOM = 0.25) is not extreme, it does not offset the high complexity and size — further decomposition could reduce WMC and LOC and improve modularity."
