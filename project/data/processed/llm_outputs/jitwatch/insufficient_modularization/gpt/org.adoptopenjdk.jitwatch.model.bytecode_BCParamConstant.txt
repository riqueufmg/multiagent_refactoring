    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=13, NOM=3, WMC=3, NOF=1, LCOM=0.0. Low size (LOC), low method count (NOM), low complexity (WMC), single field (NOF) and perfect cohesion (LCOM=0.0) indicate it is already well modularized. Additionally DIT=1 and no external coupling (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) reduce the likelihood that further decomposition would meaningfully lower size or complexity."
