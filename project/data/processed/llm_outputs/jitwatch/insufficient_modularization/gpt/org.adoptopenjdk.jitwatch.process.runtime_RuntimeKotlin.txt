    "justification": "LOC=35, NOM=4 and WMC=7 indicate small size and modest complexity; NOF=3 and few methods show limited scope; LCOM=0.5 shows only moderate cohesion but not strong evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate isolation rather than a large, tangled class. Overall metrics do not indicate a class large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
