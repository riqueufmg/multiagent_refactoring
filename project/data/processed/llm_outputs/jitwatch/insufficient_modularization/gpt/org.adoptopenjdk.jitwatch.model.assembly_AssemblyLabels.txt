    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyLabels",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small-to-moderate in size (loc=69) with a modest number of methods (nom=5) and fields (nof=5). Although weighted methods complexity is non-trivial (wmc=14), average complexity per method is moderate and does not by itself indicate a need to split. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), which implies related responsibilities and argues against further decomposition. Coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and the dependency list is short (AssemblyUtil, AssemblyInstruction, StringUtil). Taken in isolation, these elements do not justify Insufficient Modularization."
