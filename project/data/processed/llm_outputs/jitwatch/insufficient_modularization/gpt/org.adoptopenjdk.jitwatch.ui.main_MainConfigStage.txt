    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High complexity and size: LOC=122 and WMC=25 indicate substantial implementation complexity concentrated in this class; relatively few methods (nom=6) with a high aggregate complexity suggests large/complex methods that could be split. Multiple unrelated responsibilities suggested by dependencies: references to FileChooserList, FileChooserListSrcZip (file selection), StageManager and IStageClosedListener (stage lifecycle), Dialogs (UI dialogs), and JITWatchConfig (configuration) indicate this class handles several concerns (UI, file handling, stage management, configuration). Although LCOM=0.0 shows cohesion by metric, the combination of high WMC, moderate size, and diverse dependencies supports that further decomposition (separating file-chooser logic, stage lifecycle handling, and configuration UI/details) would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
