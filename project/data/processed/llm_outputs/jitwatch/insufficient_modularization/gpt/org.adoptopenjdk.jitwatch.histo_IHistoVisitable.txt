    "justification": "Class is very small and low-complexity: LOC=3, NOM=1, WMC=1, no fields (NOF=0). Low coupling: fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo.Histo. Depth of inheritance is minimal (DIT=1) and it has a single responsibility (one method), so there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
