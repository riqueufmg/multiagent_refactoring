    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.zing.ZingLogParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class shows size and complexity indicators typical of insufficient modularization: LOC = 230 (large implementation), WMC = 43 (high cyclomatic/implementation complexity), NOM = 12 with NOPM = 5 (many methods/behaviors exposed), and NOF = 7 (significant internal state). While LCOM = 0.333 indicates some cohesion, it does not offset the high overall complexity and size. The class also depends on multiple distinct collaborators (IJITListener, ZingLineType, ParseUtil, ZingLine, CompilerThread, NumberedLine, Tag), suggesting it handles several responsibilities (parsing, event/listener interaction, model construction). Taken in isolation, these metrics and dependencies indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
