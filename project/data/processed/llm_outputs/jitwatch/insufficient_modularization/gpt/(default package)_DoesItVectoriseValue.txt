        "Small size: loc = 36, indicating the class is compact and not large",
        "Low method count: nom = 6, suggesting limited responsibility surface",
        "Moderate complexity: wmc = 9 (not excessively high), so implementation complexity is not extreme",
        "High cohesion: lcom = -1.0, which indicates methods are well related and not a sign of multiple unrelated responsibilities",
        "No fields: nof = 0, so there is little internal state to partition across multiple classes",
        "No external coupling: fanin = 0 and fanout = 0, indicating the class is isolated and does not suggest splitting for dependency management"
