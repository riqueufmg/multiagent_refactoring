    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is minimal (loc=1) with no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), neutral LCOM (-1.0), and no coupling or dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its tiny size and lack of implementation, there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
