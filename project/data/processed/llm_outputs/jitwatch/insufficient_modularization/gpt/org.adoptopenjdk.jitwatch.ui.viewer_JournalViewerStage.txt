    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=33), only one method (NOM=1), moderate cyclomatic/weight (WMC=6), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only a few dependencies. In isolation this class appears compact and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
