    "justification": "High number of fields with no behavior: nof=20 while nom=0 and nopm=0, with small overall size loc=28. The class holds many fields but defines no methods (wmc=0), indicating an undecomposed data holder whose responsibilities can be split to reduce size and improve modularization. Additional metrics (lcom=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0) further indicate lack of internal modular structure."
