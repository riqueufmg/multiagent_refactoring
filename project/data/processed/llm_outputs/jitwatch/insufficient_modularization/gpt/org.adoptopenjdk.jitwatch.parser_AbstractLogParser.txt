    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.AbstractLogParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits size and complexity characteristics that indicate Insufficient Modularization: LOC = 374 (large), NOM = 35 methods, NOF = 17 fields, WMC = 80 (high complexity), NOPM = 13 public methods. It also has a large set of dependencies suggesting multiple responsibilities. Although LCOM = 0.057 indicates good cohesion, the combination of high method count, high cyclomatic complexity and large source size strongly suggests the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from splitting into smaller, focused components to reduce implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
