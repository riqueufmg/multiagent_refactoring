    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.LineAnnotation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=51, NOM=8, NOF=3 and LCOM=0.0 indicate a compact, highly cohesive class. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on BCAnnotationType). Although WMC=18 is moderate, on its own it does not indicate an undecomposed class given the low size and high cohesion. Therefore there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
