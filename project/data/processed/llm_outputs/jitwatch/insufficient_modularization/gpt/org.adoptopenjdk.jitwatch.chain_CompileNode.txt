    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain.CompileNode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 19) with many public methods (nopm = 17) indicating multiple responsibilities, high cyclomatic/weight metric (wmc = 28) indicating concentrated complexity, and a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 9) and lines of code (loc = 111). Although cohesion (lcom = 0.1579) is not extremely poor, the combination of high WMC and large public API surface suggests the class could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. Additional signals: depth of inheritance is 0 (dit = 0), meaning decomposition has not been achieved via subclasses, and the class depends on several distinct model/util utilities, implying multiple roles that could be separated."
