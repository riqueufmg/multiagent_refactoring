    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=18, NOM=4, WMC=4, NOF=2. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion. Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and modest inheritance depth (DIT=2) do not suggest an unmet need for decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
