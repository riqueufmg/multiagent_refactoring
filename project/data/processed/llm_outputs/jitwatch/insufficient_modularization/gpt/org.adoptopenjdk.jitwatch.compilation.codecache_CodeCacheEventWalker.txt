    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=44), few methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and only 2 fields, moderate overall complexity (wmc=9) but not large enough to require decomposition, cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.5), and coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a small set of dependencies. Taken in isolation, there is no clear evidence that this class is too large or complex and needs further decomposition."
