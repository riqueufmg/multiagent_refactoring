    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.ClassSearch",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. Although the class has moderate size (LOC=103) and complexity (WMC=28), it has a small number of methods (nom=10, nopm=6) and fields (nof=6). Crucially cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0), suggesting the methods are related and the class has a focused responsibility. There are no public fields (nopf=0) and no inheritance depth (dit=0) that would imply unresolved decomposition. On balance the metrics indicate a cohesive, moderately sized class rather than one that clearly needs further decomposition."
