    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an oversized or overly complex class that needs further decomposition: LOC=75 (moderate size), NOM=0 (no methods to split), NOF=3 (few fields), WMC=0 (no measured complexity), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (low coupling), single declared dependency (IReadOnlyJITDataModel). These elements suggest the class is small/simple in isolation, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
