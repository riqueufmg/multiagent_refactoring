    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=12, NOM=2 (NOPM=2), NOF=0. Complexity is low (WMC=4) and cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only two dependencies. Although DIT=3, the class itself shows no signs of excessive size or internal complexity that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
