    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: loc=1, nom=0, nof=0, nopm=0, wmc=0 indicate the class is trivial/empty; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling to decompose; lcom=-1.0 (no members) does not indicate cohesion problems. Given these metrics and no dependencies, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
