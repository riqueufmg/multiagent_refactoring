    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.escapeanalysis.AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=65, NOM=6 and only 1 field. Complexity is moderate (WMC=14) but not excessive for 6 methods (average complexity ~2.3/method). Cohesion is acceptable (LCOM=0.5). Coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no many public methods (nopm=3) or fields that would suggest multiple unrelated responsibilities. DIT=3 shows inheritance depth but does not by itself indicate a failure to decompose. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no strong evidence that the class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
