    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.LogParseException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=9, NOM=2, NOF=1 and WMC=2 indicate minimal size and low complexity. Coupling is nil (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no inheritance depth (DIT=0, NC=0). Although LCOM=1.0 could indicate methods do not share state, with only two methods and one field this does not provide strong evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no justification to flag Insufficient Modularization."
