    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LCOM=0.75 (low cohesion) combined with nom=4 methods and only nof=1 field indicates the methods do not share state and likely implement separate concerns. WMC=8 and LOC=41 show moderate complexity for a small class, suggesting non-trivial behavior concentrated in few methods. Dependencies on bytecode/signature/instruction types (MemberBytecode, MemberSignatureParts, BytecodeInstruction) imply involvement in multiple responsibilities (parsing/analysis/aggregation). These factors together indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition (Insufficient Modularization)."
