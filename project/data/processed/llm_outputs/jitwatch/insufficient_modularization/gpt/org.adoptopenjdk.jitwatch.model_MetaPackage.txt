    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: nom=16 and loc=89 show a moderate size; wmc=23 is elevated but not extreme; lcom=0.125 indicates high cohesion (low lack of cohesion); nof=5 (small number of fields) and fanin=0/fanout=0 with a single dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaClass) indicate low coupling. Taken in isolation, the class is cohesive and not large enough to justify further decomposition."
