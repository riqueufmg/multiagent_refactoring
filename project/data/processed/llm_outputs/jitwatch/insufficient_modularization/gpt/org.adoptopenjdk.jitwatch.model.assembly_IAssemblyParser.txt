    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.IAssemblyParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The type is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC is 17, WMC is 11 (matching the 11 declared methods) indicating low implementation complexity in isolation; DIT is 0 and there is no coupling reported (fanin 0, fanout 0). Dependencies are limited to four related types and the class has minimal size and cohesion metrics. Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
