    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The type exposes 12 methods (nom=12) with a matching weighted method complexity (wmc=12), which indicates multiple responsibilities/behavioral surface. It also depends on seven distinct types (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, PackageManager, MemberSignatureParts, MetaClass, JITStats, CompilerThread, Tag), showing coupling across several domains. The combination of many methods and cross-cutting dependencies, despite a small physical size (loc=14), suggests the interface/contract groups too many concerns and would benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more focused modules."
