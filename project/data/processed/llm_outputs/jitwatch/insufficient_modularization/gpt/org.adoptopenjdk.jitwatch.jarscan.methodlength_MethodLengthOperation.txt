    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class metrics indicate it is small and not overly complex: 4 methods (nom=4), 57 lines of code (loc=57), and moderate complexity (wmc=9). It has few fields (nof=2), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a limited set of external dependencies (4). Cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.5) but not indicative of a clear split opportunity. Given the low method count, modest LOC and bounded cyclomatic weight, there is insufficient evidence in isolation to justify further decomposition."
