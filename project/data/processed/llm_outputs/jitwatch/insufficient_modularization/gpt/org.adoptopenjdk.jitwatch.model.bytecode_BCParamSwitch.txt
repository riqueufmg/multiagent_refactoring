    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: 35 LOC, 6 methods (nom=6) and WMC=8 (avg complexity ≈1.3 per method). LCOM=0.333 indicates acceptable cohesion. Depth of inheritance is minimal (DIT=1) and there are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), so there is no evidence that the class aggregates unrelated responsibilities or is overly large/complex and would benefit from further decomposition."
