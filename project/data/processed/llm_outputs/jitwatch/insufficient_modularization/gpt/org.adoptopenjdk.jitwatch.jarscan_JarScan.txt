    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class appears insufficiently modular: it is large (loc=303) and complex (wmc=60), with a substantial number of methods (nom=14, nopm=8) which suggests multiple responsibilities concentrated in one class. It depends on many distinct operation types (FreqInlineSizeOperation, SequenceCountOperation, InvokeCountOperation, SequenceSearchOperation, AllocationCountOperation, MethodLengthOperation, InstructionCountOperation, MethodSizeHistoOperation, NextInstructionOperation, IJarScanOperation) and a BytecodeLoader/ClassBC, indicating it orchestrates multiple separate behaviors rather than delegating to smaller focused classes. These metrics and the breadth of dependencies justify decomposing the class into smaller modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
