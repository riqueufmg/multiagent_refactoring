    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerJava",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=31), few fields and methods (nof=2, nom=2), low/moderate complexity (wmc=6), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one external dependency. These metrics indicate the class is already small and focused, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
