    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: nom (number of methods) = 13 and loc = 125 indicate a relatively large class; WMC (weighted methods per class) = 31 indicates high implementation complexity concentrated in this class. Only nopm (number of public methods) = 2 while nom = 13 suggests many private/internal methods (helpers) supporting a small public interface — a typical indicator that internal behavior could be split into smaller classes. Although LCOM = 0.230769... shows reasonable cohesion, the combined size (loc), method count, and high WMC justify that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
