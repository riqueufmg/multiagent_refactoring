    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.AbstractMetaMember",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 38) and substantial size (loc = 311) combined with high complexity (wmc = 80) and many fields (nof = 11) indicate a large, complex implementation concentrated in a single class. The dependency set spans multiple distinct concerns (e.g. org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyMethod, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.ParseUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MemberSignatureParts, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.ClassBC), suggesting mixed responsibilities (bytecode handling, assembly mapping, parsing/signature processing, compilation-related logic) that could be separated. The class is shallow in the inheritance tree (dit = 1), so decomposition would require extracting responsibilities rather than relying on subclassing. Although LCOM is low (lcom = 0.0526315789473684) suggesting elements are related, the absolute size and high WMC justify refactoring into smaller, focused classes to reduce implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
