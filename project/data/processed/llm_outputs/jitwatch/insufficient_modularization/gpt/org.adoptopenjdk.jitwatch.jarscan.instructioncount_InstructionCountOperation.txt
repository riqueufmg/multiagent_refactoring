    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and reasonably cohesive: loc=48, nom=5, nof=2, nopm=4. Complexity is moderate (wmc=9) but not excessive, and cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.4). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is minimal (dit=1). Given these values and the limited dependencies, there is no strong evidence that the class has not been decomposed sufficiently."
