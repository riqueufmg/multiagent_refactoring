    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=12, NOM=2, WMC=4 indicate low size and moderate complexity. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling appears minimal (fan-in=0, fan-out=0). Although DIT=3 shows some inheritance depth, there is no evidence of a large, complex class that needs further decomposition. These metrics do not support insufficient modularization."
