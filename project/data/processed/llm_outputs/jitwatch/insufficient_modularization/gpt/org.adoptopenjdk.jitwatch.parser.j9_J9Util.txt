    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 36 LOC, indicating small size; WMC=7 shows moderate complexity but is not high for a candidate requiring decomposition. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0), so there is no evidence of responsibilities spread across many collaborators. LCOM is -1.0 (no signal of low cohesion). Given the small number of methods, low size, and low coupling when considered in isolation, there is no indication of Insufficient Modularization."
