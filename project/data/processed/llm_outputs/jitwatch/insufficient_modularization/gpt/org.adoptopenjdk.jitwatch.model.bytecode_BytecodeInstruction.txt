    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 181) combined with high cyclomatic/maintenance complexity (wmc = 47), a high number of methods (nom = 19) and many public methods (nopm = 17). These values indicate the class likely encapsulates multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce complexity. The dependency list (StringUtil, IBytecodeParam, Opcode, BCParamSwitch) suggests the class touches formatting/utilities, parameter handling and opcode concerns, reinforcing the likelihood of multiple responsibilities. Although LCOM = 0.0 indicates cohesion within the class, the absolute size and complexity metrics (loc, wmc, nom, nopm) justify recommending further decomposition."
