    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AbstractAssemblyParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate a likely insufficient modularization: LOC=138 (relatively large for a single class), WMC=32 (high overall complexity concentrated in few methods), NOM=4 / NOPM=4 (small number of methods with high complexity each → large methods that can be decomposed). LCOM=0.5 (only moderate cohesion) suggests the class groups multiple responsibilities. Dependency list shows responsibilities across multiple concerns: Architecture, AssemblyProcessor, AssemblyMethod, AssemblyInstruction, AssemblyBlock, AssemblyLabels and architecture-specific directives (x86 and ARM) — implying the parser handles parsing logic, architecture-specific directive handling, instruction/block/label construction and processor coordination. DIT=1 (no deep inheritance to delegate behavior) further supports splitting into helper/parser components. Together these elements justify that the class should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes (parsers/handlers per concern), so detection = true."
