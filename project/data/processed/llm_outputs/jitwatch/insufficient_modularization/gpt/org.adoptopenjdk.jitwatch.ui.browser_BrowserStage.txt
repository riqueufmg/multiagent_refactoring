    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and already well modularized: LOC=19, WMC=3 (low complexity), NOM=2 (few methods), NOF=2 (small state), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (low coupling), and only one external dependency. These elements do not suggest an insufficient modularization smell; further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity."
