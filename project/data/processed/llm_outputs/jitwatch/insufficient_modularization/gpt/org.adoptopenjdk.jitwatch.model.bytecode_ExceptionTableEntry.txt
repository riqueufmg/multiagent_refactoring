    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: loc=32, nom=6, nof=4, wmc=6. Low complexity (wmc=6) and very low size (loc=32) do not suggest a large, undecomposed implementation. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion (methods operate on shared state), and fanin=0/fanout=0 show no broad coupling that would imply multiple responsibilities. Given these values, there is no evidence in isolation that the class requires further decomposition."
