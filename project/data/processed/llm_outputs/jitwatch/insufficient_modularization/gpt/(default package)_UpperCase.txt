    "justification": "Low cohesion (lcom=0.6) — many methods do not share common state; single field (nof=1) vs multiple methods (nom=5) — methods likely operate independently; moderate complexity (wmc=9) for a small class (loc=40) — implementation complexity could be reduced by decomposition; small number of public methods (nopm=2) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) imply internal responsibilities can be separated without external impact."
