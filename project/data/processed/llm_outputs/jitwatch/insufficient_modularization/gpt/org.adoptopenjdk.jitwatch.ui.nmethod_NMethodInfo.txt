    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.NMethodInfo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a relatively large number of fields (nof=15) and moderate size (loc=154) and complexity (wmc=15), other indicators do not support insufficient modularization. The class has a modest number of methods (nom=12, nopm=5), very high cohesion (lcom=0.0) and few external dependencies, and no inheritance (dit=0). Taken in isolation, these metrics suggest the responsibilities are cohesive and complexity is manageable, so there is no clear need to further decompose the class."
