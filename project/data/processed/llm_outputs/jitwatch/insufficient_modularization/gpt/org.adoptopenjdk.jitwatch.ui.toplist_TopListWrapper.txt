    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.toplist.TopListWrapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=19), low complexity (wmc=4), few methods (nom=4) and fields (nof=3). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), and there is no evidence of high coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is compact and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted."
