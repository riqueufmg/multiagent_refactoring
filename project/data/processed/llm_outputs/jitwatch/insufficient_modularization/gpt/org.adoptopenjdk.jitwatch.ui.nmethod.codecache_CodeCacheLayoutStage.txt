    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Indicators show the class is a candidate for further decomposition: large size (loc = 291), high implementation complexity (wmc = 46), many methods (nom = 18) with a sizeable public surface (nopm = 11) and many fields (nof = 20). These metrics together suggest multiple responsibilities or complex internal logic that could be split to reduce size and complexity. Dependencies on multiple external types (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.CodeCacheEvent, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.codecache.CodeCacheWalkerResult, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation) further indicate varied interactions that may map to separable concerns. Although cohesion (lcom = 0.1667) is not high, the combination of high WMC, LOC, method and field counts justifies detecting Insufficient Modularization."
