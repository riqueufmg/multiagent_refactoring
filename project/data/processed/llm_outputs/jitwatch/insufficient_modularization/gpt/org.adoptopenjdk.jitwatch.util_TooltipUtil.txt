    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class: only nom=2 methods and loc=32 (small size); nof=0 (no fields) and nopm=1 (few public methods); LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate low coupling. WMC=7 is modest for a 2-method class and alone is insufficient to justify further decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
