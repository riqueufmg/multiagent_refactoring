    "justification": "High lack of cohesion (LCOM = 1.0) combined with a moderate size (LOC = 50) and relatively high complexity per method (WMC = 5 across only 2 methods) indicates the class groups responsibilities that are not well related. The class has 3 fields (NOF = 3) but only 2 methods (NOM = 2) and cohesion = 1.0, suggesting methods do not operate on shared state and the class can be further decomposed to improve modularization."
