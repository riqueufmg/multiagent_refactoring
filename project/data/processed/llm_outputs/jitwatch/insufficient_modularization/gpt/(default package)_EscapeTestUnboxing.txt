    "class": "(default package).EscapeTestUnboxing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=16, only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2), 1 field (nof=1), and a low-to-moderate cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc=4). It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics show no evidence of a large, high-complexity, or low-cohesion class that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
