    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.suggestion.SuggestionWalker",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics associated with Insufficient Modularization: large size (LOC = 310), high implementation complexity (WMC = 45), and a large amount of state (NOF = 32) while exposing relatively few methods (NOM = 10, NOPM = 3). It also has a non-trivial inheritance depth (DIT = 3) and relies on many external types (11 distinct dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.ReportType, IMetaMember, StringUtil, CodeCacheEvent, CompilationUtil, Report, ParseUtil, LogParseException, Tag, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, IParseDictionary), suggesting multiple responsibilities and coupling. Taken in isolation, these metrics (large LOC, high WMC, many fields vs few public methods, and numerous dependencies) justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
