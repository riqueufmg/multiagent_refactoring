    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow.HotThrowFinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has only 3 methods (nom = 3) but is large and complex (loc = 118, wmc = 20), indicating complexity concentrated in a few large methods. The number and variety of dependencies (MemberBytecode, IMetaMember, CompilationUtil, ParseUtil, LogParseException, ExceptionTable, ExceptionTableEntry, Tag, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, IParseDictionary, HotThrowResult) suggest multiple responsibilities (parsing, bytecode/exception-table handling, model interaction, result construction) that could be separated. Although LCOM = 0.0 indicates cohesion, the high WMC relative to a small number of methods and the length (LOC) imply that further decomposition (extracting helper classes or breaking large methods into focused collaborators) would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
