    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.IRuntime",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=5, number of methods=3 (nom=3), WMC=3. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). These metrics indicate low size and complexity and do not suggest an undecomposed, overly large class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
