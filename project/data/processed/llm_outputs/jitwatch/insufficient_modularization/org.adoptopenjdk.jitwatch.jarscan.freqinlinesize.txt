      "justification": "Class is small (57 LOC) with only 4 methods and 2 fields. Although WMC is 9, the overall size and method count are low, LCOM 0.5 indicates acceptable cohesion, and fanin/fanout are 0 showing low coupling. DIT is 1 (simple inheritance) and there is no evidence of a bloated interface or concentrated, separable responsibilities. Based on the provided metrics and context, there is insufficient evidence that this class suffers from inadequate modularization."
