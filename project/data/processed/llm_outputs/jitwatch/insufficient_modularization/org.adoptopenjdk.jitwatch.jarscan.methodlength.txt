      "justification": "Class is small (57 LOC) with only 4 methods (nom=4) and moderate complexity (WMC=9). LCOM=0.5 indicates only a mild cohesion concern, but not clear evidence of multiple distinct responsibilities. Depth of inheritance is minimal (DIT=1) and fanin/fanout are 0, showing low coupling and no large exposed/bloated interface. Given the small size and limited method count, there is insufficient evidence that this class suffers from insufficient modularization."
