The class depends on many different concerns (parsing, model interfaces, bytecode exception tables, compilation utilities), suggesting it mixes responsibilities (log/parse handling, bytecode/exception analysis, compilation mapping). These facts indicate the abstraction is not adequately decomposed and likely should be split into smaller, focused classes."

      "justification": "Small, focused holder of result-related functionality: 51 LOC, limited external coupling (depends only on IMetaMember), cohesive (LCOM=0.0) and likely encapsulates result state and accessors. Although method complexity exists (WMC=18 over 7 methods), the class appears to concentrate a single responsibility and does not show the wide mix of concerns seen in HotThrowFinder."
