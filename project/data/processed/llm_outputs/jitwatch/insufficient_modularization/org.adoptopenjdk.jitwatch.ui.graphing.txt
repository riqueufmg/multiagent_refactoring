Although cohesion metric is not high, the concentrated size and breadth of responsibilities suggest the abstraction has not been decomposed into smaller, focused classes."

As a single abstract stage holding substantial behavior and state used across graphing stages, it centralizes varied responsibilities (string/util handling, UI resize, parse utilities, tag handling) that could be split into smaller, more focused abstractions or helper components."
