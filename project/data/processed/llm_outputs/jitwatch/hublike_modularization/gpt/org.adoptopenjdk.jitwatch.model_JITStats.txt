    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JITStats has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has incoming references from four classes only: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stats.StatsStage, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing.TimeLineStage. Because it lacks outgoing links and is referenced by a small number of other abstractions (4), it does not meet the definition of a hub-like modularization (which requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
