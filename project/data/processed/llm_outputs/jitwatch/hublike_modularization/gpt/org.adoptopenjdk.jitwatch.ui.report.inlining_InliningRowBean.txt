    "detection": false,
    "justification": "InliningRowBean has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.ReportType, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here incoming dependencies are absent and the outgoing count is small, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
