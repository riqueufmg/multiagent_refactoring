    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. CompilerThreadStage has only one incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI) and a modest set of outgoing dependencies (7 total): org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread.CompilerThreadStage.QueueCounter, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread.CompilerThreadStage.PlotMode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.CompilerThread, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation. Because the class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections, it is not a hub."
