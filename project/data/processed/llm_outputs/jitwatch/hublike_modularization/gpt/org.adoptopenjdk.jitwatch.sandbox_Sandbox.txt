    "justification": "Sandbox has many outgoing dependencies (15) including org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.IRuntime, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.ICompiler, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.DisassemblyUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaClass, etc. However, it has only 2 incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxStage and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.EditorPane). Because the class does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections, it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell definition."
