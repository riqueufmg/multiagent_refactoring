    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.LineAnnotation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LineAnnotation has multiple incoming dependencies (referenced by BytecodeAnnotations, BytecodeAnnotationList, BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, OptimisedLocksWalker, EliminatedAllocationWalker, AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker, InliningWalker — 7 distinct callers), but only a single outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BCAnnotationType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here the outgoing fan-out is minimal, so the class does not meet the hub-like modularization smell."
