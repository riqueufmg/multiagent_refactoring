    "detection": true,
    "justification": "UserInterfaceUtil has a very large number of incoming dependencies (≈31 distinct classes depend on it) including JITWatchUI, TriView, SandboxStage, ReportStage, Dialogs, CodeCacheStage, HistoStage, CompileChainStage, StageManager, TopListStage, ViewerBytecode and many other UI components across multiple packages (ui.main, ui.triview, ui.sandbox, ui.graphing, ui.nmethod, etc.). It also has outgoing dependencies (2) to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BCAnnotationType and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.ObservableResourceFactory. The high total degree (incoming + outgoing ≈33) and the role as a central dependency for many unrelated modules indicate a hub-like modularization smell."
