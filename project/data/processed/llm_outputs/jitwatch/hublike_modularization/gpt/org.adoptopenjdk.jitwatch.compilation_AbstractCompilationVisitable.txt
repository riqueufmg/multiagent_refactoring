    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.AbstractCompilationVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []). It has only two direct outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Tag and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.CompilationUtil. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Given the absence of incoming links and only two outgoing links, this class does not meet the hub-like criterion. (Note: CompilationUtil itself depends on many types, but those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of AbstractCompilationVisitable.)"
