    "justification": "BackgroundCompilation has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
