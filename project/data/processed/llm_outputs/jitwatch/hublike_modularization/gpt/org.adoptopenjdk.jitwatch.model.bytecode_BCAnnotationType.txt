    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BCAnnotationType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BCAnnotationType has no outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only a modest set of incoming dependencies from 7 classes (UserInterfaceUtil, BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, LineAnnotation, OptimisedLocksWalker, EliminatedAllocationWalker, InliningWalker, ViewerBytecode). Because it has zero outgoing links and only a limited number of incoming links, it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell (which requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
