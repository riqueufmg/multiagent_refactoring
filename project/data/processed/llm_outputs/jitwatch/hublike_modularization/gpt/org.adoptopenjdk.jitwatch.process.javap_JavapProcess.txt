    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.javap.JavapProcess",

    "justification": "JavapProcess has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has a single incoming dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.BytecodeLoader is the only listed incoming class that references JavapProcess. Although BytecodeLoader itself depends on many classes (e.g. org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.InnerClassRelationship, MemberBytecode, ReflectionJavap, IBytecodeParam, MemberSignatureParts, BCParamSwitch, BytecodeLoader.BytecodeSection, ExceptionTableEntry, ClassBC, SourceMapper, Opcode, BCParamConstant, BCParamNumeric, MetaClass, LineTableEntry, StringUtil, BytecodeInstruction, BCParamString), JavapProcess does not have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships required to qualify as a hub-like modularization. Therefore detection = false."
