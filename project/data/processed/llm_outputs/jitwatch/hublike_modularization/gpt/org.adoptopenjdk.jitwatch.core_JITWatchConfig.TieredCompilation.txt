    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig). Although JITWatchConfig lists multiple dependencies, TieredCompilation itself is referenced by only one class and does not depend on other abstractions, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
