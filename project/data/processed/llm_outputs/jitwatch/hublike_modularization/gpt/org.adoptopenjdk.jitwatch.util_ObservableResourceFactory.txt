    "justification": "ObservableResourceFactory has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows neither, so it is not a hub."
