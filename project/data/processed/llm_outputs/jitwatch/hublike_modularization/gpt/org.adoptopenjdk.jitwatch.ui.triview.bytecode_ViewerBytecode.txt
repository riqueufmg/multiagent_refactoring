    "justification": "ViewerBytecode has a large number of outgoing dependencies (22 distinct types including org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, MemberBytecode, BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, BytecodeInstruction, ParseUtil, JVMSUtil, UserInterfaceUtil, etc.), but it has only a single incoming dependency in the provided data (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; here the incoming degree is low (1) despite the high outgoing degree (22), so it does not qualify as a hub-like modularization given the provided information."
