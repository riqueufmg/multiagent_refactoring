    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.ReportStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ReportStage has 12 outgoing dependencies (InliningRowBuilder, SuggestionRowBuilder, ReportStageType, UserInterfaceUtil, IStageAccessProxy, OptimisedLockRowBuilder, JITWatchConstants, EliminatedAllocationRowBuilder, MemberTableCell, JITWatchUI, ReportPackageFilter, LinkedBCICell) but only 2 incoming dependencies (JITWatchUI and ReportPackageFilter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships. The incoming degree here is low (2), so despite moderate outgoing coupling and some reciprocal coupling with JITWatchUI/ReportPackageFilter, ReportStage does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
