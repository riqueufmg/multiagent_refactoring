    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.instructioncount.InstructionCountOperation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "InstructionCountOperation has only 2 outgoing direct dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode) and a single incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides. Although MemberBytecode (one outgoing) itself depends on many classes, InstructionCountOperation itself does not directly exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
