    "justification": "PlotNode has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain.CompileChainStage). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and outgoing); the provided data (outgoing: [], incoming: [org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain.CompileChainStage]) does not meet that criterion."
