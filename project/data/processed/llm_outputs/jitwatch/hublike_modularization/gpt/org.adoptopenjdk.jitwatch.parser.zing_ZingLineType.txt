    "justification": "ZingLineType has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.zing.ZingLogParser and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.zing.ZingLine). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming AND many outgoing connections; since outgoing=0 and incoming is small, the smell is not present."
