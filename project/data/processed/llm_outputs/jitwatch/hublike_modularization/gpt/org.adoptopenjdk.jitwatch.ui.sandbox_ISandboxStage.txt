    "justification": "ISandboxStage has only 2 outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.EditorPane and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, and only 2 incoming dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox.Sandbox and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.EditorPane. Hub-like Modularization is characterized by an abstraction having dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low incoming/outgoing counts, so the smell is not detected."
