    "justification": "BytecodeLabel has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction) and only 2 incoming dependents (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.bytecode.ViewerBytecode). A hub-like module would have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; the provided data shows low incoming/outgoing counts, so it is not a hub."
