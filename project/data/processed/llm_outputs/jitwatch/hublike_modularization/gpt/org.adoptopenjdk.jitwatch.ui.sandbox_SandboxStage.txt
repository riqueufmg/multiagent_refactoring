    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. SandboxStage has a relatively large number of outgoing dependencies (18) — e.g. LanguageManager, Dialogs, UserInterfaceUtil, IStageAccessProxy, IMetaMember, JITWatchConfig, JITWatchConstants, NetUtil, IStageClosedListener, SandboxConfigStage, ILogParser, StageManager, DisassemblyUtil, EditorPane, Sandbox, JITWatchUI, IExternalProcess — but only a single incoming dependency in the provided data (JITWatchUI). Because the incoming degree is low (1) despite the many outgoing links, SandboxStage does not meet the definition of a hub (highly connected in both directions)."
