    "justification": "Incoming dependencies are empty (incoming_dependencies: []). Outgoing dependencies are limited to 3 distinct abstractions: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.ReportType, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation (outgoing_dependencies count = 3). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class has no incoming relations and only a small number of outgoing relations, so it does not meet the criteria for a hub."
