    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.locks.OptimisedLocksWalker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "OptimisedLocksWalker has only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (IReadOnlyJITDataModel, BCAnnotationType, LineAnnotation) and only 1 incoming dependency (JITWatchUI). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although IReadOnlyJITDataModel (one outgoing target) itself depends on several classes (Tag, MemberSignatureParts, IMetaMember, PackageManager, CompilerThread, JITStats, MetaClass), those are transitive connections through a single outgoing target, not multiple direct outgoing links from OptimisedLocksWalker. The single incoming reference (JITWatchUI), despite referencing many other types, does not make OptimisedLocksWalker a hub because it is only one incoming dependency. Therefore the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
