    "justification": "AssemblyParserX86 has outgoing dependencies to 4 classes: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyLabels, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.Architecture, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyUtil, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyInstruction. It has incoming dependency only from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyUtil (1). Because Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies, the limited number of incoming dependencies means this class is not acting as a hub."
