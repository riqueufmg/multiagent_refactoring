    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.ICompiler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ICompiler has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener) and 2 incoming dependents (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox.Sandbox). The total number of direct connections is small (3 distinct abstractions). Although the incoming classes themselves reference many other types, ICompiler itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies required to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
