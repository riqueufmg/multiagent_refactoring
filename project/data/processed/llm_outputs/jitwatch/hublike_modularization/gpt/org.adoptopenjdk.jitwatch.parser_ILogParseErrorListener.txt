    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.ILogParseErrorListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ILogParseErrorListener has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.AbstractLogParser and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.ILogParser). Because the abstraction does not have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. (Analysis considered the class in isolation as required.)"
