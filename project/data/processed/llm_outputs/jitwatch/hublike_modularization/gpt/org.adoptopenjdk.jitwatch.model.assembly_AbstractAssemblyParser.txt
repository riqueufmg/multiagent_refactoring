    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. AbstractAssemblyParser has outgoing dependencies to 8 classes: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.Architecture, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm.ARMDirective, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyMethod, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyInstruction, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyProcessor, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyLabels, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyBlock, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.x86.X86Directive, but it has zero incoming dependencies. Because it lacks incoming coupling, it does not meet the \"both incoming and outgoing with many abstractions\" criterion and is not detected as hub-like."
