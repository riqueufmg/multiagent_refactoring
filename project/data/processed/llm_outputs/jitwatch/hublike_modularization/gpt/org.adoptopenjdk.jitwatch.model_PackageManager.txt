    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.PackageManager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PackageManager has many incoming dependencies (at least from ParseUtil, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, JITDataModel, AssemblyProcessor, BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, ClassSearch, JITWatchUI) but only two outgoing dependencies (MetaPackage, MetaClass). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing; here the outgoing dependency set is small, so the class does not meet the hub-like modularization smell."
