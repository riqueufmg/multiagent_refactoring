    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITDataModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: JITDataModel depends on many classes (16 listed) including MetaPackage, JITEvent, ParseUtil, Tag, Compilation, IMetaMember, MemberSignatureParts, PackageManager, MetaMethod, MetaConstructor, CodeCacheEvent, CompilerThread, JITStats, MetaClass, SourceMapper, etc. Incoming dependencies: only 2 classes reference JITDataModel (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.AbstractLogParser and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.ILogParser). Because the class has a high number of outgoing dependencies but only a small number of incoming dependencies, it does not meet the definition of Hub-like Modularization (which requires large numbers of both incoming and outgoing relationships)."
