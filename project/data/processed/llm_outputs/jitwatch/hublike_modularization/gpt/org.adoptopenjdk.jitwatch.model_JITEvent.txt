    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITEvent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JITEvent has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (3): org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.EventType, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember. It has six incoming dependents: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.launch.LaunchHeadless, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.AbstractLogParser, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.IJITListener, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing.TimeLineStage. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Given the limited outgoing dependency set (3) and a moderate number of incoming dependents (6), JITEvent does not exhibit the high-degree bi-directional coupling characteristic of a hub; therefore the smell is not detected."
