    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Opcode is referenced by a large number of other classes (22 distinct incoming dependents including BytecodeLoader, BytecodeInstruction, MemberBytecode, BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, JVMSUtil, Task, multiple jarscan operations such as SequenceCountOperation, NextInstructionOperation, InvokeCountOperation, AllocationCountOperation, and viewer/utility classes). However, the provided data shows Opcode has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty). The definition of Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Because Opcode has many incoming but zero outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the full definition of a hub-like module."
