    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeJRuby",

    "justification": "RuntimeJRuby has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; the provided data does not show a large number of incoming or outgoing connections. Note: LanguageManager depends on many classes, but that results in a single incoming link to RuntimeJRuby in the given data."
