    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.NetUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NetUtil has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has incoming dependencies from two classes only: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.JVMSUtil and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxStage. Because the class lacks outgoing links and is referenced by a small number (2) of other abstractions, it does not meet the 'hub-like' criterion of having many both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
