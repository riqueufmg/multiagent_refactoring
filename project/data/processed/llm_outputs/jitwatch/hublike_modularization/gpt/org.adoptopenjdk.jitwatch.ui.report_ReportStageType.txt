    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.ReportStageType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ReportStageType has 0 outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only 2 incoming dependencies (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.ReportStage). The hub-like modularization smell requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; ReportStageType does not meet this criterion. (Note: while JITWatchUI references many classes, those are JITWatchUI's dependencies and do not make ReportStageType a hub.)"
