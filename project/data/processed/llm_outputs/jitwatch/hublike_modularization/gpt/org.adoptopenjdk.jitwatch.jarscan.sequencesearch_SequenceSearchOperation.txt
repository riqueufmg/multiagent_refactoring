    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencesearch.SequenceSearchOperation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SequenceSearchOperation has a small number of direct dependencies: 4 outgoing (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencesearch.FoundSequence, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode) and only 1 incoming (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan). Hub-like modularization is characterized by an abstraction having many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Because SequenceSearchOperation does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing direct dependencies, it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module. (Note: some of its dependent classes have many dependencies themselves, but evaluating the class in isolation shows a small direct dependency set.)"
