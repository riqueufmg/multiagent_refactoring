    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.MostUsedIntrinsicsTopListVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MostUsedIntrinsicsTopListVisitable has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic.IntrinsicFinder, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember. It has no incoming dependencies (0). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 3 (a small number). Therefore this class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
