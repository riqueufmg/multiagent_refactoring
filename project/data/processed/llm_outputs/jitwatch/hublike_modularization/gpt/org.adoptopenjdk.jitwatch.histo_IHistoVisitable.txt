    "justification": "IHistoVisitable has only one outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo.Histo) and a single incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing.HistoStage). A hub-like modularization requires dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only one incoming and one outgoing relationship, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
