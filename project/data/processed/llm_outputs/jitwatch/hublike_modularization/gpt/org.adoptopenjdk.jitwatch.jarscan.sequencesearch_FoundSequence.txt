    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. FoundSequence has only one outgoing dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MemberSignatureParts, and only one incoming dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencesearch.SequenceSearchOperation. Although MemberSignatureParts itself depends on multiple classes, by the requirement to consider the class in isolation, FoundSequence's direct incoming and outgoing counts are both 1, which is not a hub-like profile."
