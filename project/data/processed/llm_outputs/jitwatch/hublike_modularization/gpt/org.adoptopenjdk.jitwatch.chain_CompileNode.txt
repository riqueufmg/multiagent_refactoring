    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain.CompileNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CompileNode has 2 incoming dependencies (CompileChainWalker, CompileChainStage) and 5 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.ParseUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IParseDictionary, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation). Hub-like modularization is characterized by an abstraction having incoming and outgoing ties to a large number of other abstractions; the observed counts (incoming = 2, outgoing = 5) are modest and do not indicate a hub. Although the dependencies span utility and model interfaces, the quantity of distinct connections is not large enough to classify CompileNode as a hub."
