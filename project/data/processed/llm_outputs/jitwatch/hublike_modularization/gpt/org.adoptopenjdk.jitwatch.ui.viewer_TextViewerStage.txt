    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.viewer.TextViewerStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TextViewerStage has 2 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil) and 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI). These direct incoming/outgoing counts (1 incoming, 2 outgoing) are small and do not constitute dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Although JITWatchUI itself lists many dependencies, that does not increase TextViewerStage's own incoming/outgoing degree when the class is considered in isolation."
