    "justification": "CompilerScala has 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener) and 1 incoming dependency (referenced by org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; CompilerScala does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies based on the provided data."
