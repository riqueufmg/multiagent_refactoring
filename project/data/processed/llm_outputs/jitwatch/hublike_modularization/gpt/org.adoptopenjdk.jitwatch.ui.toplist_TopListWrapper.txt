    "justification": "TopListWrapper has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.ITopListVisitable) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.toplist.TopListStage). A hub-like modularization would show dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the counts are minimal. Although TopListStage itself depends on multiple other types, TopListWrapper is not connected to many different abstractions and therefore is not a hub."
