    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeAnnotations",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BytecodeAnnotations has a limited number of dependencies: 3 outgoing dependencies (BytecodeAnnotationList, LineAnnotation, IMetaMember) and 5 incoming dependents (MemberBytecode, BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker, InliningWalker, ViewerBytecode). While it is referenced by multiple clients across the package, the outgoing dependency count is small and the total degree (5 incoming + 3 outgoing = 8) does not indicate the high bidirectional coupling implied by a hub-like modularization smell. Therefore it is not detected as a hub."
