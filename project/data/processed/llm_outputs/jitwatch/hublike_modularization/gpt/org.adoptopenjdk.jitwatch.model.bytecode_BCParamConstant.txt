    "justification": "BCParamConstant has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has a single incoming dependency only from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.BytecodeLoader (incoming_dependencies count = 1). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing links); BCParamConstant's incoming = 1 and outgoing = 0, so it is not a hub."
