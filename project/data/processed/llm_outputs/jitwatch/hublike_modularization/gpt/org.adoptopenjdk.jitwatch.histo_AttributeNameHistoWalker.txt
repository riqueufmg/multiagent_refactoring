    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo.AttributeNameHistoWalker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AttributeNameHistoWalker has only two outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember) and zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. Although the two referenced interfaces themselves depend on several other types, the class under analysis does not have a large number of direct incoming or outgoing relations."
