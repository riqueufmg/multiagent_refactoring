    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.CompileTimeTopListVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections. Although the outgoing targets themselves depend on many other types, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
