    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IParseDictionary is referenced by a large number of other classes (18 incoming dependents such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.InliningFailReasonTopListVisitable, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.ParseUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.inlining.InliningWalker, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.CompilationUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain.CompileChainWalker), showing high incoming coupling. However its outgoing dependencies are small (only 3: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.BCIOpcodeMap, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Tag, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires many dependencies in both directions; here only the incoming degree is large while the outgoing degree is low, so it does not meet the full definition of a hub."
