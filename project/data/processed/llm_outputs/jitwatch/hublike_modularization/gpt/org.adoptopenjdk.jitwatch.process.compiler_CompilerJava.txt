    "justification": "CompilerJava has only one outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener) and only one incoming dependency (referenced by org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager). A hub-like modularization would exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows only a single incoming and a single outgoing relationship, so the smell is not present."
