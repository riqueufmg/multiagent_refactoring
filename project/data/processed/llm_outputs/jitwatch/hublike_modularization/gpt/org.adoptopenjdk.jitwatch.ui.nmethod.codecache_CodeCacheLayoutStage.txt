    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.codecache.CodeCacheLayoutStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CodeCacheLayoutStage has outgoing dependencies to six abstractions: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.CodeCacheEvent, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.codecache.CodeCacheWalkerResult. It has a single incoming dependent in the provided data (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI). Because the class does not show many incoming dependents and only a moderate number of outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the definition of Hub-like Modularization (which requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides)."
