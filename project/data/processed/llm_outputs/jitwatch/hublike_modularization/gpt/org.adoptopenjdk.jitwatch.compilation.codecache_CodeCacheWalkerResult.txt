    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CodeCacheWalkerResult has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.CodeCacheEvent) and 3 incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.codecache.CodeCacheEventWalker, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.codecache.CodeCacheLayoutStage). These are small numbers of incoming/outgoing links; therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization. Note: although JITWatchUI itself depends on many abstractions, that does not make CodeCacheWalkerResult a hub because the target class does not have a large number of direct incoming and outgoing dependencies."
