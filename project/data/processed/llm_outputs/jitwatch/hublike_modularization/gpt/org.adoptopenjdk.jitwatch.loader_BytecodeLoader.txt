    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BytecodeLoader has high outgoing coupling (depends on ~19 other abstractions, e.g. MemberBytecode, ClassBC, BytecodeInstruction, SourceMapper, ReflectionJavap, JavapProcess, MetaClass, StringUtil, BCParam* types, InnerClassRelationship, ExceptionTableEntry, LineTableEntry, Opcode, and an inner BytecodeSection). However, it has only 2 incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaClass). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming dependency count is low, so the smell is not detected."
