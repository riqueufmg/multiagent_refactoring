    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LinkedBCICell has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (3: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.IStageAccessProxy) and only one incoming dependency shown (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.ReportStage). Although those referenced classes themselves depend on multiple other types, the class under analysis has limited direct incoming and outgoing links and therefore does not meet the \"hub-like\" criterion of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
