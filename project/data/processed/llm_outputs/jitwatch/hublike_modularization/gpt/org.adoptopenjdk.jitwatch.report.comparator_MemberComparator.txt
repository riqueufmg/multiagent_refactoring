    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MemberComparator has only one outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows no incoming dependencies and a single outgoing dependency, so it does not qualify as a hub."
