    "detection": false,
    "justification": "InlineJournalVisitor has only 1 direct outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.inline.HeadlessInlineVisitor). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Although IReadOnlyJITDataModel itself depends on multiple classes, InlineJournalVisitor links to that single abstraction only, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
