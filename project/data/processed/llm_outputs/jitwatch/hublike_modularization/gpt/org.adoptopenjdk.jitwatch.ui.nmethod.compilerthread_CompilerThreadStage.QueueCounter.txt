    "detection": false,
    "justification": "QueueCounter has only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread.CompilerThreadStage) and 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation). These low counts do not constitute a hub-like modularization (which requires many incoming and outgoing relationships). Note: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation itself has multiple dependencies, but that does not make QueueCounter a hub given its single direct incoming and outgoing links."
