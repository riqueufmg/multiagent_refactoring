    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.MainConfigStage) and 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.FileUtil). Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
