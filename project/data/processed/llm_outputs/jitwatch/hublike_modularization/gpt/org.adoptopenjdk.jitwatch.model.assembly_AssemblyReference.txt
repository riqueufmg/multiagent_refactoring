    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyReference",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AssemblyReference has 3 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyReference.AssemblyReferenceHandler, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.Architecture, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm.MnemonicEntry) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly.ViewerAssembly). That yields connections with 4 other abstractions in total; this is a small number and does not constitute a hub-like modularization. Note: although ViewerAssembly itself depends on many classes, only one incoming class references AssemblyReference in the provided data."
