    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.escapeanalysis.eliminatedallocation.EliminatedAllocationWalker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "EliminatedAllocationWalker has a small number of outgoing dependencies (3): IReadOnlyJITDataModel, BCAnnotationType, and LineAnnotation. It has a single incoming dependency entry in the provided data (JITWatchUI). Hub-like Modularization requires both large incoming and large outgoing connectivity; here fan-out = 3 and fan-in = 1, which are low. Although one outgoing dependency (IReadOnlyJITDataModel) itself lists several dependencies, the analyzed class does not directly exhibit many incoming/outgoing relationships in the provided data, so it is not a hub."
