    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "IMetaMember is referenced by a very large number of other abstractions (~60 incoming dependents across many packages: e.g. org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.MemberScore, toplist visitors, histo walkers, parser.AbstractLogParser, util.ParseUtil, model.JITEvent, model.Compilation, model.MetaClass, many ui classes such as TriView and ViewerBytecode, report and analysis walkers, compilation utilities, hotthrow/inline/finders, etc.). It also has outgoing dependencies to several core types (5 direct outgoing: MemberSignatureParts, MemberBytecode, assembly.AssemblyMethod, Compilation, MetaClass). Several of those outgoing targets (e.g. MemberBytecode, MetaClass, Compilation) themselves connect to many other abstractions, so IMetaMember sits at the center of many incoming and outgoing relationships spanning multiple modules (toplist, histo, parser, bytecode, assembly, ui, report, compilation). The high fan-in combined with these outgoing links indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
