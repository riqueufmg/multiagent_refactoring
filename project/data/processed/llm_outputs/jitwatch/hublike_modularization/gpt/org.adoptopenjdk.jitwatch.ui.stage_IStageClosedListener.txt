    "justification": "IStageClosedListener has 0 outgoing dependencies (no referenced types) and 5 incoming dependencies from: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage.StageManager, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxConfigStage, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.VMLanguageConfigStage, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxStage, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.MainConfigStage. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies in both directions with a large number of other abstractions; here the class has only incoming references and no outgoing references, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
