    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.LogParseException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LogParseException has 0 outgoing dependencies and 18 incoming dependencies (referenced by classes such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.InliningFailReasonTopListVisitable, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.ParseUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.CompilationUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain.CompileChainWalker, etc.). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of dependencies in both directions (many incoming and many outgoing). Because LogParseException has no outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub (only widely referenced), so the smell is not detected."
