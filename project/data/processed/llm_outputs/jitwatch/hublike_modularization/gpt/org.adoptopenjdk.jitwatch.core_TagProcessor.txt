    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.TagProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TagProcessor has outgoing dependencies to 5 abstractions: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Tag, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConstants, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Task. It has a single incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.AbstractLogParser. Because the class does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies (only 1 incoming and 5 outgoing in the provided data), it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
