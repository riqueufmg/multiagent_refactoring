    "justification": "AbstractReportBuilder has outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor.TreeVisitor) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; the counts here (outgoing=2, incoming=0) are too small to qualify."
