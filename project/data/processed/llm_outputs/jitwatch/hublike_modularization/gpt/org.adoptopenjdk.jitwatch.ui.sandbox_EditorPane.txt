    "justification": "EditorPane has 5 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.Dialogs, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.ResourceLoader, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.ISandboxStage, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox.Sandbox) and 2 incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.ISandboxStage, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxStage). ISandboxStage appears on both lists (cyclic), yielding 6 distinct connected abstractions in total. This fan-in/fan-out is small and does not constitute a hub-like modularization. (Note: Sandbox has many dependencies, but those are transitive; the analysis is limited to EditorPane's direct incoming/outgoing relationships.)"
