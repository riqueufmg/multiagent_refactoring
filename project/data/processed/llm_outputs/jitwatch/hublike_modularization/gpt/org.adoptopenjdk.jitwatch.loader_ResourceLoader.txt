    "justification": "ResourceLoader has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.FileUtil) and 3 incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeKotlin, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.EditorPane, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView). These counts indicate limited direct coupling. Although LanguageManager (one outgoing) itself depends on many classes, ResourceLoader's own incoming and outgoing dependency counts are not large enough to qualify as hub-like modularization."
