    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 0 (no outgoing dependencies). Incoming dependencies: 1 (only org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.BytecodeLoader references this class). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections; BCParamNumeric has neither a large number of incoming dependents nor outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
