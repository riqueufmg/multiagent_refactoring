    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
