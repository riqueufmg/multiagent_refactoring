    "justification": "HeadlessUtil has a low number of incoming and outgoing connections. Incoming: only one incoming dependency is shown (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.launch.LaunchHeadless). Outgoing: HeadlessUtil depends on four classes (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaPackage, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember). Because both incoming (1) and outgoing (4) counts are small and limited to a few related model types, the class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
