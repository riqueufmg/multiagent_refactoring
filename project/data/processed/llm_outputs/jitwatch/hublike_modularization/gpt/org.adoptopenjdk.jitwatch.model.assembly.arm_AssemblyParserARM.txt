    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AssemblyParserARM has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyLabels, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.Architecture, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyUtil, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyInstruction. It has a single incoming dependency, from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyUtil. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the incoming fan-in is 1 and outgoing fan-out is 4, which does not constitute a high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
