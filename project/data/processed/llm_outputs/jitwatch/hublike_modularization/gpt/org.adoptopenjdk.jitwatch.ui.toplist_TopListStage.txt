    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.toplist.TopListStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization is present when an abstraction has many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. TopListStage has 6 outgoing dependencies (UserInterfaceUtil, IMetaMember, IMemberSelectedListener, TopListWrapper, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, ITopListScore) and only 1 incoming dependency (referenced by JITWatchUI). Because the incoming dependency count is low (1) while outgoing is moderate (6), TopListStage does not exhibit the characteristic large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships required for a hub-like modularization smell."
