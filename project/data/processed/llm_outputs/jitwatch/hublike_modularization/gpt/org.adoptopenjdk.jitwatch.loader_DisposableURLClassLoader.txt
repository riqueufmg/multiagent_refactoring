    "justification": "DisposableURLClassLoader has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.ClassUtil and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.javap.ReflectionJavap). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not meet that criterion."
