    "justification": "DisassemblyUtil has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.OSUtil) and is referenced by 3 incoming classes (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox.Sandbox, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxConfigStage, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxStage). These counts are low and do not constitute dependencies with a large number of other abstractions required for a Hub-like Modularization smell."
