    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StringUtil has a large number of incoming dependencies (39 distinct classes reference it, e.g. BytecodeLoader, HotSpotLogParser, ParseUtil, ViewerBytecode, CompilationUtil, Tag, SuggestionWalker), but zero outgoing dependencies (no listed dependencies from StringUtil to other abstractions). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because StringUtil has no outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the 'both incoming and outgoing' criterion for a hub-like module."
