    "justification": "ITopListScore has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.AbstractTopListVisitable and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.toplist.TopListStage). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not meet that criterion."
