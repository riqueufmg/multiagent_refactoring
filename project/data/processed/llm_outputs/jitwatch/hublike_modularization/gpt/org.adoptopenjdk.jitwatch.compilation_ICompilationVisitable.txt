    "justification": "ICompilationVisitable has a small number of direct relationships: 3 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IParseDictionary, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Tag, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.LogParseException) and 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.CompilationUtil). A hub-like modularization would exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies to many other abstractions; the provided data shows low fan-in (1) and low fan-out (3), so it does not qualify as hub-like."
