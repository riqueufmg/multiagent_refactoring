    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig.OnStackReplacement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies. Note: while JITWatchConfig references many classes, OnStackReplacement itself is referenced by only that single class and has no outgoing links."
