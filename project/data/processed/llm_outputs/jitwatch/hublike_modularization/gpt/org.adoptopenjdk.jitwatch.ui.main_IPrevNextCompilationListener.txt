    "justification": "IPrevNextCompilationListener has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.NMethodInfo). The incoming_dependencies list shows a single referencing class (NMethodInfo) among four dependencies it declares. This small number of incoming/outgoing links does not meet the \"large number of other abstractions\" criterion for Hub-like Modularization."
