    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BCIOpcodeMap has 0 outgoing dependencies and 3 incoming dependencies (IParseDictionary, ParseDictionary, BytecodeAnnotationBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Here the outgoing dependency count is zero and the number of incoming references (3) is small, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
