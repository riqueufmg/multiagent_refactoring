    "justification": "SplitLog has a small number of relations in the provided data: 2 incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.AbstractLogParser, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.ILogParser) and 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.NumberedLine). Total distinct related abstractions = 3. Hub-like Modularization indicates dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the observed connection counts are low, so SplitLog is not a hub by this data."
