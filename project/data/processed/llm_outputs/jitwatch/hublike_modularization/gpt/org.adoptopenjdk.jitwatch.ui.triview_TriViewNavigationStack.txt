    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TriViewNavigationStack has a small number of direct relationships: outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember) and incoming dependencies from 2 abstractions (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.bytecode.ViewerBytecode). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Given only 2 incoming and 2 outgoing direct ties (per the provided data), TriViewNavigationStack does not meet the \"hub-like\" criterion."
