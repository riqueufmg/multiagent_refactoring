    "justification": "InnerClassRelationship has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.BytecodeLoader). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows no outgoing links and a single incoming link, so it is not a hub."
