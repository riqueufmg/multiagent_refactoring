    "justification": "FileUtil has 3 incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.ResourceLoader, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox.Sandbox, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.filechooser.FileChooserListSrcZip) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; FileUtil has no outgoing dependencies and only a small number (3) of incoming dependents, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
