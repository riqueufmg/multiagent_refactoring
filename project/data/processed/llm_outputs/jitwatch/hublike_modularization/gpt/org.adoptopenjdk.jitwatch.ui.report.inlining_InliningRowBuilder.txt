    "justification": "InliningRowBuilder has 0 outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.ReportStage). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows only a single incoming reference and no outgoing references, so the smell is not present."
