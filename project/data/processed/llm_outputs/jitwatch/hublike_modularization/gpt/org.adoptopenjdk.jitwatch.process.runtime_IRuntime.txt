    "justification": "IRuntime has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener) and 2 incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox.Sandbox). These are small counts and do not show the large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships required to classify it as a hub-like modularization. (Although LanguageManager lists many dependencies, IRuntime itself is directly referenced by only two classes and directly depends on only one.)"
