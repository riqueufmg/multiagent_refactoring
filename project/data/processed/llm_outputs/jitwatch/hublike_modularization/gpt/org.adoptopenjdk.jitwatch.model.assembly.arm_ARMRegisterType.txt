    "justification": "ARMRegisterType has no outgoing dependencies (dependencies: []). It has only one incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly.ViewerAssembly). A hub-like modularization requires the abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; ARMRegisterType does not meet this criterion."
