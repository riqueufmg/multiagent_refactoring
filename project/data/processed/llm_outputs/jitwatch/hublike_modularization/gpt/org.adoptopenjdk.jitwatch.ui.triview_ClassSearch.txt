    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.ClassSearch",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ClassSearch has a small set of direct outgoing dependencies (4: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaPackage, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.PackageManager, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaClass) and only a single incoming dependency reported (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView). Although TriView itself depends on many classes, ClassSearch's direct incoming/outgoing coupling is low (incoming count = 1, outgoing count = 4), so it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module with large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
