Incoming dependencies: 1 (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction.NextInstructionOperation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class only has a single incoming and a single outgoing dependency, so it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
