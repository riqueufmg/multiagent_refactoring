    "justification": "The class has 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.toplist.TopListWrapper) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows only a single incoming link and no outgoing links, so the smell is not present."
