    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeAnnotationBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (22 distinct types) including IMetaMember, BCAnnotationType, MemberBytecode, BytecodeAnnotations, BytecodeInstruction, Opcode, IParseDictionary, ParseUtil, MetaClass, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, TooltipUtil, Compilation, PackageManager, etc., and is referenced by multiple incoming clients (at least 3 distinct classes: AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker, InliningWalker, ViewerBytecode). This combination of many outgoing ties to diverse abstractions across packages (model, model.bytecode, util, compilation) plus multiple incoming dependents indicates the class functions as a central hub with numerous incoming and outgoing relationships, meeting the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
