    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. VMLanguageList has 4 outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.VMLanguageConfigStage, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage.StageManager, and only 1 incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxConfigStage. The counts of incoming (1) and outgoing (4) are not large, so it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
