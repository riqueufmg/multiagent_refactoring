    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BrowserStage has a very small set of dependencies: only one outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil) and only one incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI). The referenced UserInterfaceUtil itself depends on just two classes (BCAnnotationType and ObservableResourceFactory). Because both incoming and outgoing connections are minimal, BrowserStage does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
