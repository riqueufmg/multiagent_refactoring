Outgoing count = 3 (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.Dialogs.Response, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.Dialogs.Dialog, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows only a modest number of incoming (5) and outgoing (3) relations, and two of the outgoing types are the class's own nested types. Therefore Dialogs does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module based on the given metrics."
