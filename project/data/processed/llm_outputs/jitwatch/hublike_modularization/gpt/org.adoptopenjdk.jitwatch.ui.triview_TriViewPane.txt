    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TriViewPane has only 3 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.Viewer, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil) and only 1 incoming dependency recorded (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; TriViewPane does not meet that condition. (Note: TriView itself has many dependencies, but that concerns TriView, not TriViewPane.)"
