    "justification": "LineTable has few outgoing dependencies (only 2: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.LineTableEntry) while it has a moderate number of incoming dependents (4: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.SourceMapper, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.bytecode.ViewerBytecode). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; LineTable does not exhibit a large number of outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
