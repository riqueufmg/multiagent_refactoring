    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.EventType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "EventType has 0 outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only 2 incoming dependents: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.AbstractLogParser and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITEvent. A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; EventType lacks outgoing dependencies and is referenced by only two classes, so it is not a hub."
