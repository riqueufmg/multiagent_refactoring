    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.CompiledAttributeTopListVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CompiledAttributeTopListVisitable has outgoing dependencies to only two abstractions: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. (Note: while IReadOnlyJITDataModel and IMetaMember themselves depend on many classes, that does not make CompiledAttributeTopListVisitable a hub because it directly references only two abstractions.)"
