    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although Tag is depended on by a large number of other abstractions (34 distinct incoming dependents such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.AbstractLogParser, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.CompilationUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.inlining.InliningWalker, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing.AbstractGraphStage, etc.), it has only a single outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; Tag exhibits many incoming but not many outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
