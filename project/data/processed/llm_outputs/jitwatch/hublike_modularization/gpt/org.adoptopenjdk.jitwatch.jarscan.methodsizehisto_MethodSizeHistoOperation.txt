    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.methodsizehisto.MethodSizeHistoOperation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MethodSizeHistoOperation has only 3 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MemberSignatureParts) and a single incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships; the provided data shows low fan-in (1) and low fan-out (3), so this class is not a hub. Note: although the referenced classes (e.g., MemberBytecode) and the JarScan client have many dependencies, that does not make MethodSizeHistoOperation itself a hub based on the direct incoming/outgoing counts given."
