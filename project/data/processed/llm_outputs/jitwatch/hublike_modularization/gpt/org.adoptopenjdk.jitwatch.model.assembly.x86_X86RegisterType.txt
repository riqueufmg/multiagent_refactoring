    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly.ViewerAssembly). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships with other abstractions. Although ViewerAssembly depends on many types (including X86RegisterType), X86RegisterType itself is referenced by only a single incoming class and has no outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
