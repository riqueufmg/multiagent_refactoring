    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MetaMethod has only one outgoing dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaClass, and is directly referenced by only one incoming abstraction: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITDataModel. Although JITDataModel depends on many classes, MetaMethod itself does not have a large number of distinct incoming and outgoing dependencies, so it does not qualify as a hub-like module."
