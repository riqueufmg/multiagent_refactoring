    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NextInstructionOperation has only 3 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount.InstructionSequence, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction.NextInstructionCountList, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode) and a single incoming dependency source (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan). Although JarScan references many operations, there is only one incoming class referencing NextInstructionOperation and only a small, focused set of outgoing dependencies, so the class does not exhibit a hub-like many-to-many dependency structure."
