    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.ExceptionTableEntry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ExceptionTableEntry has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It is referenced by five other abstractions (incoming from BytecodeLoader, MemberBytecode, BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, ExceptionTable, HotThrowFinder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies in both directions with a large number of other abstractions; here the class has only incoming references (5) and zero outgoing, so it does not qualify as a hub."
