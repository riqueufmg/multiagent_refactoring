    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.NativeMethodSizeTopListVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions. Although the outgoing targets themselves depend on many classes (IReadOnlyJITDataModel -> Tag, MemberSignatureParts, IMetaMember, PackageManager, CompilerThread, JITStats, MetaClass; IMetaMember -> MemberSignatureParts, MemberBytecode, AssemblyMethod, Compilation, MetaClass), the analyzed class itself does not exhibit the required large number of incoming/outgoing dependencies and therefore is not a hub."
