    "justification": "AnnotationException has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeAnnotationBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; these counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
