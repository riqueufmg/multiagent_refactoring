    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AbstractReportRowBean has only one outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data (outgoing count = 1, incoming count = 0) does not meet that condition. Note: Report's own dependencies (ReportType, IMetaMember) are not direct dependencies of AbstractReportRowBean."
