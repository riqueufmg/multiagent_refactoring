    "justification": "AssemblyLabel has only one direct outgoing dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyInstruction, and only one incoming dependent class: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly.ViewerAssembly. Although ViewerAssembly itself depends on many types, per the requirement to consider AssemblyLabel in isolation, AssemblyLabel does not exhibit many incoming and outgoing dependencies and therefore is not a hub-like module."
