    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.comparator.ScoreComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ScoreComparator has a very small set of direct connections: only 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report) and 2 incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.launch.LaunchHeadless and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI). The total number of distinct directly connected abstractions is 3, which is not a large number and therefore does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell. (Note: the Report class itself depends on ReportType and IMetaMember, but ScoreComparator's direct outgoing connections remain a single abstraction.)"
