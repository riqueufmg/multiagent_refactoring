    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MetaPackage is referenced by multiple other abstractions (incoming references from TreeVisitor, HeadlessUtil, PackageManager, MetaClass, JITDataModel, ClassSearch, ClassTree — 7 distinct incoming dependents) but has only a single outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaClass). The hub-like modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many incoming AND many outgoing dependencies; here outgoing coupling is minimal, so MetaPackage does not meet the hub-like criteria."
