    "justification": "Not detected: Report has many incoming dependencies (12 distinct classes reference it: AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker, MemberComparator, ScoreComparator, SuggestionWalker, InliningWalker, ViewerBytecode, EliminatedAllocationRowBean, AbstractReportRowBean, OptimisedLockRowBean, SuggestionRowBean, InliningRowBean, LinkedBCICell, MemberTableCell), but only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.ReportType and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing connectivity is small, so the smell is not present."
