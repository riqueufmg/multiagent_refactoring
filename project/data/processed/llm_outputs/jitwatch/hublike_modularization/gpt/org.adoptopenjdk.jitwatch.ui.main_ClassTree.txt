    "justification": "ClassTree has a small number of outgoing dependencies (4: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaPackage, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil) and a single incoming dependency listed (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. The provided metrics show low fan-out (4) and low fan-in (1), so ClassTree does not meet the criteria for a hub."
