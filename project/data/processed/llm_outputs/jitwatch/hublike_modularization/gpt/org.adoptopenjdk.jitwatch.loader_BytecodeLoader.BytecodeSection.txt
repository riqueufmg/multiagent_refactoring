    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BytecodeLoader.BytecodeSection has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.BytecodeLoader). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.BytecodeLoader lists many dependencies, BytecodeSection itself is not connected to many other abstractions, so the hub-like smell is not present."
