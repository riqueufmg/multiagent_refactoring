    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.Architecture",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although Architecture has many incoming dependencies (dependent classes include HotSpotLogParser, OSUtil, IAssemblyParser, AssemblyProcessor, AssemblyMethod, AssemblyReference, AssemblyUtil, AbstractAssemblyParser, AssemblyParserX86, AssemblyParserARM, ViewerAssembly), it has only a single outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of dependencies in both directions; here the outgoing coupling is minimal, so Architecture does not meet the definition."
