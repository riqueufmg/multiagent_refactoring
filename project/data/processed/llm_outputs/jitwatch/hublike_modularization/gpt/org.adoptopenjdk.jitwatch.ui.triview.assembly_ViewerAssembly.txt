    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly.ViewerAssembly",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ViewerAssembly has many outgoing dependencies (17 distinct referenced abstractions such as ILineListener, Architecture, MnemonicEntry, IStageAccessProxy, ARMRegisterType, IAssemblyParser, AssemblyMethod, AssemblyInstruction, StringUtil, ARMExtend, ARMShifter, AssemblyReference, AssemblyLabel, BytecodeInstruction, AssemblyUtil, X86RegisterType). However, its incoming dependency set is very small (only one incoming: TriView depends on ViewerAssembly). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing is large but incoming is minimal, so the smell is not detected."
