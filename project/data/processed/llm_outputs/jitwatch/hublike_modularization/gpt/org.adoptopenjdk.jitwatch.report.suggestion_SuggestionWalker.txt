    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.suggestion.SuggestionWalker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 12 distinct types (ParseUtil, Report, Tag, IMetaMember, IParseDictionary, ReportType, StringUtil, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, CodeCacheEvent, LogParseException, CompilationUtil, etc.). Incoming dependencies: only 2 known callers reference this class (LaunchHeadless, JITWatchUI). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; here SuggestionWalker has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies but a very small number of incoming dependents, so it does not meet the criterion for a hub-like module."
