    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.IBytecodeParam",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IBytecodeParam has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 3 incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.BytecodeLoader, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; IBytecodeParam lacks outgoing links and has a low in-degree, so it does not qualify as a hub."
