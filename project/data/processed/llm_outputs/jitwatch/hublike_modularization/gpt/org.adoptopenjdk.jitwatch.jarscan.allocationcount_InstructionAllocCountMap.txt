    "justification": "InstructionAllocCountMap has a small number of connections: 2 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.allocationcount.AllocCountMap, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.allocationcount.AllocationCountOperation). These low counts indicate it is not a hub-like module (which would have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
