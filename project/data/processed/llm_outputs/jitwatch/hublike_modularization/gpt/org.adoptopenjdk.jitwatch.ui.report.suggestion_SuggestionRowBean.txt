    "justification": "SuggestionRowBean has only a single outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies. (Report's own dependencies are not direct dependencies of SuggestionRowBean and do not make it a hub.)"
