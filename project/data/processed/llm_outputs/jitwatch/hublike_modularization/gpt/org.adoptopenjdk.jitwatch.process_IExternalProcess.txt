    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.IExternalProcess",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IExternalProcess has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox.Sandbox and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxStage). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Here outgoing = 0 and incoming = 2, so the class does not meet the hub-like criteria. Note: although the incoming classes reference many other types, analysis is limited to this class in isolation and does not change the dependency counts for IExternalProcess."
