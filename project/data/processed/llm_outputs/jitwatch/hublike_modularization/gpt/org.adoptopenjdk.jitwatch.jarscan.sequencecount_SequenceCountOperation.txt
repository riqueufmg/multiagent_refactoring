    "justification": "SequenceCountOperation has a small set of outgoing dependencies (4): org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount.InstructionSequence, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode. It has only a single incoming dependency recorded (referenced by org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan). Because it does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like modularization."
