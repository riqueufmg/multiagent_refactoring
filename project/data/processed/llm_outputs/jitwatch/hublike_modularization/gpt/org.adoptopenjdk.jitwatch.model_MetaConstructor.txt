    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MetaConstructor has only three outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConstants, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaClass, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil) and a single incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITDataModel. The total number of direct incoming/outgoing connections is small (4 distinct classes), so it does not meet the \"large number of other abstractions\" criterion for Hub-like Modularization."
