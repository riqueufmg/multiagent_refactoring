    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. InstructionLabel has only one outgoing dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.Viewer, and only one incoming dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.source.ViewerSource. Because both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are minimal (1 each), InstructionLabel does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
