    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: none (empty). Incoming dependencies: a single incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.ReportStage. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming AND outgoing dependencies; SuggestionRowBuilder has neither a large number of incoming dependencies nor any outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
