    "justification": "RuntimeJavaScript has only 1 outgoing dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener, and only 1 incoming dependency recorded: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
