    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BCParamSwitch has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 2 incoming dependencies (BytecodeLoader and BytecodeInstruction). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Neither condition is met: outgoing = 0 (none), incoming = 2 (BytecodeLoader, BytecodeInstruction). Note: BytecodeLoader itself depends on many other types, but those are not outgoing dependencies of BCParamSwitch and therefore do not make BCParamSwitch a hub."
