    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.filechooser.FileChooserList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FileChooserList has only one outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil) and is referenced by two incoming classes (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxConfigStage and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.MainConfigStage). The class does not exhibit dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (only 1 outgoing and 2 incoming), so it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
