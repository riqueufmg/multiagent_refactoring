    "justification": "ClassMemberList has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct abstractions: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic.IntrinsicFinder, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.IStageAccessProxy, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.IMemberSelectedListener, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaClass. It has a single incoming dependency listed (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the outgoing set is moderate (7) and the incoming set is minimal (1), so it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
