    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (0) and no outgoing dependencies (0) — analyzed_package.dependencies is empty and both incoming_dependencies and outgoing_dependencies lists are empty. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that condition."
