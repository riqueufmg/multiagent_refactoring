    "detection": true,
    "justification": "JITWatchConfig has a large number of incoming dependencies (17 distinct classes depend on it, e.g. LaunchHeadless, AbstractLogParser, ILogParser, LanguageManager, Sandbox, SandboxStage, TriView, JITWatchUI) while also depending on multiple other abstractions (7 outgoing dependencies: JITWatchConstants, ParsedClasspath, StringUtil and its nested configuration types CompressedOops, BackgroundCompilation, TieredCompilation, OnStackReplacement). The presence of many callers across parsers, UI stages, runtime/language managers and sandbox components combined with several outgoing links indicates JITWatchConfig functions as a central hub-like abstraction, meeting the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
