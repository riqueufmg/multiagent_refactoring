    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo.CompileTimeHistoWalker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CompileTimeHistoWalker has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class's low outgoing degree (2) and absence of incoming dependencies do not meet that criterion. (Note: the two target interfaces themselves have many dependencies, but the smell is evaluated for CompileTimeHistoWalker in isolation.)"
