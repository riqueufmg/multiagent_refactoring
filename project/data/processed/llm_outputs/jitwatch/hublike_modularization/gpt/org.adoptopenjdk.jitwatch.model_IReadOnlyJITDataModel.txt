    "justification": "IReadOnlyJITDataModel acts as a hub: it has a large number of incoming dependencies (39 distinct client classes across packages such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist (e.g. NativeMethodSizeTopListVisitable, CompileTimeTopListVisitable), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo (e.g. AbstractHistoVisitable, NativeSizeHistoWalker), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui (e.g. TriView, TopListStage, JITWatchUI), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report and many compilation/chain/inline walkers). It also has multiple outgoing dependencies (7) on core model abstractions: Tag, MemberSignatureParts, IMetaMember, PackageManager, CompilerThread, JITStats, MetaClass. There is bidirectional coupling with MetaClass (MetaClass lists IReadOnlyJITDataModel as a dependency). The combination of many diverse incoming clients and multiple outgoing ties to core model classes indicates Hub-like Modularization."
