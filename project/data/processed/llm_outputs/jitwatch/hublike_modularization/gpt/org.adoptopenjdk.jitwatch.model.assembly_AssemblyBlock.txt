    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyBlock",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AssemblyBlock has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyInstruction, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil) and is referenced by 2 incoming classes (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyMethod, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AbstractAssemblyParser). The total distinct connected abstractions are limited (4). Although AbstractAssemblyParser itself depends on many types, AssemblyBlock’s own incoming and outgoing degree is low, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
