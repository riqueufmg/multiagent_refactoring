    "justification": "CompilerJRuby has 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener) and 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager). That yields only 2 direct connected abstractions; there are not a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
