    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.ICompilationChangeListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ICompilationChangeListener has only one incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage.StageManager) and only one direct outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember). Although IMetaMember itself depends on multiple types, the analyzed class directly connects to only a single abstraction in each direction, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
