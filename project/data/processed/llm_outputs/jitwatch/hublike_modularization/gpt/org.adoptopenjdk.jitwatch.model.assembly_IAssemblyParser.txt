    "justification": "IAssemblyParser has a small set of outgoing dependencies (4): org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyLabels, Architecture, AssemblyMethod, AssemblyInstruction. It has a small set of incoming dependencies (3): org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyProcessor, AssemblyUtil, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly.ViewerAssembly. The number of both incoming and outgoing links is modest and limited to related assembly/model classes, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
