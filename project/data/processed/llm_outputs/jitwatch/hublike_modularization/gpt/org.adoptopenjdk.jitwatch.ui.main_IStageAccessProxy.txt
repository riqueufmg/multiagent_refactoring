    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.IStageAccessProxy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IStageAccessProxy has many incoming dependencies (10 distinct client classes reference it: SandboxStage, Viewer, ViewerAssembly, ViewerBytecode, ViewerSource, ClassMemberList, ReportStage, LinkedBCICell, MemberTableCell, CompileChainStage) but only two outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here the outgoing fan-out is small, so the class does not meet the definition."
