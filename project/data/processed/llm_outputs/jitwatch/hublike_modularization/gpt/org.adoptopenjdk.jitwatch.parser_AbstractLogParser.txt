    "justification": "AbstractLogParser has many outgoing dependencies (19 distinct collaborators such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITEvent, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.ParseUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaClass, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.TagProcessor), but it has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []). The hub-like modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; since incoming dependencies are absent, this class is not a hub."
