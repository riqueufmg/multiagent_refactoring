    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.OSUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "OSUtil has a small number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Incoming dependencies: DisassemblyUtil and JITWatchUI (2 classes). Outgoing dependencies: OSUtil.OperatingSystem and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.Architecture (2 direct classes); Architecture in turn depends on StringUtil (one additional transitive reference). The total direct coupling is low (2 in, 2 out), so OSUtil does not exhibit hub-like modularization despite JITWatchUI depending on many other classes."
