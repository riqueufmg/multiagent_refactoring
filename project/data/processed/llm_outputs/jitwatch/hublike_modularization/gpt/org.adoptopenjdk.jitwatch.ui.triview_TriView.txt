    "detection": true,
    "justification": "TriView has a large number of outgoing dependencies (28 distinct classes) spanning many subsystems (model: IMetaMember, Compilation, MetaClass, MemberSignatureParts; bytecode: MemberBytecode, ClassBC, LineTable, BytecodeInstruction; UI/viewers: ViewerSource, ViewerBytecode, ViewerAssembly, TriViewPane, TriViewNavigationStack, ClassSearch; util/core/loader: UserInterfaceUtil, JITWatchConfig, ResourceLoader; and others). It also has multiple incoming dependents (4 distinct classes) including core UI entry points and related view components (JITWatchUI, TriViewPane, TriViewNavigationStack, ClassSearch). The combination of many outgoing connections to diverse components and several incoming references from central UI classes indicates TriView acts as a hub-like abstraction."
