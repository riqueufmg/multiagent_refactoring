    "justification": "RuntimeScala has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager). Hub-like Modularization is characterized by an abstraction having many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the number of distinct connections is low (2), so the smell is not detected. Note: although LanguageManager's dependency list is large, that reflects LanguageManager's connections, not many incoming/outgoing ties specifically to RuntimeScala."
