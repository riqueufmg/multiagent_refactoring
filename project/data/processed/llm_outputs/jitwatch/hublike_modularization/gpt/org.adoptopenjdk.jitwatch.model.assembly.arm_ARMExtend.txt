    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm.ARMExtend",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ARMExtend has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly.ViewerAssembly). Although ViewerAssembly depends on many types (including ARMExtend), the ARMExtend class itself does not have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions (incoming count = 1, outgoing count = 0), so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
