    "justification": "HotThrowResult has only one outgoing dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember, and only one incoming dependent class: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow.HotThrowFinder. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the counts here (outgoing=1, incoming=1) are low, so this class is not a hub."
