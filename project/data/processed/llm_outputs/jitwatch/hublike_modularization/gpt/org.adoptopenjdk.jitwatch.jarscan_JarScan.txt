    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JarScan has a large number of outgoing dependencies (12 distinct dependencies, e.g. FreqInlineSizeOperation, SequenceCountOperation, NextInstructionOperation, SequenceSearchOperation, InstructionCountOperation, IJarScanOperation, MethodLengthOperation, AllocationCountOperation, InvokeCountOperation, ClassBC, BytecodeLoader, MethodSizeHistoOperation) but has 0 incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; because there are no incoming dependencies, JarScan does not meet the definition of a hub in this analysis."
