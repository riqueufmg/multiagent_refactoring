    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.LineTableEntry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. LineTableEntry has no outgoing dependencies (empty list) and only four incoming references: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.BytecodeLoader, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.LineTable, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView. Because it lacks outgoing dependencies and has a small number of incoming dependents, it does not meet the hub-like criteria. (Note: some incoming classes themselves depend on many types, but that does not make LineTableEntry a hub.)"
