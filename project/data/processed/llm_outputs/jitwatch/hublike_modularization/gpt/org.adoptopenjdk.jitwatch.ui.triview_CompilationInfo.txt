    "justification": "CompilationInfo has a small number of direct dependencies: 2 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil) and 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; the provided data shows only a few links, so this class is not a hub."
