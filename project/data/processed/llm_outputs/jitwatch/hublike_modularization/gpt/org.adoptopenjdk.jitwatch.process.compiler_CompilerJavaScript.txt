    "justification": "CompilerJavaScript has only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager) and 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows a low in-degree and out-degree, so this class is not a hub."
