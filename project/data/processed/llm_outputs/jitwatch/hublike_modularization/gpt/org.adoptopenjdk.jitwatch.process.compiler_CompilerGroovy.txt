    "justification": "CompilerGroovy has 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener) and 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; the counts here are low (incoming=1, outgoing=1), so this is not a hub-like module."
