    "justification": "AllocationCountOperation has only 3 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.allocationcount.InstructionAllocCountMap, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows small numbers on both sides, so the smell is not detected."
