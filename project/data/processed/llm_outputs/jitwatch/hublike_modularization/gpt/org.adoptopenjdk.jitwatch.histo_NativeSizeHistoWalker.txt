    "justification": "NativeSizeHistoWalker has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the two outgoing dependency classes themselves reference many types, those are not direct dependencies of NativeSizeHistoWalker; considering the class in isolation, it does not exhibit hub-like characteristics."
