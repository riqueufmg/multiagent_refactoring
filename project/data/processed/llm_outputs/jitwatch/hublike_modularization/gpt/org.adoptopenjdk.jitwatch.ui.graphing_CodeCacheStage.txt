    "justification": "CodeCacheStage has a small number of direct relationships: 4 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Tag, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.CodeCacheEvent, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil) and 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI). Although JITWatchUI itself is highly connected, those are indirect connections; when considering CodeCacheStage in isolation (only its direct incoming/outgoing links), it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions and therefore does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
