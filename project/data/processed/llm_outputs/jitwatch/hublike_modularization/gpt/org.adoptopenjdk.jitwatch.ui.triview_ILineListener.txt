    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.ILineListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ILineListener has 4 incoming dependencies: Viewer, ViewerAssembly, ViewerBytecode, ViewerSource (all in org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview) and only 1 outgoing dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.ILineListener.LineType. The number of incoming and outgoing links is small and confined to closely related viewer classes, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization (not a large number of dependencies to many other abstractions)."
