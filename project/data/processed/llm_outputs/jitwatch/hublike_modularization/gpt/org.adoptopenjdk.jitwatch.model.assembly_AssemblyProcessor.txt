    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 9 (Architecture, MemberSignatureParts, IMetaMember, PackageManager, IAssemblyParser, AssemblyMethod, StringUtil, AssemblyUtil, MetaClass) — shows a moderate number of targets. Incoming dependencies: 2 (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.hotspot.HotSpotLogParser, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AbstractAssemblyParser) — only two clients depend on this class. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing ties; here outgoing are moderate but incoming references are minimal, so the class does not act as a hub."
