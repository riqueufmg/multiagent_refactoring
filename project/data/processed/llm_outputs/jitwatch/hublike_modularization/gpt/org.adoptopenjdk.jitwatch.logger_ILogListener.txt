    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ILogListener has a large number of incoming dependencies (18 distinct classes depend on it, e.g. org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager, multiple compiler classes such as CompilerJava/CompilerKotlin/CompilerGroovy, multiple runtime classes such as RuntimeJava/RuntimeKotlin/RuntimeGroovy, Sandbox, MainConfigStage), but it has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; since ILogListener lacks outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the defined criteria for this smell."
