    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization is not detected because the class has only one incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.ReportStage) and no outgoing dependencies. A hub would have many incoming and/or outgoing links to many other abstractions; here incoming count = 1 (ReportStage) and outgoing count = 0, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
