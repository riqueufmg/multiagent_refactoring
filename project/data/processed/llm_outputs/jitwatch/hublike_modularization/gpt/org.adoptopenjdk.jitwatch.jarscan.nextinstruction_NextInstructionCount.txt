    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction.NextInstructionCount",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode) and one incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction.NextInstructionCountList). Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are low (1 each), so the smell is not present."
