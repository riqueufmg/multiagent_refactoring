    "detection": true,
    "justification": "JITWatchUI has a large number of outgoing dependencies (46 distinct abstractions) including UI stages and core/model/parsing/util classes (examples: ReportStage, TriView, StageManager, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, ParserFactory, JITWatchConfig, MetaClass, Compilation, UserInterfaceUtil, many *Stage classes). It also has many incoming dependencies (17 distinct abstractions) where numerous other classes rely on it (examples: SandboxStage, TriView, ReportStage, CodeCacheStage, HistoStage, CompileChainStage, TextViewerStage). The class therefore has both many incoming and many outgoing ties to other abstractions, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
