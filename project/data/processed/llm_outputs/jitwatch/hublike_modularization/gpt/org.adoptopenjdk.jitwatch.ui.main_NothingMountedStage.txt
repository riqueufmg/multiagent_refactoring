    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.NothingMountedStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NothingMountedStage has 4 outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage.StageManager, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil. It has a single incoming dependency listed: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Here the incoming degree (1) and outgoing degree (4) are low, so NothingMountedStage does not meet the hub-like criteria. (While JITWatchUI itself has many dependencies, that reflects the caller's connectivity, not that NothingMountedStage has many incoming/outgoing relationships.)"
