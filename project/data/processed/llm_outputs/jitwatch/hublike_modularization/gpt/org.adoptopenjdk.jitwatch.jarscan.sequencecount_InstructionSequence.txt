    "justification": "InstructionSequence has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode) and only 2 incoming dependents (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount.SequenceCountOperation and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction.NextInstructionOperation). These small numbers of incoming and outgoing relationships do not constitute a hub-like modularization."
