    "justification": "IParserSelectedListener has a single outgoing dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.ParserType, and a single incoming dependency from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.parserchooser.ParserChooser. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the observed counts (1 incoming, 1 outgoing) are low, so this is not a hub."
