    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.methodlength.MethodLengthOperation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited (4): org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MemberSignatureParts. Incoming dependencies are minimal (1): org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections; MethodLengthOperation does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. (Related classes such as MemberBytecode or JarScan having many dependencies are noted in the input but are not counted toward MethodLengthOperation when analyzing the class in isolation.)"
