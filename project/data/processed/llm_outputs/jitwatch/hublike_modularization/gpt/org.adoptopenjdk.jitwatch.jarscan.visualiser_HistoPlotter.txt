    "justification": "HistoPlotter has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil) and 0 incoming dependencies. A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low connectivity (outgoing_count=1, incoming_count=0), so it is not a hub."
