    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IMemberSelectedListener has multiple incoming dependencies (5): TopListStage, TriView, ClassMemberList, CompilationChooser, CompileChainStage. However it has a single direct outgoing dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here outgoing dependencies are minimal (1), so the class does not meet the hub-like smell criteria."
