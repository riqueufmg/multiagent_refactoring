    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.MemberScore",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MemberScore has only one outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although IMetaMember itself depends on several classes, those are not direct incoming/outgoing dependencies of MemberScore, so the hub-like smell is not present."
