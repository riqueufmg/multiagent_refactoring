    "justification": "AbstractGraphStage is not a hub: incoming_dependencies is empty, and it has only six outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.ParseUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Tag, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize.RateLimitedResizeListener, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; here the class lacks incoming connections and does not exhibit a large number of outgoing connections, so the smell is not present."
