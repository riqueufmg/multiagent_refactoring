    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.viewer.AbstractTextViewerStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AbstractTextViewerStage has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.Viewer, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low counts for both directions. (Although the three outgoing classes themselves have many dependencies, those do not increase the direct incoming/outgoing links of AbstractTextViewerStage in the given data.)"
