    "justification": "UncommonTrap has only a single outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Tag) and a single incoming dependent class (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeAnnotationBuilder). A hub-like module would have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows low fan-in and fan-out, so the Hub-like Modularization smell is not present."
