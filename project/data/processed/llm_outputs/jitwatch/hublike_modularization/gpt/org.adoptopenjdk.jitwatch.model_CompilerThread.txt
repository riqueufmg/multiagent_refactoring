    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.CompilerThread",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CompilerThread has multiple incoming dependencies (from AbstractLogParser, ZingLogParser, Compilation, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, JITDataModel, CompilerThreadStage) but only a single outgoing dependency (to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation). Hub-like Modularization requires both numerous incoming and numerous outgoing relationships; here the outgoing degree is low, so the class is not a hub."
