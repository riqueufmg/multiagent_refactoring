    "justification": "The class has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (incoming_dependencies: 0, outgoing_dependencies: 0). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; with zero dependencies, this class does not exhibit the smell."
