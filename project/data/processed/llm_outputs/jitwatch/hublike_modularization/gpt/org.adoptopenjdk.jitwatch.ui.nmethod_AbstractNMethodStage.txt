    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. AbstractNMethodStage has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions (NMethodInfo, UserInterfaceUtil, IMetaMember, RateLimitedResizeListener, JITWatchUI, Compilation) but has 0 incoming dependencies in the provided data. Because it lacks incoming dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
