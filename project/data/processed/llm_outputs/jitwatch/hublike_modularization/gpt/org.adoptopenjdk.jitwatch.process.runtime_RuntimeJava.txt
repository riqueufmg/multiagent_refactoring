    "justification": "RuntimeJava has only one outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener) and only one incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager). Although LanguageManager depends on many classes, RuntimeJava itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub-like module."
