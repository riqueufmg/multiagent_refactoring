    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CompilerKotlin has only 2 incoming dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeKotlin) and 1 outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener). These counts indicate low fan-in and fan-out, so it does not meet the 'hub-like' condition of having many incoming and outgoing dependencies."
