    "justification": "ITreeVisitable has only one outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember) and only one incoming dependent class (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor.TreeVisitor). The number of distinct incoming and outgoing relationships is small, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization. (Note: IMetaMember itself depends on several classes, but those are not direct dependencies of ITreeVisitable.)"
