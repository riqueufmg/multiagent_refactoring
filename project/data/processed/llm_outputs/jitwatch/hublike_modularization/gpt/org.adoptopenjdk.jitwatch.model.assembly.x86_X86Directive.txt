    "justification": "X86Directive has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AbstractAssemblyParser). Although AbstractAssemblyParser depends on multiple assembly-related classes (Architecture, ARMDirective, AssemblyMethod, AssemblyInstruction, AssemblyProcessor, AssemblyLabels, AssemblyBlock, X86Directive), X86Directive itself does not have the large number of incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
