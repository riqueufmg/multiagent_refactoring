    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeKotlin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "RuntimeKotlin has 3 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerKotlin, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.ResourceLoader) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The provided data shows low counts for both directions (especially incoming), and the transitive dependencies of its outgoing targets do not increase RuntimeKotlin's direct coupling. Therefore RuntimeKotlin is not exhibiting a hub-like modularization smell."
