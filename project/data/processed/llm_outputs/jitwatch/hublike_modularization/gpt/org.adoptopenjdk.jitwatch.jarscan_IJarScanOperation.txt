    "justification": "IJarScanOperation has only one outgoing dependency (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode) and only one incoming dependent class (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan). A hub-like modularization would show many incoming and many outgoing direct dependencies; here both counts are 1, so it is not a hub. (Note: MemberBytecode itself has many dependencies, but those are not direct dependencies of IJarScanOperation.)"
