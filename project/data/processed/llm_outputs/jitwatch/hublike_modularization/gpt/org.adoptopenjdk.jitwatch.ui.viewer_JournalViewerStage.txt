    "justification": "JournalViewerStage has only 3 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.Viewer) and only 1 incoming dependency (referenced by org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; the provided data shows low counts in both incoming and outgoing directions, so the smell is not detected."
