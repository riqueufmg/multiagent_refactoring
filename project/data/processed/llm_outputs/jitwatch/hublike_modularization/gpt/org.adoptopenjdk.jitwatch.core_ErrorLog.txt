    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ErrorLog has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and/or outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; ErrorLog's dependency counts (incoming=1, outgoing=0) do not meet that criterion. Note: although JITWatchUI depends on many classes, ErrorLog itself is referenced by a single class, so it is not a hub."
