    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 4 outgoing dependencies (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Task, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.CompilationUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember) and 0 incoming dependencies. Because incoming dependencies are absent and the outgoing degree is small, this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
