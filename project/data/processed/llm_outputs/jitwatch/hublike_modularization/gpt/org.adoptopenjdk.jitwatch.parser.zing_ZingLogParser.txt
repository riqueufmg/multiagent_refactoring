    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ZingLogParser has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct abstractions (ZingLineType, ParseUtil, Tag, NumberedLine, IJITListener, ZingLine, CompilerThread) but has 0 incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies, ZingLogParser does not meet the definition of a hub."
