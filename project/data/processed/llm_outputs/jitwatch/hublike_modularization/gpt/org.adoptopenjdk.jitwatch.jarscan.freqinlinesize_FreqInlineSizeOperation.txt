    "justification": "Not detected. The class has 4 outgoing dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MemberSignatureParts, and only 1 incoming dependency: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows low counts for both directions, so this class does not exhibit a hub-like coupling pattern."
