    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes and 636 LOC, but one class (org.jsoup.safety.Safelist) alone is 399 LOC (~63% of the package LOC). Safelist also has high structural complexity (wmc=54), many methods (nom=22) and many public members (nopm=20). The next-largest class (Cleaner) is 133 LOC. The concentration of size and complexity in a single class indicates an excessively large component (God Component) within the package."
