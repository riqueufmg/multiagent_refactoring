    "justification": "The package contains 4 classes and a total of 190 LOC (class LOCs: 96, 44, 34, 16). The largest class (HtmlToPlainText) is 96 LOC with modest complexity (wmc=8). Overall class count (4) and aggregate LOC (190) are low and do not indicate an excessively large component. Coupling metrics (Ce=4, Ca=4) are moderate. Therefore the data do not support detecting a God Component."
