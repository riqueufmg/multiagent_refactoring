    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "RequestAuthenticator has multiple incoming dependencies (6 distinct callers: org.jsoup.Connection, org.jsoup.helper.AuthenticationHandler, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Request, org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthHandler, org.jsoup.helper.HttpClientExecutor) but only a single outgoing dependency (org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator.Context). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; here the outgoing fan-out is minimal, so the class is not a hub."
