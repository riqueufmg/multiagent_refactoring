    "justification": "No: UrlConnectionExecutor has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.helper.AuthenticationHandler, org.jsoup.Connection, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
