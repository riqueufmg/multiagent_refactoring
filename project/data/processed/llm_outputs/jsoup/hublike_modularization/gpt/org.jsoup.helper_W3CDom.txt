    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has 7 outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom.W3CBuilder, org.jsoup.nodes.DocumentType, org.jsoup.select.Selector, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.helper.Validate) and 1 incoming dependency (org.jsoup.nodes.NodeUtils), for a total of 8 distinct connected abstractions. An abstraction exhibiting Hub-like Modularization would have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here the number of both incoming (1) and outgoing (7) relationships is relatively small, so W3CDom does not qualify as a hub in isolation."
