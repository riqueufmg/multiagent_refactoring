    "justification": "Document.Syntax has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (org.jsoup.nodes.Document). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. Although org.jsoup.nodes.Document lists many dependencies, Document.Syntax itself is only referenced by Document and does not depend on other abstractions, so it is not a hub."
