    "justification": "While org.jsoup.helper.Regex has a large number of incoming dependencies (11 distinct clients depend on it: org.jsoup.nodes.Element; org.jsoup.helper.Re2jRegex; org.jsoup.select.Evaluator and several Evaluator inner classes such as AttributeWithValueMatching, Matches, MatchesOwn, MatchesWholeText, MatchesWholeOwnText; org.jsoup.select.QueryParser; org.jsoup.select.NodeEvaluator and NodeEvaluator.MatchesValue), its outgoing dependencies are limited (only 3: org.jsoup.helper.Re2jRegex, org.jsoup.internal.SharedConstants, org.jsoup.helper.Regex.Matcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming side is high but the outgoing side is small, so the class is not a hub-like module."
