    "justification": "SharedConstants has high incoming coupling (fan-in) from 8 distinct classes: org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes, org.jsoup.nodes.FormElement, org.jsoup.helper.RequestDispatch, org.jsoup.helper.Regex, org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder, org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder, org.jsoup.parser.TagSet. However, its outgoing dependencies list is empty (no fan-out). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; because outgoing dependencies = 0, this does not qualify as a hub-like module."
