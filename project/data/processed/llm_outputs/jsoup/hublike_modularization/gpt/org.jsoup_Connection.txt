    "justification": "The class has a large number of both outgoing and incoming dependencies. Outgoing: 8 distinct dependencies (org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.Progress, org.jsoup.Connection.Request, org.jsoup.Connection.Method, org.jsoup.Connection.KeyVal, org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator, org.jsoup.parser.Parser, org.jsoup.Connection.Response), showing it depends on many other abstractions. Incoming: 13 distinct dependents (e.g., org.jsoup.examples.HtmlToPlainText, org.jsoup.Jsoup, org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.nodes.FormElement, org.jsoup.helper.CookieUtil, org.jsoup.helper.UrlConnectionExecutor, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection and its nested types HttpConnection.Base, HttpConnection.Request, HttpConnection.Response, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.KeyVal, org.jsoup.helper.UrlBuilder, org.jsoup.helper.HttpClientExecutor) that reference this class. The combination of numerous outbound links and many inbound dependents indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
