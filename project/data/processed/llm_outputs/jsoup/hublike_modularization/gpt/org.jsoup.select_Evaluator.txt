    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Evaluator has many incoming and outgoing dependencies: 11 distinct incoming dependents (Element, Document, FormElement, DataUtil, Elements, Selector, Collector, StructuralEvaluator, QueryParser, CombiningEvaluator, StreamParser) and 5 outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.helper.Regex, org.jsoup.nodes.Node, org.jsoup.parser.ParseSettings, org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.nodes.LeafNode). The incoming set includes diverse abstractions across selection, node, parser, and helper concerns (e.g., Selector, QueryParser, Collector, Elements, StreamParser), while the outgoing set spans node types, parser settings, and helper utilities. This bidirectional connectivity with numerous, cross-cutting abstractions indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
