    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpClientExecutor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependency relationships. HttpClientExecutor has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependency targets: org.jsoup.Connection (8 listed dependencies), org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator (1 listed dependency), and org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection (12 listed dependencies). The absence of incoming dependencies and the limited number of outgoing targets mean this class is not a hub."
