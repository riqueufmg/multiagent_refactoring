    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (org.jsoup.helper.Regex). Although that outgoing dependency (Regex) itself has further dependencies, the analysis must consider the class in isolation and only its direct ties. With 0 incoming and 1 outgoing dependency, it does not meet the \"hub-like\" criteria."
