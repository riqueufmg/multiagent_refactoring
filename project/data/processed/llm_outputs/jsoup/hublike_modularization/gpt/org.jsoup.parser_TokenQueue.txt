    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TokenQueue has a small set of outgoing dependencies (3): org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader, org.jsoup.helper.Validate. It has incoming dependencies from 3 classes: org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.select.Selector, and org.jsoup.select.QueryParser. While some incoming classes (e.g., Element) themselves depend on many other abstractions, TokenQueue’s direct incoming and outgoing coupling counts are low and do not exhibit the large-number bi-directional dependency pattern required to classify it as Hub-like Modularization."
