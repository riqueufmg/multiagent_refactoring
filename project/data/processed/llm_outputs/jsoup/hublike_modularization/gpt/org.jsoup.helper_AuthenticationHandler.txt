    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.AuthenticationHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AuthenticationHandler has 4 incoming dependencies (org.jsoup.helper.UrlConnectionExecutor, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Response, org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthHandler) and 2 outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator, org.jsoup.helper.AuthenticationHandler.AuthShim), for a total of 6 distinct collaborators. The smell 'Hub-like Modularization' requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; here the incoming and outgoing counts are modest (4 and 2 respectively), so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
