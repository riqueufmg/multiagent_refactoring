    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Base",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (org.jsoup.Connection) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming_dependencies = 0 and outgoing count = 1. Although the outgoing dependency (org.jsoup.Connection) itself depends on many other abstractions, that does not make HttpConnection.Base a hub when analyzed in isolation."
