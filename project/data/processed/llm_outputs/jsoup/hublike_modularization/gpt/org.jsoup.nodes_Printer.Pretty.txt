    "justification": "Not a hub: Incoming dependency count = 0 (no classes depend on this class). Outgoing dependency count = 2 (depends only on org.jsoup.nodes.Entities and org.jsoup.parser.Tag). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies — this class does not meet that criterion."
