    "justification": "LeafNode has 6 outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.nodes.Node, org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes) and 5 incoming dependencies (org.jsoup.nodes.Printer, org.jsoup.select.Evaluator, org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator, org.jsoup.select.NodeEvaluator, org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder), for a total of 11 connected abstractions. These connections are concentrated on closely related node, parser, selector, and utility classes within the same library rather than a large/diverse set of unrelated modules, so it does not meet the criterion of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (hub-like modularization)."
