    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (org.jsoup.internal.SoftPool) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing). Given the low counts (outgoing=1, incoming=0) when analyzed in isolation, this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
