    "class": "org.jsoup.Progress",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from 4 other abstractions (org.jsoup.Connection, org.jsoup.internal.ControllableInputStream, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Request) but has 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; since Progress has no outgoing dependencies, the hub-like smell is not present."
