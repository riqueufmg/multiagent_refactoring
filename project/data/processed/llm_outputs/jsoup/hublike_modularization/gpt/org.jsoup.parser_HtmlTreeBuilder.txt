    "justification": "HtmlTreeBuilder has a large number of outgoing dependencies (18 total: Tag, Token, Document, Node, CDataNode, DataNode, ParseSettings, Element, Comment, TextNode, FormElement, HtmlTreeBuilderState, Normalizer, TokeniserState, Parser, Attributes, StringUtil, Validate) but only a small number of incoming dependencies (2 total: org.jsoup.parser.Parser, org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilderState). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many dependencies in both directions; here the outgoing side is high while the incoming side is minimal, so the class does not meet the bidirectional 'hub' condition."
