    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.CookieUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CookieUtil has outgoing dependencies to 4 distinct abstractions (org.jsoup.Connection, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming coupling is absent, so the hub smell is not present. (While some outgoing targets themselves depend on many classes, the analyzed class lacks the required high incoming coupling.)"
