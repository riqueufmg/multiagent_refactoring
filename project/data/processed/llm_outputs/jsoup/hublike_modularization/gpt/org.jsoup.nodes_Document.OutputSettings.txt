    "justification": "Document.OutputSettings has a small number of dependencies: 2 outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.nodes.Entities, org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil) and 1 incoming dependency (org.jsoup.nodes.Document). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing ties to numerous other abstractions; the provided counts and listed dependent classes do not meet that criterion."
