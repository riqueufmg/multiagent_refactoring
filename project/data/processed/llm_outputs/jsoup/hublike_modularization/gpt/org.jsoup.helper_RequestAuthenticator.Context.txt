    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator) and no outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class's dependency set is minimal (1 incoming, 0 outgoing), so the smell is not detected."
