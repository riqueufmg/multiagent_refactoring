    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.CDataNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 2 (org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable). Incoming dependencies: 3 (org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder, org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides. The provided data shows a small fan-out (2) and a small fan-in (3), so this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization. Note: several incoming classes themselves depend on many types, but that does not increase CDataNode's own incoming/outgoing dependency counts in the given scope."
