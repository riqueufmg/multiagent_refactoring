    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner.CleaningVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CleaningVisitor has a single outgoing dependency (org.jsoup.nodes.Element) and a single incoming dependency (org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner). The outgoing_dependencies list contains only Element, and the incoming_dependencies list contains only Cleaner. Although Element itself lists many dependencies, under the requirement to consider the class in isolation those are not direct dependencies of CleaningVisitor. Because the class has only one incoming and one outgoing partner, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
