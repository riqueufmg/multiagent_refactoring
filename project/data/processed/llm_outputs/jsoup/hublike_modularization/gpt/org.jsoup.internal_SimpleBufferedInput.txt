    "justification": "SimpleBufferedInput has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.internal.SoftPool, org.jsoup.helper.Validate) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.jsoup.internal.ControllableInputStream). A hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; these small counts do not meet that criterion."
