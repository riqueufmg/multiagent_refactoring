    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Request",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions (org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil, org.jsoup.Progress, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection, org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator, org.jsoup.parser.Parser, org.jsoup.Connection) but only a single incoming dependency (referenced by org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependency relationships; here the incoming degree is low (1) and the outgoing degree is moderate (6), so the class does not exhibit a hub-like coupling pattern."
