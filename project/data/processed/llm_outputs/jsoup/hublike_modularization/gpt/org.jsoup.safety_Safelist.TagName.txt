    "justification": "Not detected: Safelist.TagName has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.jsoup.safety.Safelist). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here TagName lacks outgoing links and only has a single incoming link, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
