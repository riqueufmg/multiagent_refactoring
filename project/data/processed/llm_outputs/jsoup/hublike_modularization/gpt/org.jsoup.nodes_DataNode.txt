    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.DataNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DataNode has a low number of connections: 3 incoming dependents (org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder, org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder) and 2 outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable). The total set of distinct related abstractions is small (5 classes). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; DataNode's low coupling does not meet that criterion, so the smell is not detected."
