    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.SoftPool",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SoftPool has incoming dependencies from 5 distinct classes (org.jsoup.internal.SimpleBufferedInput, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator, org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator.Has, org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader) but has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; because SoftPool has zero outgoing dependencies, it does not satisfy the hub-like smell."
