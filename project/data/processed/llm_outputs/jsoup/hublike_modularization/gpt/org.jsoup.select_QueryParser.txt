    "justification": "QueryParser has many outgoing dependencies (10): org.jsoup.select.NodeEvaluator, org.jsoup.helper.Regex, org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator, org.jsoup.select.CombiningEvaluator, org.jsoup.select.Evaluator, org.jsoup.select.Selector, org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue. However, it has only a single incoming dependency listed (from org.jsoup.select.Selector). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here only the outgoing side is large while the incoming side is minimal, so it is not a hub."
