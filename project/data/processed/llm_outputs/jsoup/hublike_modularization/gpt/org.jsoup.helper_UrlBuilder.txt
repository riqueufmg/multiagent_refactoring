    "justification": "UrlBuilder has outgoing dependencies to 3 other abstractions: org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, and org.jsoup.Connection, but it has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; UrlBuilder lacks incoming links, so it is not a hub."
