    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 3 outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.Jsoup, org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.select.Elements) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; Wikipedia lacks incoming dependencies and has a small number of outgoing links, so the smell is not present."
