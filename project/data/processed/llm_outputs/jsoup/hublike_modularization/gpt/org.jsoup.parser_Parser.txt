    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Parser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Parser class has a high number of both incoming and outgoing relations: 10 outgoing dependencies (HtmlTreeBuilder, Document, Tokeniser, TreeBuilder, XmlTreeBuilder, ParseSettings, Element, TagSet, ParseErrorList, Validate) and 16 incoming dependents (including Jsoup, Connection, Cleaner, Element, Document, NodeUtils, Entities, Comment, HttpConnection, HttpConnection.Request, DataUtil, StreamParser, HtmlTreeBuilderState, TreeBuilder, HtmlTreeBuilder, XmlTreeBuilder). In total it interacts with 21 distinct other abstractions. Several of its outgoing dependencies (HtmlTreeBuilder, TreeBuilder, Tokeniser, XmlTreeBuilder) also list Parser as a dependency, showing reciprocal coupling. The combination of many incoming and outgoing links to a wide set of classes (core parsing, I/O/helpers, DOM types, and higher-level entry points like Jsoup/Connection) matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
