    "justification": "Token.Comment has only 1 incoming dependency (org.jsoup.parser.Token) and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (org.jsoup.parser.TokenData). Although TokenData depends on org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, Token.Comment's direct dependency set is minimal. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (not many incoming and outgoing connections)."
