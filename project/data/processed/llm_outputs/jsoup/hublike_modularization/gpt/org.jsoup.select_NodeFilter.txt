    "justification": "NodeFilter has a small set of collaborators rather than a large number: outgoing dependencies to 3 types (org.jsoup.select.NodeFilter.FilterResult, org.jsoup.nodes.Node, org.jsoup.select.NodeTraversor) and incoming dependencies from 4 types (org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.nodes.Node, org.jsoup.select.Elements, org.jsoup.select.NodeTraversor). Many dependencies overlap (Node and NodeTraversor appear both incoming and outgoing), yielding only 5 unique connected abstractions. This limited, mostly package-local connectivity does not constitute hub-like modularization."
