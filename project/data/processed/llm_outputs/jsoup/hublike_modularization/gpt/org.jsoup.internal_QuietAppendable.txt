    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "QuietAppendable has many incoming dependencies (14 distinct classes depend on it, e.g. org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.nodes.Node, org.jsoup.nodes.TextNode, org.jsoup.nodes.Printer, org.jsoup.nodes.Entities, org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes), but it has zero outgoing dependencies (no listed dependencies). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; because outgoing dependencies are absent, the criterion is not met."
