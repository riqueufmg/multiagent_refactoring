    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "HttpConnection has a large number of both outgoing and incoming dependencies: 11 outgoing dependencies (Document, AuthenticationHandler, ControllableInputStream, Progress, DataUtil, HttpConnection.Response, Connection, RequestAuthenticator, RequestExecutor, HttpConnection.Request, Parser, Validate) and 7 incoming dependents (Jsoup, FormElement, CookieUtil, UrlConnectionExecutor, HttpConnection.Request, HttpConnection.Response, HttpClientExecutor). Several dependencies are reciprocated (HttpConnection.Request and HttpConnection.Response appear in both incoming and outgoing lists), and core utility/connection classes (DataUtil, AuthenticationHandler, RequestAuthenticator, RequestExecutor, ControllableInputStream, Connection, Parser, Validate, Progress, Document) show cross-package coupling. The number and bidirectional nature of these ties indicate the class functions as a hub-like abstraction."
