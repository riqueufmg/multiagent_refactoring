    "justification": "RequestDispatch has only two outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.internal.SharedConstants, org.jsoup.helper.RequestExecutor) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections to many other abstractions; this class shows a low number of connections and no incoming links, so it is not a hub."
