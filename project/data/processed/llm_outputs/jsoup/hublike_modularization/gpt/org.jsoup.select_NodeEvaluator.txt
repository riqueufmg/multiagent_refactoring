    "justification": "NodeEvaluator has a small number of outgoing dependencies (4: org.jsoup.nodes.LeafNode, org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.helper.Regex, org.jsoup.nodes.Node) and only one incoming dependency (1: org.jsoup.select.QueryParser). Because it does not exhibit dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions, it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
