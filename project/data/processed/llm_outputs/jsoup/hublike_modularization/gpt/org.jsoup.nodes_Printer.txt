    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Printer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Printer has 9 outgoing dependencies (Entities, Tag, Node, Element, TextNode, LeafNode, QuietAppendable, NodeUtils, StringUtil) but only 2 incoming dependencies (org.jsoup.nodes.Element and org.jsoup.nodes.Node). Hub-like modularization requires high fan-in and fan-out; here outgoing is moderate but incoming coupling is low, so the class is not a hub."
