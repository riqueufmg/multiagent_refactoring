    "class": "org.jsoup.select.NodeTraversor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NodeTraversor has outgoing dependencies to 5 abstractions: org.jsoup.select.NodeVisitor, org.jsoup.nodes.Node, org.jsoup.select.Elements, org.jsoup.select.NodeFilter, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, and incoming dependencies from 2 abstractions: org.jsoup.select.NodeVisitor and org.jsoup.select.NodeFilter. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided counts (5 outgoing, 2 incoming) are not large and thus do not meet the definition. Note: there are bidirectional links with NodeVisitor and NodeFilter, but the overall incoming/outgoing spread is insufficient to classify NodeTraversor as a hub."
