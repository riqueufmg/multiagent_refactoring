    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Collector",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Collector has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions: org.jsoup.select.Nodes, org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.select.Evaluator, org.jsoup.select.Elements, and incoming dependencies from 2 abstractions: org.jsoup.nodes.Element and org.jsoup.select.Selector. The total number of distinct incoming/outgoing partners is small (4 outgoing, 2 incoming; Element appears in both sets), so Collector does not exhibit hub-like modularization (not connected to a large number of other abstractions)."
