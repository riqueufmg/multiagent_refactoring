    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Node",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Incoming: 18 distinct classes depend on Node (NodeIterator, LeafNode, Range, Element, Document, NodeUtils, FormElement, Printer, DataUtil, Elements, NodeVisitor, NodeFilter, Evaluator, NodeTraversor, StructuralEvaluator, NodeEvaluator, TreeBuilder, HtmlTreeBuilder). Outgoing: Node depends on 12 distinct classes (Document, NodeVisitor, Printer, ParseSettings, Element, Range, NodeFilter, QuietAppendable, NodeUtils, StringUtil, Validate, Attributes). Because Node has many incoming and many outgoing links with numerous other abstractions, it exhibits the Hub-like Modularization smell."
