    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (org.jsoup.Connection) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Given the low outgoing count (1) and no incoming dependencies, this class does not meet the criteria for a hub."
