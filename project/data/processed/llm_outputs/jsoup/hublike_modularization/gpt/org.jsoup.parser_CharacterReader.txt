    "detection": true,
    "justification": "CharacterReader has a high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies: 5 outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.internal.SoftPool, org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader.CharPredicate, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.parser.TokeniserState) and 7 incoming dependents (org.jsoup.nodes.Entities, org.jsoup.helper.CookieUtil, org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser, org.jsoup.parser.TokeniserState, org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder, org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue, org.jsoup.parser.ParseError). In total it is directly connected to 11 distinct other abstractions. Notably, there is a bidirectional dependency with org.jsoup.parser.TokeniserState (appears in both incoming and outgoing lists), indicating tight coupling. The combination of many incoming clients and several outgoing dependencies (including a mutual dependency) matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
