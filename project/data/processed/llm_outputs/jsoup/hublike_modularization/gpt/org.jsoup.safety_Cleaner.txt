    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Cleaner has a relatively high number of outgoing dependencies (9 distinct abstractions: org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.parser.ParseErrorList, org.jsoup.safety.Safelist, org.jsoup.parser.Parser, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes, org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner.ElementMeta, org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner.CleaningVisitor), but only a single incoming dependency (org.jsoup.Jsoup). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Because Cleaner has only one incoming dependency, it does not meet the criterion of having large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
