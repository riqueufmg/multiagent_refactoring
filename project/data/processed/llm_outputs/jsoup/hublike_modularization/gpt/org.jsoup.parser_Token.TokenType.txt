    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []) and only a single incoming depender (org.jsoup.parser.Token). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here incoming count = 1 (Token references Token.TokenType in its dependency list) and outgoing count = 0, so the criteria are not met."
