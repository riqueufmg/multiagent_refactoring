    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.Validate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although org.jsoup.helper.Validate has a large number of incoming dependencies (38 different classes depend on it — e.g. org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.parser.Parser, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection, org.jsoup.select.Selector, org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes, org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil, etc.), it has zero outgoing dependencies (no listed outgoing dependencies). The defined smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies in both directions with many other abstractions; here only incoming coupling is high while outgoing coupling is absent, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization definition."
