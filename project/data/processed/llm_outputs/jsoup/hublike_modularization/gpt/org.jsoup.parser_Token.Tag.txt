    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token.Tag",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Token.Tag has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions: org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser, org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder, org.jsoup.parser.TokenData, org.jsoup.nodes.Range, org.jsoup.parser.TokeniserState, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes (per analyzed_package.dependencies). Incoming dependencies are empty (incoming_dependencies: []). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; because Token.Tag has no incoming dependencies, it does not meet the definition and thus is not a hub."
