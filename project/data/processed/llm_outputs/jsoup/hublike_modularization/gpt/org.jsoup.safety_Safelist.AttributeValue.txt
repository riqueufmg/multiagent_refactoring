    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Safelist.AttributeValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has a single incoming dependency (from org.jsoup.safety.Safelist). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Although org.jsoup.safety.Safelist itself depends on many types (org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute, org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.safety.Safelist.TagName, org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer, org.jsoup.safety.Safelist.Protocol, org.jsoup.safety.Safelist.AttributeValue, org.jsoup.safety.Safelist.AttributeKey, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes), Safelist.AttributeValue itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies."
