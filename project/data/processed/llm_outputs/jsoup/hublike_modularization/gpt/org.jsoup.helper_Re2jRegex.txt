    "justification": "Re2jRegex has a single outgoing dependency: org.jsoup.helper.Regex, and a single incoming dependency from org.jsoup.helper.Regex (per provided incoming/outgoing lists). Distinct incoming = 1 and distinct outgoing = 1. Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the counts here are minimal, so the smell is not detected."
