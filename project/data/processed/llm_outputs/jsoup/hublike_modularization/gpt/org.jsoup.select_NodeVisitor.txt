    "class": "org.jsoup.select.NodeVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NodeVisitor has low outgoing coupling (2 outgoing dependencies: org.jsoup.nodes.Node, org.jsoup.select.NodeTraversor) and a moderate number of incoming references (5 distinct incoming classes: org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.nodes.Node, org.jsoup.select.Elements, org.jsoup.select.NodeTraversor, org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires both high fan-out and high fan-in (dependencies with a large number of other abstractions). Because NodeVisitor's outgoing dependency count is small and the incoming count is not unusually large, it does not meet the criteria for a hub."
