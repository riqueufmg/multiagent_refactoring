    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.PseudoTextElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PseudoTextElement has 0 incoming dependencies and only 4 direct outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.parser.Tag, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes, org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections. Given the absence of incoming links and the small number of direct outgoing links, there is no evidence of a hub-like modularization for this class when analyzed in isolation."
