    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.jsoup.Connection) in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion based on the given, isolated metrics. Note: the fact that org.jsoup.Connection itself depends on many classes does not increase org.jsoup.Connection.Response's direct incoming/outgoing counts in the provided data."
