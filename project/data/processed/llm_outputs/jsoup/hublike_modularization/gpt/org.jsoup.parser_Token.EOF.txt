    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (to org.jsoup.parser.Token). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows no incoming dependencies and a single outgoing dependency. Although org.jsoup.parser.Token (the single outgoing target) has many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing relations of org.jsoup.parser.Token.EOF in the provided data."
