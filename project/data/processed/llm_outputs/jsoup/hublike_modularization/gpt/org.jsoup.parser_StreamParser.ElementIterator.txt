    "justification": "StreamParser.ElementIterator has only one outgoing dependency (org.jsoup.nodes.Element) and a single incoming dependency (org.jsoup.parser.StreamParser). Both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are low, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization. (Although org.jsoup.nodes.Element itself depends on many classes, those are not direct dependencies of ElementIterator and do not make ElementIterator a hub in isolation.)"
