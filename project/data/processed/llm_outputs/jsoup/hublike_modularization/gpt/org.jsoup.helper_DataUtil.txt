    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "DataUtil has many outgoing and incoming dependencies, indicating a hub. Outgoing: 13 distinct abstractions (Document, Node, DataUtil.CharsetDoc, ControllableInputStream, Elements, XmlDeclaration, StreamParser, Comment, Evaluator, Normalizer, StringUtil, Parser, Validate, SimpleStreamReader). Incoming: 7 distinct abstractions depend on it (Jsoup, Document, Document.OutputSettings, Entities, HttpConnection, HttpConnection.Request, HttpConnection.Response). The class therefore both depends on and is depended upon by numerous unrelated modules (parser, nodes, internal utilities, networking helpers), which matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
