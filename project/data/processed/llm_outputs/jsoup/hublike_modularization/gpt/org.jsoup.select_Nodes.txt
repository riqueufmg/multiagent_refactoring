    "justification": "Hub-like modularization is characterized by an abstraction having dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. org.jsoup.select.Nodes has 2 outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.helper.Validate) and is referenced by 2 incoming classes (org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.select.Collector). These small counts of incoming and outgoing relationships do not constitute a hub-like module, so the smell is not detected."
