    "justification": "FormElement has a relatively large set of outgoing dependencies (12: org.jsoup.parser.Tag, org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.nodes.Node, org.jsoup.select.Elements, org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.internal.SharedConstants, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection, org.jsoup.select.Evaluator, org.jsoup.Jsoup, org.jsoup.Connection, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes, org.jsoup.helper.Validate) but only 2 incoming dependencies in the provided data (org.jsoup.nodes.Document and org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder). Hub-like modularization requires having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; here only the outgoing side is large while the incoming side is small, so the smell is not detected."
