    "justification": "ControllableInputStream has a small number of incoming and outgoing connections: incoming from 3 classes (org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Response, org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil) and outgoing to 3 classes (org.jsoup.Progress, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.internal.SimpleBufferedInput). There is no evidence in the provided data of dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (counts are low), so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
