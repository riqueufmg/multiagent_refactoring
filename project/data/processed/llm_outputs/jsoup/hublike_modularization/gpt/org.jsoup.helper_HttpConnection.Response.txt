Incoming dependencies (1): org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependency relationships. While HttpConnection.Response has multiple outgoing dependencies (6), it has only a single incoming dependency (HttpConnection), so it does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
