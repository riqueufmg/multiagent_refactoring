    "justification": "CharsetDoc has only one outgoing dependency (org.jsoup.nodes.Document) and only one incoming dependency (org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil). The provided data shows that Document and DataUtil have many dependencies themselves, but those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of CharsetDoc. Because CharsetDoc does not have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, the Hub-like Modularization smell is not detected."
