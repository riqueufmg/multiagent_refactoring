    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.jsoup.examples.HtmlToPlainText). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Here the incoming count is low (1) and outgoing count is zero, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
