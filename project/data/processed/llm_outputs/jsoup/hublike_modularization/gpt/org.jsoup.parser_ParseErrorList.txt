    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.ParseErrorList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ParseErrorList has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has incoming dependencies from four classes: org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner, org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser, org.jsoup.parser.Parser, and org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; ParseErrorList has no outgoing links and only a small number (4) of incoming links, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
