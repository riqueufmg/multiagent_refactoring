    "justification": "RequestExecutor has 0 outgoing dependencies and 3 incoming dependencies (org.jsoup.helper.RequestDispatch, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Response). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here outgoing degree is zero and incoming degree is small, so the hub-like smell is not present."
