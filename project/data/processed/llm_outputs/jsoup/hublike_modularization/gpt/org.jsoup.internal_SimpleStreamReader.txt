    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.SimpleStreamReader",

    "justification": "Not detected: SimpleStreamReader has only 1 incoming dependency (from org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil) and 1 outgoing dependency (to org.jsoup.helper.Validate). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the dependency counts here are low, so the class is not a hub."
