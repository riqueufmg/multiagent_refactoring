    "justification": "AttributeRange has only a single outgoing dependency: org.jsoup.nodes.Range, and a single incoming dependency from org.jsoup.nodes.Range. Both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are 1 (limited to one other abstraction), so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization which requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions."
