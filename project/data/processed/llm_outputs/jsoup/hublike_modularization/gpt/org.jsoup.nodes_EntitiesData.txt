    "detection": false,
    "justification": "EntitiesData has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (org.jsoup.nodes.Entities, org.jsoup.nodes.Entities.EscapeMode). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided metrics show neither a large incoming set nor any outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not present."
