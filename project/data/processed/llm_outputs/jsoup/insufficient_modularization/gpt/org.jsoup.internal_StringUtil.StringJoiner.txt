    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=42), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0) mean there is little behavior to decompose; only 3 fields (nof=3) and cohesion metric not problematic (lcom=-1.0). No incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) also show the class is simple and self-contained, so further decomposition is not warranted."
