    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Elements",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=557), high implementation complexity (wmc=98), and a large number of methods (nom=60) with many public methods (nopm=58). These metrics indicate the class likely carries multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity. The class also depends on multiple types (org.jsoup.select.Selector, org.jsoup.select.Evaluator, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.nodes.Node, org.jsoup.select.NodeVisitor, org.jsoup.select.NodeFilter, org.jsoup.nodes.Element), which supports the likelihood of varied responsibilities. Taken together (high LOC, high WMC, high nom/nopm, multiple dependencies) the data justifies detecting Insufficient Modularization."
