    "justification": "Class is small and trivial: LOC=16, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), low complexity (WMC=0), no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion issues due to lack of members. These metrics show the class is already minimal; further decomposition is not warranted."
