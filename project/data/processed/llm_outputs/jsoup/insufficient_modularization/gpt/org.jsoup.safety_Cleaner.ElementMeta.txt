    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=8, nof=2 fields, nom=0 methods, wmc=0 indicating no implementation complexity; cohesion metric empty/neutral (lcom=-1.0) but with no methods there is no evidence of low cohesion; coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single dependency on org.jsoup.nodes.Element; overall size and complexity do not indicate a need for further decomposition."
