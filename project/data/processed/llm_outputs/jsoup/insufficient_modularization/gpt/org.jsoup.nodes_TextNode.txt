    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an unduly large or overly complex class that requires further decomposition. LOC = 92 and WMC = 15 are moderate, NOM = 14 (NOPM = 10) shows a modest number of methods/public API but not extreme size. LCOM = -1.0 indicates high cohesion, suggesting methods share common state and responsibility. Fanout = 0 and a small set of external dependencies reduce the likelihood that responsibilities are mixed across modules. Based on these values taken in isolation, there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
