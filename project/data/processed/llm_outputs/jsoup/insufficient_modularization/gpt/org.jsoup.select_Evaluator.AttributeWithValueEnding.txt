    "justification": "The class shows no evidence of being under-modularized: very small size (loc=17), no fields (nof=0) and no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metrics are not applicable. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no indication that further decomposition is needed."
