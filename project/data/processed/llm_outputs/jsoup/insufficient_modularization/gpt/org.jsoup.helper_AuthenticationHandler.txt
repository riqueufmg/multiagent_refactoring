    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not overly complex: LOC=63, NOM=3, WMC=6 and NOF=5 indicate limited size and moderate complexity. LCOM=0.6667 shows only a moderate cohesion concern but not strong evidence that the class is doing multiple unrelated responsibilities. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating low coupling and limited interaction surface. Given the small method count and overall compact size, there is insufficient evidence that further decomposition would meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
