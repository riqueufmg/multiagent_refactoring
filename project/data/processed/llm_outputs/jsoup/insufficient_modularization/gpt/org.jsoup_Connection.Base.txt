    "justification": "The class has a high size (loc = 119) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and no fields (nof = 0), indicating substantial code/content that is not decomposed into smaller members. Cohesion metric is undefined/negative (lcom = -1.0) and the class is isolated (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), which together suggest the class has not been modularized and could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
