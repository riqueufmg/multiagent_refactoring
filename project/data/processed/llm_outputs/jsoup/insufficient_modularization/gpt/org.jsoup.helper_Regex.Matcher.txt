    "justification": "Class has extremely small size and complexity (loc=3, wmc=0), no methods or fields (nom=0, nof=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and an LCOM value indicating no internal members (-1.0). Given its minimal lines, zero complexity and lack of members, there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further; it is already minimal and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
