    "justification": "Metrics show the class is very small and not complex: LOC=22, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0. Coupling is nil (fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies). DIT=2 alone does not indicate excessive internal responsibility, and LCOM value does not indicate a large cohesive body to split. Given the lack of methods, fields, complexity, and dependencies, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
