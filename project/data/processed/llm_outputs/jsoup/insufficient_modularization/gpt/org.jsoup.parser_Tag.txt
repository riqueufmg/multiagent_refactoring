    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 307), high method count (nom = 32, nopm = 28 public methods), many fields (nof = 14), and elevated implementation complexity (wmc = 39). These factors indicate the class is large and functionally rich such that further decomposition could reduce size and complexity. (Note: LCOM = 0.0625 indicates high cohesion, but cohesion does not negate the class's substantial size and complexity which motivate decomposition.)"
