    "justification": "The class is small and shows no signs of needing further decomposition: loc=13, nof=3 fields, nom=0 methods, wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), and LCOM=-1.0 (indicating cohesion). With zero methods and very low size/complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
