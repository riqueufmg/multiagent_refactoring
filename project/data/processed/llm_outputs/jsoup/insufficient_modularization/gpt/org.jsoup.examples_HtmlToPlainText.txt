    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small-to-moderate size (LOC=96), low complexity (WMC=8), few methods (nom=3) and fields (nof=5), and very high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0) despite listed external dependencies. Given the class-level metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is excessively large or complex and therefore no smell of Insufficient Modularization."
