    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows evidence of being too large and complex to remain a single module: LOC = 533, NOM = 57, WMC = 130, NOF = 21. These absolute sizes and high cyclomatic complexity indicate multiple responsibilities or large implementation detail that could be split. The listed dependencies (org.jsoup.parser.TokeniserState, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.internal.SoftPool, CharacterReader.CharPredicate, org.jsoup.helper.Validate) suggest varied responsibilities (buffer/character handling, utilities, pooling, predicate support, validation). Although LCOM = 0.0526 indicates the class is cohesive, the sheer number of methods, fields, and high complexity justify decomposing the class into smaller, more focused modules (e.g., buffer management, scanning/matching utilities, predicate handling) to reduce size and implementation complexity."
