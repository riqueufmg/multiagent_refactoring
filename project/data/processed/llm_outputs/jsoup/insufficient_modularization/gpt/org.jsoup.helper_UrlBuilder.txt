    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.UrlBuilder",

    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC is small (73), number of methods is low (6), and number of fields is small (3), so the class is not large. Although WMC is moderate (16), LCOM is 0.0 (high cohesion), meaning methods are related and responsibilities are not scattered. Given the small size and high cohesion, there is no clear evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
