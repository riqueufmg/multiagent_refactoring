    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC 26, NOM 4, WMC 6 indicate low size and moderate complexity. No fields (NOF 0, NOPF 0) and low coupling (fanin 0, fanout 0). Cohesion appears high (LCOM -1.0). Given these metrics taken in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or requires further decomposition."
