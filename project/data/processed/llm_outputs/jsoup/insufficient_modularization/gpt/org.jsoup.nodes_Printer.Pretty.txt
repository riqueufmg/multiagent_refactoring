    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Printer.Pretty",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 113 LOC (loc=113) but defines no methods (nom=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2), which indicates a relatively large implementation surface with little modularization into methods. WMC=0 while LOC is high suggests concentrated implementation rather than decomposed behavior. DIT=2 shows inheritance depth but no supporting methods to distribute responsibilities. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 indicate the class is not factored into smaller, reusable components. These elements together (high LOC with no methods/low field count and no coupling indicators) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and could benefit from further decomposition."
