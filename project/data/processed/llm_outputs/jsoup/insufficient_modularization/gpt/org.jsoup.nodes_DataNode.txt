    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=46) and few methods (nom=6, nopm=5) limit opportunities for further decomposition; moderate cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC=9) is not excessive; cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0) which argues against splitting; coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, only two listed dependencies). DIT=2 is reasonable. Based on these elements taken in isolation, the class does not show the typical symptoms of insufficient modularization."
