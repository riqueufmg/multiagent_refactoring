    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC = 133 (moderate size), WMC = 10 (moderate complexity), NOM = 6 with NOPM = 4 (small number of methods/public API), LCOM = 0.0 (high cohesion). No extreme fanin/fanout or deep inheritance (DIT = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Although the class has 6 fields and references inner types (CleaningVisitor, ElementMeta), the size and cohesion metrics suggest the class is reasonably focused and not a clear candidate for further decomposition."
