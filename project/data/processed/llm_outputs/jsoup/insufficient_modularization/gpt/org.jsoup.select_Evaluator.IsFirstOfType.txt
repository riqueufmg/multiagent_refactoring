    "justification": "The class is very small (loc=8) with no methods (nom=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. LCOM value (-1.0) does not indicate cohesion problems. Given its minimal size and lack of internal complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition (insufficient modularization) is needed."
