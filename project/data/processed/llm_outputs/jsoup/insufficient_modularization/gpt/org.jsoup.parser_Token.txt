    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size and complexity: LOC=397, WMC=20. High number of members: nof=28 fields and nom=20 methods. Moderate/low cohesion: LCOM=0.5, indicating the class groups responsibilities that are not tightly cohesive. Multiple internal variants/nested types are present (Token.XmlDecl, TokenData, Token.Doctype, Token.StartTag, Token.EndTag, Token.Comment, Token.Character) suggesting the class models several token kinds inside one type. Broad coupling: dependencies include Tokeniser, TokeniserState, TreeBuilder, Attributes, Range and several Token.* inner types. Together these metrics and the presence of many nested token types indicate the class is insufficiently modular and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
