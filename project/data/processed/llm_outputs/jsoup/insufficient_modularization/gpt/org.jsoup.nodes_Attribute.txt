    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Indicators show the class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: large size (LOC = 272), high implementation complexity (WMC = 53), large API/behavior surface (NOM = 30, NOPM = 19). The class depends on many distinct concerns (org.jsoup.nodes.Range, org.jsoup.nodes.Entities, org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer, org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes, org.jsoup.internal.SharedConstants, org.jsoup.helper.Validate), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities (normalization, serialization/appendable output, entity handling, validation, attribute container interactions). Although LCOM is low (0.133) indicating decent internal cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high WMC, many methods and diverse dependencies indicates the implementation could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
