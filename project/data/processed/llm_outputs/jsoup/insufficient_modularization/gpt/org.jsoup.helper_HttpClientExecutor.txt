    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpClientExecutor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate insufficient modularization: the class is relatively large (LOC=132) and fairly complex (WMC=21) while having only 7 methods (NOM=7) and just 1 public method (NOPM=1), which means much behavior is implemented in non-public methods that could be extracted. Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.4286) rather than high, suggesting multiple responsibilities or separable concerns. Additionally, fanin=0 and fanout=0 imply the class is self-contained and not delegating, and DIT=1 means no deeper inheritance is used to distribute behavior. These elements together justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
