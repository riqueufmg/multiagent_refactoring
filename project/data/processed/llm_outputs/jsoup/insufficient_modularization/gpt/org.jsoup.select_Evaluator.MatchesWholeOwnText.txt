    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: loc=23, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no cyclomatic complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has a single external dependency (org.jsoup.helper.Regex). DIT=1 and LCOM=-1.0 do not indicate low cohesion or multiple responsibilities. These metrics do not justify Insufficient Modularization."
