    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=70, WMC=11, NOM=8 (NOPM=5), NOF=4. LCOM=0.25 indicates high cohesion. Low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=0) imply limited responsibility spread. These metrics do not suggest the class is insufficiently modularized or in need of further decomposition."
