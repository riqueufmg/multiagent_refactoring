    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class is very large and complex: LOC=1021, NOM=48, NOF=56, WMC=58, NOPM=44 (large public surface). Shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and many responsibilities indicated by dependencies and nested types (org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Response, .Request, RequestExecutor, AuthenticationHandler, RequestAuthenticator, DataUtil, Parser, Document) suggest the class aggregates multiple concerns (request building, execution, response handling, authentication, parsing helpers). These metrics (high LOC, high method and field counts, high complexity, large public API) indicate the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
