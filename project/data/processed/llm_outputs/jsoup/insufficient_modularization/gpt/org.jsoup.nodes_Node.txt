    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Node",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (LOC = 766) and very high complexity (WMC = 139) together with a large number of methods (NOM = 79, of which 59 are public) indicate multiple responsibilities and a large public API surface. It has few fields (NOF = 4) so behavior is concentrated in one class rather than distributed, and DIT = 0 means no inheritance decomposition is used. The class also depends on many collaborators (13 dependencies listed), suggesting varied duties. Although LCOM = 0.2278 shows reasonable cohesion, the combination of very high LOC/WMC and large NOM/public API supports that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
