    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=23, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=2. Cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) does not indicate lack of cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single external dependency (org.jsoup.helper.Regex). Given the low size, zero/very low complexity and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
