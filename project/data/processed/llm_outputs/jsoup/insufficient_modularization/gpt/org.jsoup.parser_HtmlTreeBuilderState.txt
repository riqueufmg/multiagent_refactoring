    "justification": "Indicators show Insufficient Modularization: very large size (LOC = 1735), extremely high complexity (WMC = 473), many methods (nom = 45) and many fields (nof = 41). Cohesion is only moderate (LCOM ≈ 0.489), suggesting the class groups multiple responsibilities rather than a single focused purpose. Depth of inheritance is 0 (dit = 0) and there are no children (nc = 0), so the class is not decomposed via subclassing. The class also references a broad set of different types (dependencies list), which implies it manages varied concerns. Taken in isolation, these metrics point to a class that would benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more cohesive modules."
