    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.ParseError",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=52), moderate method count (NOM=8) with low complexity (WMC=8), very low field count (NOF=3) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader). Given the class-level metrics and low complexity/cohesion, there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
