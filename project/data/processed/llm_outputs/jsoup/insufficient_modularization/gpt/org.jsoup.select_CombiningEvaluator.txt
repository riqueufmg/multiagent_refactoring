    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: loc=112 and nom=7 show a modest size and number of methods; wmc=11 indicates only moderate complexity; lcom=0.0 indicates high cohesion (methods are related); nopm=1 (single public method) implies a small public API surface; nof=5 fields is small; dit=1 (shallow inheritance) and fanin=0/fanout=0 show limited coupling. Based on these elements, the class appears cohesive and not large/complex enough to require further decomposition."
