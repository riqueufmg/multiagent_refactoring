    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=79), moderate/low complexity (wmc=7), modest number of methods (nom=7, nopm=6), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and a cohesion indicator showing cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Coupling appears low (fanout=0, fanin=0) and dependencies are limited to related selector/node classes. These elements suggest the class is small, cohesive, and not a candidate for further decomposition in isolation."
