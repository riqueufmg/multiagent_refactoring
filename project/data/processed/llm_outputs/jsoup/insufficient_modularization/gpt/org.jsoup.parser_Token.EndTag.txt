    "justification": "Class is very small and does not show signs of being insufficiently modularized: LOC=8, number of methods/fields = 0 (nom=0, nof=0, nopf=0), low complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), DIT=1 and LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion data). These metrics indicate a minimal/simple class, not one that requires further decomposition."
