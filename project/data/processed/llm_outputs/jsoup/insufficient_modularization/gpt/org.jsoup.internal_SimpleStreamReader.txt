    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive — LOC=62, fields=3, methods (nom)=4 (public methods nopm=3) and LCOM=0.0 indicating high cohesion. Although WMC=16 shows some method complexity, the limited number of methods and modest size do not indicate a class that has not been decomposed; additionally DIT=0, fanin=0 and fanout=0 do not suggest broad, scattered responsibilities."
