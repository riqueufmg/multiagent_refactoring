    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits multiple indicators of insufficient modularization: 22 methods (nom) and 196 LOC indicate a large implementation surface; a high weighted method count (WMC = 55) shows substantial internal complexity; LCOM = 0.5 indicates only moderate cohesion (methods are not highly focused); only 4 fields combined with 22 methods gives a high methods-per-field ratio suggesting multiple responsibilities. Additionally, the class depends on a large number of external types (20 dependencies), implying it handles varied concerns. DIT = 1 indicates complexity is contained in the class itself rather than distributed through inheritance. Together these metrics point to a class that would likely benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
