    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Printer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for further decomposition: it has moderate-to-large size (loc=176) and implementation complexity (wmc=14) while defining many methods (nom=9) and fields (nof=5). It depends on a variety of concerns (Entities, NodeUtils, StringUtil, Tag, QuietAppendable, Node, TextNode, LeafNode, Element), indicating it mixes responsibilities such as node traversal/printing, entity escaping, and formatting. Only 2 public methods (nopm=2) with the remainder likely private helpers suggests internal complexity that could be split into focused collaborators. Although cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), the combination of size, complexity, and diverse dependencies justifies decomposing the class (for example: separate escaper/formatter/printer-for-leaf-vs-element) to reduce size and implementation complexity."
