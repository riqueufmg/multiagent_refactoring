    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 244), high implementation complexity (WMC = 59), many methods (nom = 27) and many fields (nof = 24). The number and variety of dependencies (TokeniserState, Token, TokenData, CharacterReader, Entities, ParseErrorList, TreeBuilder, Tag, Document, etc.) indicate multiple responsibilities (state management, character reading, token creation, entity handling, error reporting). While LCOM = 0.111 suggests reasonable cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high WMC, and many fields/methods indicates the class could be further decomposed to reduce complexity and size."
