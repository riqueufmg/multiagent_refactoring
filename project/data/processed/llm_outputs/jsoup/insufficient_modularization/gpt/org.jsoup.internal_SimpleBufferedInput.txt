    "justification": "Do not detect Insufficient Modularization: although WMC = 34 indicates method complexity, the class size is moderate (LOC = 120) with a modest number of methods (nom = 11, nopm = 6) and fields (nof = 7). Crucially LCOM = 0.0 indicates high cohesion (methods operate on shared state), so there is no clear evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities that would justify further decomposition. Fan-in/fan-out are 0 in the provided data, giving no coupling indicators to support splitting the class."
