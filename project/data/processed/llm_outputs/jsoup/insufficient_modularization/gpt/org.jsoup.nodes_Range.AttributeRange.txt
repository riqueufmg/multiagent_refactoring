    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=41), very few fields (NOF=3), no methods (NOM=0, NOPM=0) and zero complexity (WMC=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) does not suggest low cohesion. Given these values, the class is small, simple and does not present evidence that it needs further decomposition."
