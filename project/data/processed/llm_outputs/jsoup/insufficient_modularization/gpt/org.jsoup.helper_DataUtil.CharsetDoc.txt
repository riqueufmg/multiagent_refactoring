    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=13, nof=3 fields, nom=0 methods, wmc=0. Low complexity and low coupling: fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on org.jsoup.nodes.Document. LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion concerns in the provided data. Given the small size, lack of complex behavior, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
