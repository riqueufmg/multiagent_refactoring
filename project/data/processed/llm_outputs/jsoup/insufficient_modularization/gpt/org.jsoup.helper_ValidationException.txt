    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=20, nom=2, nof=1. Complexity is low (wmc=4) and there are no external dependencies or coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LCOM=1.0 indicates low cohesion, the class has only two methods and minimal state, so there is insufficient evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. Based on the isolated metrics, refactoring for modularization is not warranted."
