    "justification": "High lack of cohesion (LCOM = 1.0) together with multiple methods (nom = 5, nopm = 4) and several fields (nof = 4) indicates the class groups unrelated functionality. Although the class is short (LOC = 24), the WMC = 5 shows non-trivial internal complexity and fanin/fanout = 0 shows it is self-contained; these factors suggest the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization to improve cohesion and reduce complexity."
