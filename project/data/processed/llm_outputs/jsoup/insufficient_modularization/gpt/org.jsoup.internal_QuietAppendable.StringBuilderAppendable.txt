    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that requires further decomposition: LOC=24 (small), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods / no internal complexity), NOF=1 (single field), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling). These values show the class is small and simple in isolation, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
