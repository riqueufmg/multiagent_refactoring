    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=15, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no internal complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance is shallow (DIT=1). There are no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and do not justify further decomposition."
