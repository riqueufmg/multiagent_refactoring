    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Document",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows multiple signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 447) combined with many methods (NOM = 31, NOPM = 27) and high complexity (WMC = 51) indicating substantial implementation surface and behavioural complexity; a relatively high number of fields (NOF = 13) and many external dependencies (Elements, FormElement, Entities, Evaluator, OutputSettings, Parser, DocumentType, XmlDeclaration, QuirksMode, ParseSettings, Jsoup, DataUtil, StringUtil, Validate, Connection, Node, Element) suggesting it mixes responsibilities (parsing, DOM manipulation, output/configuration, entity handling, form handling, quirks/output modes); presence of nested/document-specific types in the dependency list (Document.Syntax, Document.OutputSettings, Document.QuirksMode) further implies multiple concerns handled inside the same class; cohesion metric is moderate (LCOM = 0.3548) rather than very high, supporting the view of mixed responsibilities. Taken in isolation, these factors indicate the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split to reduce size and complexity."
