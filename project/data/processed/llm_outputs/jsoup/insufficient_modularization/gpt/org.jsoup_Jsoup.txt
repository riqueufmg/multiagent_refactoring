    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 24) with almost all public (nopm = 23) creating a large external API surface; large size (loc = 269) and elevated complexity (wmc = 25) for a single class; interacts with varied responsibilities as indicated by its dependencies (org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection, org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner, org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil, org.jsoup.Connection, org.jsoup.parser.Parser, org.jsoup.safety.Safelist), suggesting it handles parsing, HTTP, cleaning, data utilities and safelisting concerns. dit = 0 but substantial functionality is concentrated in one class, supporting decomposition into smaller, more focused classes or modules."
