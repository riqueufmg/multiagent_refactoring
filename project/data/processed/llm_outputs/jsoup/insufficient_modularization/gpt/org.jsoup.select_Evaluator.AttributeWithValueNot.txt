    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=17), no methods (nom=0) and no measurable complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. Given the class in isolation, there is no evidence it is too large or complex and thus no justification for further decomposition."
