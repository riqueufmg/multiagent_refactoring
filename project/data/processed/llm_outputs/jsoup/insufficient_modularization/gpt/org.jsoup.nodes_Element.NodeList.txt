    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=18, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0 (no internal complexity), DIT=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 (no coupling), LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion concern given lack of methods). No dependencies reported. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
