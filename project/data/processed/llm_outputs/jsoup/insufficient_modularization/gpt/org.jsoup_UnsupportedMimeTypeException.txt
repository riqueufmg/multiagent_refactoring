    "class": "org.jsoup.UnsupportedMimeTypeException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=21, NOM=4, WMC=4, NOF=2, LCOM=0.0. Low complexity and few methods/fields with no fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) provide no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further. Based on the provided isolated metrics, it is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization."
