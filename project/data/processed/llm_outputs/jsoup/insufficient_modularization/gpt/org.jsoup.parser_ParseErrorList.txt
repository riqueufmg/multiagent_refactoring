    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=36, WMC=7, NOM=7 (NOPM=3), NOF=3. LCOM=0.4286 indicates acceptable cohesion. There are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and DIT=0. Given the low size, moderate complexity and decent cohesion, there is no evidence the class has not been sufficiently decomposed."
