    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: it has 0 methods (nom=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2), a small size (loc=30), and no measured complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0). There are no dependencies. These metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that should be decomposed further."
