    "detection": true,
    "justification": "WMC = 21 (relatively high implementation complexity) combined with LOC = 84 and nom = 8 (nopm = 6) indicates a moderately large class with many (including public) methods. nof = 6 fields suggests substantial internal state. LCOM = 0.25 shows only moderate cohesion (not strongly cohesive), implying responsibilities may be mixed. Dependencies on org.jsoup.helper.Validate and org.jsoup.nodes.Node indicate the class performs both iteration and validation/interaction logic. Together these metrics suggest the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split to reduce size and complexity."
