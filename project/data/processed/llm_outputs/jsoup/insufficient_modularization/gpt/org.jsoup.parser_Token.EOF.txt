    "justification": "Token.EOF shows no signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=12, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, NOPM=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, DIT=1, LCOM=-1.0. The class has no methods or fields, zero complexity and zero coupling in the provided data, so there is nothing to further decompose in isolation and no evidence that additional modularization would reduce size or complexity."
