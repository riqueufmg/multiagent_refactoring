    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=341), very high complexity (wmc=111), and many methods (nom=31) indicating multiple responsibilities concentrated in one class. It has several fields (nof=8) but no inheritance (dit=0), and the dependency list (Evaluator, StructuralEvaluator, CombiningEvaluator, NodeEvaluator, TokenQueue, Regex, StringUtil, Normalizer, Selector, Validate) indicates it handles parsing, tokenizing, evaluator construction and normalization concerns that could be split into smaller classes/modules. These metrics and dependencies together justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
