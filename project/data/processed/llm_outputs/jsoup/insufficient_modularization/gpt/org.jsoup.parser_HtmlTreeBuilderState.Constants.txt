    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilderState.Constants",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class contains a large number of fields (nof = 39) while having no methods (nom = 0) and only 41 lines of code (loc = 41). The high field count combined with zero behavioral decomposition (wmc = 0) indicates this class is acting as a bulky container of constants/attributes and could be further decomposed into smaller, focused classes or enums to reduce size and improve modularity."
