    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=19, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0 (no complexity), number of fields=1, fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), DIT=1 (shallow inheritance), LCOM=-1.0 (cohesive). No dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
