    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 765), very high method count (nom = 95) and high cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc = 227) indicating multiple responsibilities. It also declares many fields (nof = 31) and depends on numerous other types (TokeniserState, Token, Document, Element, Tag, Parser, etc.), which suggests it coordinates varied functionality that could be split. Although cohesion (lcom = 0.242) is not extremely poor, the sheer volume of code and methods strongly indicates the class has not been decomposed enough and would benefit from further modularization."
