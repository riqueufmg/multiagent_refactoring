    "justification": "LOC=102 (relatively large) and nof=6 (several fields) while nom=0 and wmc=0 (no reported methods/complexity) indicate the class contains substantial implementation/state without being decomposed into methods/classes; dit=1 (no deep inheritance) and fanin=0/fanout=0 (self-contained) suggest responsibilities are bundled rather than distributed; dependency on org.jsoup.nodes.Element points to at least one concrete responsibility (DOM conversion) within this large unit. These elements together justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
