    "justification": "Class has 10 fields and 1 method but is very small (LOC=17) with low complexity (WMC=1), perfect cohesion indicator (LCOM=0.0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate a compact constants/utility holder rather than an incompletely decomposed large class; further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
