    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=28, number of fields=1, number of methods=0 (nom=0), WMC=0, DIT=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only one external dependency (org.jsoup.parser.ParseSettings). There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, low cohesion, or many responsibilities that would suggest the class has not been decomposed further. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
