    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Request",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics show a large, likely under-decomposed class: loc=162 and nof=19 (many fields) combined with nom=0 (no methods) and LCOM=-1.0 (poor/low cohesion). The class also depends on multiple components (org.jsoup.Progress, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection, org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil, org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator, org.jsoup.Connection, org.jsoup.parser.Parser), suggesting mixed responsibilities. These elements (high LOC, many fields, no methods, low cohesion, and multiple dependencies) indicate insufficient modularization and that further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
