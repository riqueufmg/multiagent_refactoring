    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LCOM=1.0 (maximum lack of cohesion) indicates methods do not share common state; nom=4 with nof=2 shows few fields but multiple methods operating on different concerns; loc=63 with wmc=5 implies relatively large implementation spread across non-cohesive methods; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate the class is isolated so responsibilities can be separated without high coupling. These elements together justify that the class is insufficiently modular and could be decomposed."
