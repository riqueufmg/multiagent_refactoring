    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.StreamParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LOC=259 and WMC=19 indicate moderate size/complexity but not excessive; NOM=18 with NOF=9 and NOPM=18 shows the class exposes methods but cohesion is high (LCOM=0.222), which argues against a decomposability problem. Presence of an inner ElementIterator and explicit parser-related dependencies suggests responsibilities are focused. Given the moderate metrics and good cohesion, there is insufficient evidence that the class is under-modularized or would clearly benefit from further decomposition."
