    "justification": "High cyclomatic complexity (WMC = 20) in a relatively small class (LOC = 86) with 6 methods (NOM = 6) indicates concentrated complexity; moderate cohesion (LCOM = 0.5) and only one field (NOF = 1) imply methods do not heavily share state and could be separated into distinct modules; DIT = 1 shows no deep inheritance is used for decomposition; dependencies on AuthenticationHandler, HttpConnection, and Connection suggest the class touches multiple responsibilities. These factors indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition (Insufficient Modularization)."
