    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation size (loc=124) combined with high cyclomatic complexity (wmc=32) while having a small number of methods (nom=4, nopm=4) indicates the class contains few but large/complex methods. Average complexity per method (~8) and the presence of multiple related dependencies (org.jsoup.select.NodeVisitor, org.jsoup.select.NodeFilter, org.jsoup.nodes.Node, org.jsoup.select.Elements) suggest multiple responsibilities are handled inside this single class. These metrics (high LOC and WMC with low NOM) are characteristic of insufficient modularization and justify decomposition to reduce method size and implementation complexity."
