    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=23, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). There are no methods to split and overall implementation complexity is zero, so there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
