    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=29, NOM=1, WMC=3, LCOM=0.0, NOF=1. It exposes a single method and low cyclomatic complexity, indicating a single, focused responsibility. Given its small size and low complexity, further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or implementation complexity. Analysis done in isolation (no system-level context) supports not flagging Insufficient Modularization."
