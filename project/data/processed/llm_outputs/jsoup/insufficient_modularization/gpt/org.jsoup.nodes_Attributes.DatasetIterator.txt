    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes.DatasetIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: small size (LOC=17), minimal fields (NOF=2), no methods (NOM=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (WMC=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single dependency (org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute). These metrics indicate the class is simple and does not warrant further decomposition."
