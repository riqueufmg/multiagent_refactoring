    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and non-complex: LOC=17, WMC=0, number of methods=0, number of fields=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the absence of internal methods/fields and low complexity/size, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
