    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Base",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 145) while having 0 methods (nom = 0) and 5 fields (nof = 5), indicating substantial implementation in a single unit without method-level decomposition. Cohesion metric is unavailable/invalid (lcom = -1.0), and complexity metrics (wmc = 0) do not reflect internal decomposition. These elements (high LOC combined with nonzero fields and no methods) justify that the class is not sufficiently decomposed and likely should be split into smaller, more focused classes."
