    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no behavior to decompose: loc=9, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0, nof=1 (single field), fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=0. These metrics show negligible size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or would benefit from further decomposition."
