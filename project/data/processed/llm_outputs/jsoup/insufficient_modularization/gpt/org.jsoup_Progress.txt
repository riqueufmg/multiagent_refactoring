    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=11, nom=1, wmc=1. High cohesion indicated by lcom=-1.0 and only one method. Low coupling and isolation: fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies. Given its minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition (insufficient modularization) is needed."
