    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=322) and high complexity (wmc=50) with many methods (nom=26) and fields (nof=10), indicating a lot of behavior and state in one class. Cohesion is only moderate (lcom=0.5), suggesting multiple responsibilities that could be split. Although there are related internal components referenced (dependencies include SoftPool and StringUtil.StringJoiner), the remaining high LOC/WMC and method count imply further decomposition would reduce size and complexity."
