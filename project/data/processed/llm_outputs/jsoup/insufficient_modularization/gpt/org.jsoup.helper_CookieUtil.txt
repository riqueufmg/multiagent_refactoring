    "justification": "Metrics indicate insufficient modularization: small number of methods (nom=5) but high complexity (WMC=17) and concentrated size (LOC=78) — suggesting methods combine multiple responsibilities. Moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.6) and four fields (NOF=4) imply mixed concerns. No inheritance or further decomposition indicators (DIT=0, nopf=0, nopm=0). Together these elements justify further decomposition into smaller, more focused modules."
