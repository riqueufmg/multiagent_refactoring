    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.SoftPool",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=50, NOM=4, NOF=3, WMC=7 and LCOM=0.0. LOW LOC and small number of methods/fields show limited responsibility; WMC=7 is modest complexity, and LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, showing no evident coupling that would motivate splitting for modularization. Given these elements, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity—Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
