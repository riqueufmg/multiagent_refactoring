    "class": "org.jsoup.Connection.Method",

    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=18, number of fields=1 (nof=1), number of methods=0 (nom=0), WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. With no methods, minimal size/complexity and no dependencies, there is no indication that the class has not been decomposed further or would benefit from additional modularization (LCOM=-1.0 is not indicating fragmentation here). Therefore Insufficient Modularization is unlikely."
