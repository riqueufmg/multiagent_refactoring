    "justification": "Metrics in isolation do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=91 (moderate size), number of methods nom=0 and number of fields nof=0 show no internal decomposition to evaluate, WMC=0 indicates no measured complexity, LCOM=-1.0 is undefined/invalid for cohesion assessment, and fanin=0/fanout=0 show no coupling evidence. Given the absence of methods/fields and no signs of high size, complexity, or low cohesion in the provided data, insufficient modularization is not detected."
