    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token.Character",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has low size and complexity: LOC=44, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=2. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and DIT=1. There are no methods to decompose and only two fields; dependencies (TokeniserState, TokenData, Tokeniser) are limited. Given the small LOC, zero method complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized."
