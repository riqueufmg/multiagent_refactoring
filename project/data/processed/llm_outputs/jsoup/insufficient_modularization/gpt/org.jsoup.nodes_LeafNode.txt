    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.LeafNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show strong signs of Insufficient Modularization: NOM=21 (12 public) and LOC=89 indicate a moderate size, WMC=25 is elevated but not extreme, and LCOM=0.3809 indicates reasonable cohesion. There is only 1 field (NOF=1) and measured coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a shallow inheritance depth (DIT=1). Taken in isolation, these metrics suggest the class is not overly large or poorly decomposed and does not require immediate decomposition."
