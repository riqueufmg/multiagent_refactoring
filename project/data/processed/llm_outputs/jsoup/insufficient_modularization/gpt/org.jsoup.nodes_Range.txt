    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Range",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and handling multiple concerns: LOC = 202 and WMC = 16 indicate substantial size and complexity; nof = 10 fields and nom = 11 methods (nopm = 10 public) show many responsibilities/exposed operations. The class also contains nested types (Range.AttributeRange, Range.Position) per the dependencies, suggesting it aggregates distinct roles (position management and attribute-range logic) that could be extracted. Although LCOM = 0.0 suggests cohesion, the combination of high LOC, numerous fields/methods, and inner types supports that further decomposition would reduce size and implementation complexity."
