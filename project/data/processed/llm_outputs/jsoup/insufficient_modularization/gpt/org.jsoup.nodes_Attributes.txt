    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Indicators show insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 522), high method count (NOM = 48, of which NOPM = 33 public), high complexity (WMC = 99), and many fields (NOF = 14). The substantial public API surface (33 public methods) together with high cyclomatic/weighted complexity suggests multiple responsibilities and implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposition. While cohesion appears good (LCOM = 0.0833), the sheer size and complexity and the listed dependencies (org.jsoup.nodes.Range, org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute, org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer, org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable, org.jsoup.internal.SharedConstants, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.parser.ParseSettings) support refactoring the class into smaller modules to improve maintainability and reduce complexity."
