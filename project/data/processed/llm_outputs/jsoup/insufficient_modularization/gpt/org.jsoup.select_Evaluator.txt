    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 773) indicating concentrated code that could be split; high number of fields (nof = 24) suggesting multiple responsibilities/state pieces; moderate-low cohesion (lcom = 0.6666666666666666) implying related behavior is not well grouped; relatively small number of methods (nom = 9) combined with large LOC (high LOC per method) pointing to large, complex method implementations rather than finer-grained components. Additionally, no inheritance depth (dit = 0) reduces decomposition via subclassing. Together these metrics support that the class should be further decomposed."
