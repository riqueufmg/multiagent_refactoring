    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=56), very low implementation complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0) indicating a simple data-holder role, modest number of fields (nof=4), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single listed dependency (org.jsoup.Connection). These metrics do not indicate a large, undecomposed class or multiple responsibilities that would warrant further decomposition."
