    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and not complex: LOC=8, NOF=0 (no fields), NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no complexity), DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, and no dependencies. Given the lack of size, methods, fields, and complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not present."
