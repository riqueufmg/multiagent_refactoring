    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=14, nom=4, wmc=4, nof=2. No external coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance (dit=0). Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion, the very small size and low method count mean there is insufficient evidence that the class has not been decomposed; it does not exhibit the typical signs of Insufficient Modularization (large size, high complexity, many responsibilities)."
