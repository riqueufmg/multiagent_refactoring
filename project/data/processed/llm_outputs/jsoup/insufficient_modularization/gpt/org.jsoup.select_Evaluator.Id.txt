    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.Id",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=18, NOM=0, WMC=0, no fields of functional complexity (NOF=1 but NOPF=0), DIT=1, LCOM=-1.0; coupling is negligible (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class has no methods or complexity to decompose further, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
