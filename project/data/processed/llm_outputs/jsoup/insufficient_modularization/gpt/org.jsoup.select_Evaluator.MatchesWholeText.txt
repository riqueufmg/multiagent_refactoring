    "justification": "Metrics show the class is very small and simple: LOC=22, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0, DIT=1, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There is only a single external dependency (org.jsoup.helper.Regex). The low size, zero/near-zero complexity and minimal coupling indicate there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
