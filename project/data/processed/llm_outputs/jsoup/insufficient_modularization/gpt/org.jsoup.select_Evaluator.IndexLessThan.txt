    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.IndexLessThan",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=14 and WMC=0 indicate minimal implementation size and complexity. It has no methods or fields recorded (nom=0, nof=0) and no couplings (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is large or doing multiple responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
