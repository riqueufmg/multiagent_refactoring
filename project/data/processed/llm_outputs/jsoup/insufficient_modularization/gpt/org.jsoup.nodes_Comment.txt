    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Comment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has small size and moderate complexity (loc=57, nom=9, wmc=10) which do not indicate an overly large or complex implementation. Cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0), suggesting related responsibilities are grouped. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and the inheritance depth is shallow (dit=2), so there is no evidence the class mixes unrelated concerns that would benefit from decomposition. Given these metrics and the limited dependency list (org.jsoup.parser.Parser, org.jsoup.nodes.XmlDeclaration, org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable, org.jsoup.nodes.Document), there is no strong indication of Insufficient Modularization."
