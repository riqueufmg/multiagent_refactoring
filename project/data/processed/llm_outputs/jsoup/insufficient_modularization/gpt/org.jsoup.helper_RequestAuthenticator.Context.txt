    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, monolithic class. The class has 57 LOC and only 3 fields (nof=3) with no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no listed dependencies. These values imply a small, low-complexity, likely data-holder class rather than a large class requiring further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
