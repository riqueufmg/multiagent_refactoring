    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.Tag",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and trivial: LOC=18, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, number of fields (nof)=1. Low inheritance depth (DIT=1), LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issues given no methods), and zero fan-in/fan-out. These metrics indicate minimal size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
