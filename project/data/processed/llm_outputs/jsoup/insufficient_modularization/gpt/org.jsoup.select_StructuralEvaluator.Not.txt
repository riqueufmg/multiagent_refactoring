    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=14, WMC=0. High cohesion indicated by LCOM=-1.0. Minimal responsibilities (NOF=0, NOM=0) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=2 does not imply internal size/complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. Therefore it is not a case of Insufficient Modularization."
