    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=74, WMC=4, NOM=4. Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). There are no incoming or outgoing coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few external dependencies. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class that would benefit from further modularization; the presence of 4 fields alone does not justify decomposition given the low method count and complexity."
