    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=18, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOF=2. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. There is no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
