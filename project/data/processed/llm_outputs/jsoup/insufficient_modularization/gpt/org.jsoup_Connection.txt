    "class": "org.jsoup.Connection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very large (loc = 772) with many methods (nom = 43), and high aggregate complexity (wmc = 43) — these indicate a single type carrying many responsibilities. It declares or depends on multiple distinct inner/related types (org.jsoup.Connection.Response, org.jsoup.Connection.KeyVal, org.jsoup.Connection.Request, org.jsoup.Connection.Method) and other dependencies (org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.Progress, org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator, org.jsoup.parser.Parser), suggesting it groups multiple concerns that could be split. Low inheritance depth (dit = 0) and minimal decomposition via subclasses (nc = 1) imply the functionality has not been factored out. Given these metrics (loc, nom, wmc) and the multiplicity of contained roles/dependencies, the class appears insufficiently modularized and would likely benefit from further decomposition."
