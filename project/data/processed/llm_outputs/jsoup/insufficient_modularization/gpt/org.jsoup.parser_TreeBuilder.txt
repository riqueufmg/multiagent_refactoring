    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely case of Insufficient Modularization: it defines a large number of methods (nom = 32) and fields (nof = 13) and spans a non-trivial size (loc = 263) while exhibiting high implementation complexity (wmc = 56). It also depends on many types (16 distinct dependencies), indicating multiple responsibilities and coupling to varied concerns. Although LCOM = 0.1875 shows intra-class cohesion, the combination of high method count and high cyclomatic complexity indicates the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
