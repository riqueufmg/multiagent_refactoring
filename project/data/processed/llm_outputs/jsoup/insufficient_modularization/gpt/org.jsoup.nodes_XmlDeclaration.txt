    "justification": "LOC=65 and NOM=9 (NOPM=6) with WMC=12 indicate a relatively large and complex class; LCOM=0.7777777777777778 shows low cohesion (methods are not well related), and there is only 1 field (NOF=1) while many methods operate, which suggests behavior is not centered on a single responsibility. The class also depends on varied components (org.jsoup.nodes.Entities, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable, org.jsoup.nodes.Document), implying mixed responsibilities (string/entity handling, output/appendable concerns, document context). These metrics collectively point to Insufficient Modularization and support refactoring into smaller, more focused classes."
