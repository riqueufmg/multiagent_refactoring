    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token.Tag",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has substantial size (loc=145) and a large number of fields (nof=14) while containing no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating it holds multiple pieces of state and responsibilities in one place. It also depends on several different types (org.jsoup.nodes.Range, TokeniserState, TokenData, TreeBuilder, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes, Tokeniser), suggesting multiple concerns. With a shallow inheritance depth (dit=1) and many fields, further decomposition into smaller, focused classes would likely reduce size and complexity."
