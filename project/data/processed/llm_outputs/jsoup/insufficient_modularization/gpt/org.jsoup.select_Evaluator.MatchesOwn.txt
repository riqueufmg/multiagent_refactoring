    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=21, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1. It has no methods to decompose (NOM=0), minimal state (NOF=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single external dependency (org.jsoup.helper.Regex). Its inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not exhibit signs that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
