    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token.Comment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=27, number of fields=2, number of methods=0 (nom=0), WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single dependency on org.jsoup.parser.TokenData. DIT=1 and LCOM=-1.0 do not suggest low cohesion. Given the low size, complexity, and coupling, there is no evidence that this class needs further decomposition."
