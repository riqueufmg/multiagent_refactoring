    "class": "org.jsoup.Connection.Request",

    "justification": "The class has a high size (loc = 179) while having no reported methods or fields (nom = 0, nof = 0) and no method-complexity reported (wmc = 0). This discrepancy (large LOC but zero methods/fields) indicates the implementation is not decomposed into smaller methods/classes. fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show it is self-contained, and lcom = -1.0 is unavailable, so cohesion cannot be confirmed; overall the metrics point to insufficient modularization and a need to decompose the class."
