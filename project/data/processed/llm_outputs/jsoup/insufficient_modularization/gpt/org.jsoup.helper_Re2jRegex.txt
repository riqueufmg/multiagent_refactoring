    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=37, NOM=4, WMC=4 indicate low size and complexity. LCOM=0.5 shows moderate-to-good cohesion. Few fields (NOF=3) and few public methods (NOPM=3) mean no excessive responsibility. Fan-out=0 and Fan-in=0 show low coupling; only one dependency listed (org.jsoup.helper.Regex). DIT=1 is shallow. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
