    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner.CleaningVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The class is small and not complex: LOC=45, no methods (nom=0) and WMC=0, only 3 fields (nof=3). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single listed dependency (org.jsoup.nodes.Element). LCOM is not meaningful here (no methods). Given these metrics and analyzing the class in isolation, there is no evidence it is a large or monolithic class that requires further decomposition."
