    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.ControllableInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 169), high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 34), many methods (nom = 17) with most exposed (nopm = 14), and a substantial number of fields (nof = 12). These counts indicate the class likely combines multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity. (Noting dependencies: org.jsoup.Progress, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.internal.SimpleBufferedInput.)"
