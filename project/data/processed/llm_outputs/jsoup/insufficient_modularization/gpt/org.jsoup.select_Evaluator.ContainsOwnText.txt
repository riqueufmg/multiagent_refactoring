    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: loc=15, no methods (nom=0), one field (nof=1), zero complexity (wmc=0), shallow inheritance (dit=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no external dependencies. These elements indicate no indication that the class needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
