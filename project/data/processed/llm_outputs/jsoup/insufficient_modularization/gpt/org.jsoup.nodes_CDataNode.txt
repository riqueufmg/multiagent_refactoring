    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=24, WMC=5, NOM=5 (NOPM=4). High cohesion indicated by LCOM=-1.0. No fields (NOF=0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 2 external dependencies). Although DIT=3, the class size and low complexity mean it does not appear to need further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
