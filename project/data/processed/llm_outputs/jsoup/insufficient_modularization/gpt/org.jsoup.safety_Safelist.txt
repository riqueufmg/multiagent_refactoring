    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Safelist",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class is relatively large (loc=399) with moderate complexity (wmc=54) and many methods (nom=22, nopm=20), the cohesion is high (lcom=0.1818) and it has a limited set of fields (nof=7). The metrics indicate a focused, cohesive responsibility rather than an undecomposed collection of unrelated functionality, so there is no clear evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
