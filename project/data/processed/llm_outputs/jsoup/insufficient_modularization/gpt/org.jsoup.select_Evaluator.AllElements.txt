    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class considered in isolation shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=14), no methods/fields reported (NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPM=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), low inheritance depth (DIT=1), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), no external dependencies, and LCOM value not indicating cohesion issues. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
