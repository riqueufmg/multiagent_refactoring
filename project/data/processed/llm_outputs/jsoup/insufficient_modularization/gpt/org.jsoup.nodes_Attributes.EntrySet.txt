    "justification": "Metrics show no indication of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=11), no fields or methods reported (nof=0, nom=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 appears as not-applicable/unknown but other metrics indicate the class is small and simple and does not require further decomposition."
