    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Parser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Parser class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it contains a large number of methods (nom = 30) and substantial size (loc = 298) with non-trivial complexity (wmc = 33). It also holds many fields (nof = 11) and directly depends on multiple distinct concerns (org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder and org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder indicate handling both HTML and XML tree-building responsibilities; plus dependencies on Tokeniser, ParseErrorList, TagSet, ParseSettings, Element, Document). Together these indicate the class combines multiple responsibilities (coordination, tokenisation, error handling, format-specific tree building) that could be split into smaller, focused modules (for example separate HTML and XML parser/coordinator classes or delegating more behavior to helper classes). Although cohesion is not extremely poor (lcom = 0.2667), the method count, size, complexity, and the presence of format-specific dependencies justify refactoring to improve modularization."
