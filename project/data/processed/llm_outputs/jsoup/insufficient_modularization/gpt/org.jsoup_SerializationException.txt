    "class": "org.jsoup.SerializationException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=33), low complexity (WMC=4), a small number of methods (NOM=4), no fields (NOF=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion problems. These metrics suggest the class is already compact and focused, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
