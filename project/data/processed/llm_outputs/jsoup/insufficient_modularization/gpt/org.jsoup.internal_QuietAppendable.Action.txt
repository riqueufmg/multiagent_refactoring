    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no behavior or state: loc=3, nom=0, nopm=0, nopf=0, wmc=0, nc=0. No incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metrics are not applicable due to absence of members. Given the minimal size and zero complexity, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
