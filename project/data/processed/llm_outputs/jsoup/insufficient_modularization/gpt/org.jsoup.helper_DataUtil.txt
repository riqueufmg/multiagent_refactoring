    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows multiple indicators of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 316) and a relatively high number of fields (NOF = 10); high implementation complexity (WMC = 49); many methods (NOM = 19, with NOPM = 8 public methods) which suggests multiple responsibilities; moderate/low cohesion (LCOM = 0.4736842105263157) indicating methods are not tightly focused on a single concern; and a wide variety of dependencies (org.jsoup.select.Elements, org.jsoup.nodes.Comment, org.jsoup.select.Evaluator, org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.internal.ControllableInputStream, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil.CharsetDoc, org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer, org.jsoup.nodes.Node, org.jsoup.nodes.XmlDeclaration, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.parser.StreamParser, org.jsoup.parser.Parser, org.jsoup.internal.SimpleStreamReader) implying it handles parsing, stream/charset handling, normalization, and node/document concerns. Taken in isolation, these factors justify that DataUtil has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
