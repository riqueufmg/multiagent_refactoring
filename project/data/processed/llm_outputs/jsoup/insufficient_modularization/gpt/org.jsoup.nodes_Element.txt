    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Element",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 1571), a very high number of methods (nom = 157, nopm = 133 public methods) and high complexity (wmc = 241). It has many external responsibilities as indicated by a long dependency list (includes selectors, parsers, printers, node types, utilities), yet a small number of fields (nof = 11) and shallow inheritance (dit = 1), suggesting functionality is concentrated in this single class rather than distributed. These metrics (high LOC, high method count, high WMC, many dependencies) indicate the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
