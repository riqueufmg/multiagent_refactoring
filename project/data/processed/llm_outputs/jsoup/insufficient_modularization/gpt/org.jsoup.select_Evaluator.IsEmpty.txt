    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal structure to decompose: loc=14, nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no complexity). Cohesion (lcom=-1.0) and depth (dit=1) show no indication of a large, complex implementation. fanin=0 and fanout=0 with no dependencies indicate no hidden responsibilities. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized."
