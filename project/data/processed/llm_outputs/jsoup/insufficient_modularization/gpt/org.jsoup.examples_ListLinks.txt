    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: the class is small and simple (loc=34) with few methods (nom=3, nopm=1), moderate cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=8) and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few external dependencies (org.jsoup.select.Elements, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.Jsoup, org.jsoup.nodes.Document) further suggest the class does not need further decomposition in isolation."
