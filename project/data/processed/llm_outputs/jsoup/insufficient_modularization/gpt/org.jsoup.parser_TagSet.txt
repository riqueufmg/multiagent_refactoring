    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is large (LOC=167) and relatively complex (WMC=29) with many methods (NOM=14, of which NOPM=10 are public), which suggests multiple responsibilities or a large public surface that could be split. Although LCOM is low (0.1429) indicating reasonable cohesion, the high size and complexity metrics (LOC and WMC) justify further decomposition to reduce implementation complexity and class size."
