    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=16, WMC=3, NOM=2, NOF=0 (no fields). LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 and only three external dependencies (org.jsoup.select.Elements, org.jsoup.Jsoup, org.jsoup.nodes.Document). Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
