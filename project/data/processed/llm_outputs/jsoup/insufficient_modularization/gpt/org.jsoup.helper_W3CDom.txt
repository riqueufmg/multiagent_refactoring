    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high size (LOC = 343) and high complexity (WMC = 28) combined with a large number of methods (NOM = 18, NOPM = 16) and many fields (NOF = 12). Cohesion is only moderate (LCOM = 0.444), indicating the methods do not all work closely on the same state. The dependency set (org.jsoup.select.Selector, org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom.W3CBuilder, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.nodes.DocumentType, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.nodes.Element) suggests multiple responsibilities (DOM building/conversion, validation, string handling, node/type handling). Taken in isolation, these metrics and dependencies support that the class is doing multiple distinct tasks and would benefit from further decomposition."
