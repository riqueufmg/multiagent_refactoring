    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.TokeniserState",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 1386), a very high number of methods (nom = 75), and very high complexity (wmc = 409). Cohesion is relatively low (lcom = 0.293), indicating methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility. A small number of fields (nof = 6) versus many methods suggests the class is implementing multiple responsibilities/behaviors rather than encapsulating state with related operations. Taken in isolation, these metrics indicate the class should be further decomposed into smaller, more focused modules/classes to reduce size and complexity."
