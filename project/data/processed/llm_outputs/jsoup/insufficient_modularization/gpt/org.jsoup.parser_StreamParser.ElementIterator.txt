    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.StreamParser.ElementIterator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is relatively large (loc=66) while containing multiple fields (nof=4) but no declared methods (nom=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0). This combination indicates the class bundles state/behavior without further decomposition. The lack of external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single dependency on org.jsoup.nodes.Element suggest the functionality is concentrated inside this class rather than split into smaller, focused units. These factors (high LOC with several fields and no methods) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization: the class should be further decomposed to reduce size and clarify responsibilities."
