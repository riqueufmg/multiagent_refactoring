    "justification": "Class is unlikely to suffer from Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc = 18), no methods to decompose (nom = 0), minimal fields (nof = 1), very low complexity (wmc = 0), no external coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and shallow inheritance (dit = 1). These metrics show no evidence that the class contains multiple responsibilities or would benefit from further decomposition."
