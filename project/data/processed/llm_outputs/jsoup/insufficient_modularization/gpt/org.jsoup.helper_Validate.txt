    "justification": "The class has a large API and implementation size (nom = 21 total methods, nopm = 19 public methods) and non-trivial complexity (loc = 191, WMC = 37). A high method count combined with high cyclomatic/weighted complexity indicates multiple responsibilities that can be split to reduce size and complexity. LCOM = -1.0 (indeterminate/possible cohesion issues) and the class being standalone (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) further support that it contains enough internal functionality to merit decomposition. These elements justify detection of Insufficient Modularization."
