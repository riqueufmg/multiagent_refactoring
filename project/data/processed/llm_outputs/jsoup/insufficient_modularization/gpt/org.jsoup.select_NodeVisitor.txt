    "justification": "Detection: false. The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=26, NOM=3, WMC=3. Cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) indicates good cohesion. There is no evidence of large size, many methods, or high complexity that would justify further decomposition. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, and DIT=0, showing low coupling and no deep inheritance—factors that do not suggest insufficient modularization."
