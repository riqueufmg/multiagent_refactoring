    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive. Metrics show LOC=68, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=3, LCOM=-1.0 (indicating high cohesion). There is no inheritance complexity (DIT=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only a single inner dependency (org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator.Context). These indicators do not suggest the class needs further decomposition."
