    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.FormElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The class is modest in size (LOC=96) with a small number of methods (NOM=7, NOPM=6) and no public fields (NOPF=0). While WMC=20 indicates some method complexity, the average complexity per method is moderate (~2.9). Cohesion is acceptable (LCOM=0.428), and inheritance depth (DIT=2) is low. Fan-in/fan-out are 0, showing no excessive coupling in the provided data. Overall these metrics do not indicate a large, monolithic class that requires further decomposition."
