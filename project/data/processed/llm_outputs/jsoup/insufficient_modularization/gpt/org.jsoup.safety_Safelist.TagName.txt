    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal complexity: LOC = 8, WMC = 0, NOM = 0, NOPF = 0, NOPM = 0. No coupling or usage: fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dependencies = []. LCOM = -1.0 (no cohesion data/applicable). Given the lack of fields, methods, complexity, and dependencies, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or requires further decomposition."
