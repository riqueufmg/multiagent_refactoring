    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is minimal and does not need further decomposition: LOC=14 (very small), NOM=0 and NOF=0 (no methods or fields), WMC=0 (no complexity), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling). DIT=2 alone does not imply internal complexity. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
