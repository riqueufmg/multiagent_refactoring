    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=9, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted methods complexity (wmc)=0, number of fields (nof)=1. Cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) and zero fan-in/fan-out indicate minimal responsibilities and no internal complexity or coupling that would warrant additional modularization."
