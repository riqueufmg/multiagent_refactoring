    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=43, number of fields=3, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited to org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes and org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute. There are no methods or internal complexity to decompose further, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
