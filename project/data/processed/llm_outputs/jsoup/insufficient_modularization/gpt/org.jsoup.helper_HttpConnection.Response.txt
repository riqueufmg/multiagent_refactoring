    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large implementation size (loc = 388) combined with a relatively high number of fields (nof = 15) indicates substantial internal complexity; the class has multiple external collaborators (org.jsoup.helper.RequestExecutor, org.jsoup.helper.AuthenticationHandler, org.jsoup.internal.ControllableInputStream, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection, org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil, org.jsoup.Connection), suggesting it handles several responsibilities (I/O, authentication, request/response handling, data utility). Method metrics are not populated (nom = 0), but the size and field/dependency profile support that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
