    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=30, NOM=4, WMC=4, NOF=0 and LCOM=-1.0 (indicating high cohesion). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it only depends on org.jsoup.nodes.Document and org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute, suggesting a focused responsibility. These metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition (no evidence of excessive size or complexity)."
