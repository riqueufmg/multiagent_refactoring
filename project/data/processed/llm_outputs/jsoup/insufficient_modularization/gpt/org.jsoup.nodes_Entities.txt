    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Entities",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and complex for a single module: 299 LOC, 21 methods (nom), 18 fields (nof) and a high cyclomatic/complexity metric (WMC = 59). It also depends on multiple distinct concerns (9 listed dependencies: org.jsoup.nodes.EntitiesData, org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader, org.jsoup.nodes.Entities.CoreCharset, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil, org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable, org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.nodes.Entities.EscapeMode, org.jsoup.parser.Parser), indicating it handles parsing, data, escaping and utility responsibilities. Although LCOM is relatively low (0.1429) showing some cohesion, the combination of large size (LOC), high complexity (WMC) and multiple responsibilities suggests the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
