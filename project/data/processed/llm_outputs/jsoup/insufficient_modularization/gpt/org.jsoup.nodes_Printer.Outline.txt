    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=18, NOM=0, NOPM=0, WMC=0 indicate no internal complexity or many responsibilities; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show low coupling; LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable) and no methods/fields reported. Based on these metrics taken in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
