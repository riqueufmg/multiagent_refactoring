    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=15, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Low coupling and impact: fanin=0, fanout=0, no external dependencies. DIT=1 and LCOM=-1.0 indicate no evidence of high complexity or low cohesion that would motivate further decomposition. Therefore there is no indication of Insufficient Modularization."
