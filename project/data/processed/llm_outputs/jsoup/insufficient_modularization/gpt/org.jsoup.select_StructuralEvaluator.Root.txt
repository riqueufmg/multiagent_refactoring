    "justification": "Class has only 11 LOC, 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 and DIT=1. With no behavior or state to decompose (no methods/fields) and very low size/complexity, there is no evidence that further modularization is needed. The LCOM value (-1.0) reflects absence of meaningful cohesion data given no members."
