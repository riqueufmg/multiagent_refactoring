    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Entities.EscapeMode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=32, no methods (nom=0), WMC=0, no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). It has only 4 fields and a single dependency (org.jsoup.nodes.EntitiesData). These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
