    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=21, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0. Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0) and inheritance depth is minimal (dit=1). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has a single external dependency (org.jsoup.helper.Regex). Given the low size, zero method complexity, and low coupling, there is no indication this class requires further decomposition."
