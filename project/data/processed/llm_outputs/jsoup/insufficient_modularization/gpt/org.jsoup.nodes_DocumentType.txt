    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC = 73 (moderate size), NOM = 9 with NOPM = 6 (small number of methods/public methods), WMC = 17 (moderate complexity but not extremely high), LCOM = 0.222 (good cohesion), NOF = 6 (reasonable field count), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (low coupling). Based on these values the class is reasonably cohesive and not excessively large or complex, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
