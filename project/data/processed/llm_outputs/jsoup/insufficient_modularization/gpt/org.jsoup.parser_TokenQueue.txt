    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 396), high complexity (wmc = 86), and many methods (nom = 34, nopm = 23 public methods). These values indicate a single class implementing multiple responsibilities and significant implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposition. Although LCOM is low (0.0588) indicating cohesion, the combination of large LOC, high WMC, and a large number of public methods (exposed API surface) supports refactoring into smaller, focused classes or helper components. The class also interacts with multiple dependencies (org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil), consistent with varied functionality that could be separated."
