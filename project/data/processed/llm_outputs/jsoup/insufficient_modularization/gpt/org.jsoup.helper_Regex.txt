    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.Regex",

    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc = 87) with a non-trivial number of methods (nom = 9, nopm = 5) and an aggregated complexity (wmc = 11), while cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.444). It also declares multiple fields (nof = 3) and exposes a public surface that suggests more than one responsibility. The presence of related but distinct dependencies (org.jsoup.helper.Regex.Matcher and org.jsoup.helper.Re2jRegex) indicates the class both provides matching behavior and wraps/chooses regex implementations, which are separable concerns. fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 indicate the class is not tightly coupled to others and thus is a viable candidate for decomposition. These factors together justify detecting insufficient modularization."
