    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Nodes",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: 26 methods (nom=26, nopm=26) with 247 LOC and a WMC of 38 indicate substantial size and implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposition. The class has only two external dependencies (org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil), suggesting it is largely self-contained rather than delegating responsibilities, which reinforces the likelihood that it bundles multiple responsibilities. These elements (high method count, high LOC, high complexity) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
