    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=19, WMC=0, no fields or methods reported (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0), no dependencies, and LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion issues in the provided data. Given the very low size and complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
