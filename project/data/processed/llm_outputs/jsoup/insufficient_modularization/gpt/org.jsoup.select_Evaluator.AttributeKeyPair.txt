    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=24, nof=2 fields, nom=0 methods. Complexity and coupling are minimal (wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), inheritance depth is low (dit=1), and cohesion metric does not indicate fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). These characteristics show the class is already highly modular and does not require further decomposition."
