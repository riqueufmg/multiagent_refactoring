    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. LOC is small (44), WMC is 0 (no complexity), NOM is 0 (no multiple responsibilities exposed), and LCOM = -1.0 indicates high cohesion. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 (no coupling suggesting hidden responsibilities), and DIT = 1 (shallow hierarchy). These factors imply the class is small, cohesive, and not a candidate for further decomposition."
