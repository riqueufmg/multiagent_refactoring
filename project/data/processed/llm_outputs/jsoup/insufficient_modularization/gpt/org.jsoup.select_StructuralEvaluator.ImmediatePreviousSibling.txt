    "justification": "The class is very small and simple (LOC=16), has no methods or fields reported (nom=0, nof=0), and zero complexity/coupling (WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT is shallow (2) and there are no dependencies. These metrics indicate a single, minimal responsibility and do not support further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
