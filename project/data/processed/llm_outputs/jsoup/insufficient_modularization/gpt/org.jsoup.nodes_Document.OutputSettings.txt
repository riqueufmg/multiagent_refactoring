    "justification": "Class size is large (loc=157) while containing multiple fields (nof=7) which indicates multiple concerns bundled together; low cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0) suggests the members are not well-focused; presence of dependencies on distinct components (org.jsoup.nodes.Entities, org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil) implies the class handles different responsibilities (entity/escaping and data/charset handling); these factors together point to a class that can be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
