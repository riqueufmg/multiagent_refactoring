    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: loc=77 (small size), nom=10 (moderate method count), wmc=19 (complexity not extreme), nof=2 (simple state), lcom=0.2 (high cohesion). Additionally fanin=0 and fanout=0 and only one dependency indicate low coupling. These factors show the class is cohesive and not overly large or complex, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
