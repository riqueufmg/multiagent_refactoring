    "justification": "Class is small and already minimal: LOC=17, NOM=0, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0 (no meaningful cohesion data), FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, no dependencies. Metrics indicate few/no methods, no complexity, and low coupling, so there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
