    "class": "org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: although the class has 220 LOC, it has only 7 methods (nom=7) and a low weighted method count (wmc=7), indicating low internal complexity. Cohesion is good (lcom=0.2857), suggesting methods operate on shared state rather than disparate responsibilities. Public API surface is small (nopm=2), inheritance depth is minimal (dit=1), and coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate a class that is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
