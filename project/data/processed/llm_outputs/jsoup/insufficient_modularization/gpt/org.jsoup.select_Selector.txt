    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Selector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: moderate size (loc=161) combined with non-trivial complexity (wmc=19) and a relatively large external API (nom=12, nopm=10) indicate multiple responsibilities. The dependency set (org.jsoup.select.Elements, Collector, Evaluator, QueryParser, org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.nodes.Element) suggests the class touches parsing, evaluation, and collection concerns. These factors (size, complexity, many public methods, and diverse dependencies) justify decomposing the class into smaller, more focused modules."
