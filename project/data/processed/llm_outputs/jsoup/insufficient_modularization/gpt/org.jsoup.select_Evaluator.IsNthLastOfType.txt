    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal complexity: loc=19, nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metrics not applicable for decomposition. Given the lack of methods, fields, complexity, or dependencies, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
