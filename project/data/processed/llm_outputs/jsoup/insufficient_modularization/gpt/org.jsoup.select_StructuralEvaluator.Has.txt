    "class": "org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator.Has",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 50 LOC but 0 methods (loc=50, nom=0) and wmc=0, indicating substantial code volume without decomposed behavior. It declares fields (nof=2) but no methods to encapsulate functionality, and has no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggesting a self-contained, monolithic unit. These factors point to Insufficient Modularization: the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and improve modularity."
