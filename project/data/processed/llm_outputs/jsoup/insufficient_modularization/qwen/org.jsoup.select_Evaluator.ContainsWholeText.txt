    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 19 lines of code (loc=19). It has no dependencies (dependencies=[]), no fan-in or fan-out, and is at the root of the inheritance hierarchy (dit=1). The class is extremely simple with minimal complexity and size, showing no evidence of insufficient modularization as it represents a well-decomposed, focused component."
