{
    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.ControllableInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 17 methods (nom), 34 weighted methods (wmc), and 169 lines of code (loc). The high method count and weighted method complexity suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused components. Additionally, the class has 12 fields (nof) which further indicates it may be managing too much responsibility in a single class."
