{
    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods with a weighted method count (WMC) of 10, indicating moderate complexity. It contains nested classes (Cleaner.ElementMeta and Cleaner.CleaningVisitor) which suggests internal decomposition has already started but may be incomplete. The class has 133 lines of code and manages multiple dependencies (9 external classes), suggesting it handles various responsibilities that could potentially be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
