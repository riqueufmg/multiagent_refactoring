    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. With no methods or fields, there is no implementation complexity to decompose further. The class appears to be a simple, minimal implementation that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
