{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 773 lines of code (loc), 33 nested classes (nc), 24 fields (nof), and WMC of 11. The presence of 33 nested classes suggests insufficient decomposition, as these could potentially be extracted into separate classes. The high line count and numerous fields indicate the class is handling too much responsibility and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
