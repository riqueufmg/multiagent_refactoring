    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Safelist.Protocol",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (loc=8, wmc=0, nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0, nc=0) and no dependencies, indicating it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The small size and lack of methods or fields suggest this is likely a simple data class or enum that is appropriately modularized."
