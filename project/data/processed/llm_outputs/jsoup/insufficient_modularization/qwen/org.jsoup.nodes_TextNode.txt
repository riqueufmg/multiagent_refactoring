    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.TextNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 14 methods (nom) and 15 weighted method count (wmc), which is within acceptable limits for a single class. The lines of code (loc=92) is relatively small. While it has 10 public methods (nopm), the lack of fields (nof=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=2) suggests reasonable cohesion. The class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
