    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 22 lines of code, depth of inheritance of 2, and no methods or fields. The metrics indicate a simple, well-contained class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would require further decomposition."
