    "justification": "The class has moderate size (87 LOC, 9 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=11). While it has some nested classes (Regex.Matcher) and dependencies, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
