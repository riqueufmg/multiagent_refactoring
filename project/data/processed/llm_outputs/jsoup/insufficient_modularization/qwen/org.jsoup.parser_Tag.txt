{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Tag",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 32 methods (nom=32) and 307 lines of code (loc=307), which while substantial, does not indicate insufficient modularization given its likely cohesive purpose as a Tag representation. The low LCOM value (0.0625) suggests high cohesion within the class, and the low number of fields (nof=14) indicates it's not a god class accumulating unrelated responsibilities. The WMC of 39 shows moderate complexity but is not excessive for a class of this size and responsibility."
