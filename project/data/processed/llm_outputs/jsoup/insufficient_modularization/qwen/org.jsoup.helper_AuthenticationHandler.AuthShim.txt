    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.AuthenticationHandler.AuthShim",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating it is already minimally implemented. There are no fields or methods to decompose further, and the low complexity metrics (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0) suggest insufficient data to indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple inner class that is already sufficiently modularized given its minimal implementation."
