    "class": "org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator.Root",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 11 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and a depth of inheritance of 1. The metrics indicate minimal functionality and simple structure, suggesting the class is already sufficiently decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
