    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.Matches",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 21 lines of code, 1 field, and 0 methods. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT is 1 showing no deep inheritance. While it has a dependency on Regex helper, the class itself is already sufficiently decomposed given its minimal size and complexity."
