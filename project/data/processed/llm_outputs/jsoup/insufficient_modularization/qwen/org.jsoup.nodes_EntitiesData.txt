    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.EntitiesData",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, 13 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder with no complex behavior that would benefit from modularization."
