{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.RequestExecutor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom), 4 weighted method count (wmc), 14 lines of code (loc), and 2 fields (nof). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, lcom=1.0) indicates it is already well modularized. The class size and complexity metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization."
