{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.AttributeKeyPair",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 24 lines of code (loc=24), and a depth of inheritance of 1 (dit=1). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or value object with no significant functionality to decompose."
