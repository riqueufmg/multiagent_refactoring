```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 30 methods (nom=30) and 19 public methods (nopm=19), with a high Weighted Method Count of 53 (wmc=53). The Lines of Code at 272 (loc=272) indicates a large class size. The class also has high dependencies with 9 imported classes, suggesting it may be taking on too many responsibilities. These metrics collectively indicate that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
