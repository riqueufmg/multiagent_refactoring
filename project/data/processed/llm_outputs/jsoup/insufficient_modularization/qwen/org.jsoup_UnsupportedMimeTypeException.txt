    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4), low lines of code (loc=21), and simple structure (wmc=4). All methods are public and there are no fields (nof=2, nopf=0), indicating a well-focused, single-responsibility class that does not require further decomposition."
