    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (73 LOC, 6 methods) and complexity (WMC=16). While it has 3 fields and depends on 3 other classes, the metrics do not indicate excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to have a single responsibility as suggested by its name and reasonable method count."
