{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Selector",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) with 10 public methods (nopm=10), 161 lines of code (loc=161), and weighted method count of 19 (wmc=19). While the class has moderate complexity, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would clearly warrant further decomposition. The class appears to have reasonable cohesion and manageable complexity for its functionality."
