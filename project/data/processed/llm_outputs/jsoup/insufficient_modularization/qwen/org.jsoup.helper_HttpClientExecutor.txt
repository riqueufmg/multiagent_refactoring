    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with WMC of 21 and 7 methods, LOC of 132 is reasonable for a single class, LCOM of 0.429 indicates good cohesion, and DIT of 1 shows it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
