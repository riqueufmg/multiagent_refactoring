    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (3 private), 50 lines of code, and WMC of 7. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the small number of fields (3) and methods suggest appropriate modularization. The class appears to be well-decomposed for its current functionality."
