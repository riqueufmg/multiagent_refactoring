{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token.Doctype",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 fields, 0 methods, and 37 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies other than a single reference to TokenData. The class appears to be a simple data holder or nested class within the Token hierarchy, and its size and complexity are appropriate for its likely purpose."
