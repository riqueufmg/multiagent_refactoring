    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilderState.Constants",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 39 fields and 41 lines of code, with no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). While it contains a large number of constants, this appears to be its intended purpose as a constants container. The lack of methods and low complexity metrics indicate it is appropriately focused on a single responsibility of holding constants. No further decomposition would provide significant benefit given its simple structure and isolated nature."
