    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 45 lines of code (loc=45), and no method complexity (wmc=0). While the class has a relatively high number of lines for its method count, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or visitor implementation with minimal functionality that does not exceed reasonable modularization boundaries."
