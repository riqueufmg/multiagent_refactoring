{
    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable.BaseAppendable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 27 lines of code (loc=27), and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or base class with minimal implementation complexity."
