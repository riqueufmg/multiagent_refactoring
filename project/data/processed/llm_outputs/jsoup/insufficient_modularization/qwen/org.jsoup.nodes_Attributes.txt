{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 48 methods (nom=48) with 33 private methods (nopm=33), indicating high implementation complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=99) is very high, suggesting the class is doing too much work. With 522 lines of code (loc=522) and 14 fields (nof=14), the class is large and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high number of dependencies (9 external classes) further indicates that this class is handling multiple responsibilities that could be separated into distinct modules."
