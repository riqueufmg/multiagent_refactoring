{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Range",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 10 public methods (nopm=10), with a Weighted Method Count of 16 (wmc=16), indicating high complexity. The class contains 202 lines of code (loc=202) which is substantial for a single class. It also has dependencies on nested classes (Range.Position, Range.AttributeRange) and external classes (Node), suggesting it may be handling multiple responsibilities. The high method count, substantial LOC, and multiple dependencies indicate that this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
