{
    "class": "org.jsoup.Jsoup",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom=24) with 23 being public (nopm=23), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 25, which is relatively high. The class serves as a facade with multiple static methods for different functionalities (parsing, connecting, cleaning), suggesting it could be decomposed into specialized classes. The high method count and diverse dependencies (7 different classes) indicate it handles multiple concerns that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
