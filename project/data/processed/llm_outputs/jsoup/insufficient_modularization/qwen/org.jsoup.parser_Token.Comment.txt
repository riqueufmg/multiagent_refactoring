    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token.Comment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, 27 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or nested class within the Token hierarchy."
