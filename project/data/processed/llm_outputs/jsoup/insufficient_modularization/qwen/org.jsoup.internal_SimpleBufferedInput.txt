    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.SimpleBufferedInput",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods with a WMC of 34, which indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would suggest insufficient modularization. The class has 120 lines of code, which is reasonable for a single class. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the absence of inheritance (DIT=0) and low number of fields (NOF=7) suggest proper decomposition. The fanin and fanout values of 0 may indicate limited usage or testing context rather than a modularization issue."
