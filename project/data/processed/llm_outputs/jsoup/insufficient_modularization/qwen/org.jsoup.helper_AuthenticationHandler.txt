{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.AuthenticationHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 63 lines of code (loc=63), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low complexity. The lack of fields (nof=5, nopf=0) and simple dependency structure with only 2 dependencies indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
