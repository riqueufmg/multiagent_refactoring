{
    "class": "org.jsoup.Connection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 43 methods (nom=43) and 772 lines of code (loc=772), indicating high size and complexity. It also has multiple responsibilities as evidenced by its dependencies on various types including Document, Request, Response, KeyVal, RequestAuthenticator, Progress, Parser, and Method, suggesting it handles connection management, request/response processing, authentication, and parsing. The high method count and diverse dependencies indicate insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused modules."
