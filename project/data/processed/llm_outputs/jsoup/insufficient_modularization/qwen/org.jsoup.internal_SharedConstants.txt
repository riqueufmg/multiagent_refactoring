    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.SharedConstants",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 10 fields (nof=10), with very low complexity (loc=17). The low number of methods and minimal complexity indicate it is already well modularized. LCOM=0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates it's not overly connected to other components."
