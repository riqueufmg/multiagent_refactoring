    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.MatchesOwn",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 21 lines of code, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=1), and no inheritance depth (dit=1). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nom=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that doesn't require further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or utility class with insufficient complexity to warrant modularization concerns."
