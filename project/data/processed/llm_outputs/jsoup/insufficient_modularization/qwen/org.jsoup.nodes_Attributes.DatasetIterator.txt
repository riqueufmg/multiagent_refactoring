    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes.DatasetIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 17 lines of code (loc=17), which indicates a very small and simple class that does not require further decomposition. The low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) confirm that the class is already sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
