    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 75 methods (nom), 409 weighted method count (wmc), and 1386 lines of code (loc). The high number of methods and lines of code suggest the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
