    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.IsOnlyOfType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and Depth of Inheritance Tree is 1 (dit=1), indicating minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, well-encapsulated component with no signs of insufficient modularization."
