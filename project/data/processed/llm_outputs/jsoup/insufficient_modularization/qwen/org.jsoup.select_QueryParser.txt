{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.QueryParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 31 methods (nom), 111 weighted methods per class (wmc), and 341 lines of code (loc). The high method count and complexity suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused modules. With 10 dependencies and only 8 fields, the class appears to be doing too much work and could be further modularized to reduce size and implementation complexity."
