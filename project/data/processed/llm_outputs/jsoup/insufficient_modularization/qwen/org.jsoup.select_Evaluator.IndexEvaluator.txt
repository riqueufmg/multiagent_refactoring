    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 10 lines of code (loc=10), and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
