{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.CombiningEvaluator.And",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 25 lines of code (loc=25). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The Depth of Inheritance Tree is 2 (dit=2) which is reasonable. There are no dependencies (dependencies=[]), suggesting good separation of concerns. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
