{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.StreamParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18) and 259 lines of code (loc=259), indicating high size and complexity. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 19, which is high. The class also has 9 fields (nof=9) and depends on 8 external classes, suggesting it has multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
