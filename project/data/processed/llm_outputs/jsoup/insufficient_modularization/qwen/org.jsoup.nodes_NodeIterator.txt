```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.NodeIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods and WMC of 21, but the LCOM value of 0.25 indicates good cohesion. With only 84 lines of code and 6 fields, the class is relatively small and manageable. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies suggests it's not heavily coupled. While there are 6 public methods, the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
