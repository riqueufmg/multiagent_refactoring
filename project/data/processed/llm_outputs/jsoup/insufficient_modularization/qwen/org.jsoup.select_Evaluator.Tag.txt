{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.Tag",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 18 lines of code (loc=18), and a depth of inheritance of 1 (dit=1). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates it is likely a simple data holder or marker class that does not require further decomposition. Its small size and minimal complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization."
