```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.DocumentType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods (nom), 17 weighted method count (wmc), and 73 lines of code (loc). The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.222) indicates good internal cohesion. With only 6 fields and 2 public fields, the class is relatively small and well-organized. The absence of fanin and fanout suggests limited external dependencies. While there's room for decomposition, the current modularization appears sufficient given the class size and complexity metrics."
