{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.ValidationException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 2 public methods (nopm=2), with low complexity (wmc=4). The lines of code (loc=20) indicate a very small class that is appropriately sized. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 1 public field (nopf=1), the class shows proper encapsulation and minimal complexity. The LCOM value of 1.0 indicates good cohesion within the class. This level of complexity and size does not warrant further decomposition."
