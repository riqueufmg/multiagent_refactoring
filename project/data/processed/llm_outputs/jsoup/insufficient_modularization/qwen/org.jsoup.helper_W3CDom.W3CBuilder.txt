{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom.W3CBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 fields and 102 lines of code. It has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) indicating minimal implementation complexity. The class is not deeply inherited (dit=1) and has limited dependencies only to org.jsoup.nodes.Element. While it could potentially be decomposed further, the current size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it remains manageable and focused."
