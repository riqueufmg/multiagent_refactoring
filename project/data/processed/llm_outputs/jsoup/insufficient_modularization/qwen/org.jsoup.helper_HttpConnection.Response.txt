{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Response",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 388 lines of code (loc) which is excessively high for a single class, indicating it contains too much functionality. It has 15 fields (nof) which suggests it is managing too much state. The class has high complexity with multiple dependencies (6 dependencies) including org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection, org.jsoup.helper.AuthenticationHandler, org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil, org.jsoup.internal.ControllableInputStream, org.jsoup.Connection, and org.jsoup.helper.RequestExecutor, indicating it has too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
