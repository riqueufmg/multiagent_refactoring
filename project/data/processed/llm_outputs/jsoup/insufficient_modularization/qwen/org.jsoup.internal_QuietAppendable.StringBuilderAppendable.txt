    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 weighted method count, 0 methods, 0 fields, and only 24 lines of code. It appears to be a simple, well-focused inner class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The lack of methods and low LOC indicate it is already sufficiently decomposed rather than being a candidate for further breakdown."
