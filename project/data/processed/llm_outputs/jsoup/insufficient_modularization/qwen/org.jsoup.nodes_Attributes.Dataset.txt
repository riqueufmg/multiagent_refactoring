{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes.Dataset",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 43 lines of code (loc=43). It has minimal functionality with only 3 fields (nof=3, nopf=0) and no dependencies to other classes beyond its immediate context. The low method count and simple structure indicate it is already sufficiently decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
