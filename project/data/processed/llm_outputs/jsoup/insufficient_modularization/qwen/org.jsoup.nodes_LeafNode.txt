{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.LeafNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom) and 89 lines of code (loc), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc) is 25, indicating moderate complexity. The lack of cohesion metric (lcom) is 0.38, which suggests reasonable cohesion within the class. With only 1 field (nof) and 5 nested classes (nc), the class is not overly complex in terms of data structure. The depth of inheritance tree (dit) is 1, indicating no deep inheritance hierarchy. While the class has some complexity, it does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a well-contained, focused class with manageable size and complexity."
