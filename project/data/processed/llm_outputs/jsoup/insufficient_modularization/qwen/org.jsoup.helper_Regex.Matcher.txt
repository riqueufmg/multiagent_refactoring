    "justification": "The class has only 3 lines of code (loc=3) and all other metrics are 0 or minimal (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating it is already sufficiently small and simple. There are no dependencies, suggesting minimal complexity that would require further decomposition."
