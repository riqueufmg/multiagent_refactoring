    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.MatchText",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 28 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and minimal dependencies (only one dependency on ParseSettings). The low WMC (0), NC (0), and DIT (1) values indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple nature and limited functionality."
