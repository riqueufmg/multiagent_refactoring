{
    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Safelist",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 22 methods (nom), WMC of 54 indicating high computational complexity, 399 lines of code (loc), and 7 fields (nof). The class also has multiple nested static classes (Protocol, AttributeKey, AttributeValue, TagName) and dependencies on several other classes, suggesting it could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. The high WMC and nom values particularly indicate that the class has too many responsibilities and methods that could be better distributed across smaller, more focused classes."
