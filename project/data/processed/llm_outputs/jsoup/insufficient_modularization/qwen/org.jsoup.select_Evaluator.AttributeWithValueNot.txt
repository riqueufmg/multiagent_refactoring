    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 17 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). There are no fields or methods to decompose further, and the class appears to be a simple data class or placeholder. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already minimal in scope and implementation."
