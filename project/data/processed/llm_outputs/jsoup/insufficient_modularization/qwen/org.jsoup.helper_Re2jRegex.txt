    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4), 37 lines of code (loc=37), and 3 fields (nof=3). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates good cohesion. With only 3 methods and low complexity metrics, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
