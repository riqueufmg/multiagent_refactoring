    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.RequestDispatch",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1) and 29 lines of code (loc=29), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class-level dependencies (dit=0, nc=0), this class is already sufficiently modularized for its size and complexity. The lack of significant methods, fields, or complex dependencies indicates that further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits."
