    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Request",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 fields (nof=19) and 162 lines of code (loc=162), indicating high size and complexity for a single class. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests it may be a data-only class that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused components. The multiple dependencies (6 external classes) indicate it has complex relationships that could be better managed through proper modularization."
