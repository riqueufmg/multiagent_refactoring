    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.DataNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 5 public), low lines of code (46), low weighted method count (9), and low depth of inheritance (2). These metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would suggest insufficient modularization."
