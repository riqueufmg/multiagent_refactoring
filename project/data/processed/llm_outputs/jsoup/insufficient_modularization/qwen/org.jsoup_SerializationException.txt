    "class": "org.jsoup.SerializationException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 33 lines of code (loc=33), which indicates a small and simple class. With no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this appears to be a simple exception class that is already well modularized. The low WMC (4) and absence of complex relationships suggest sufficient modularization."
