    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 48 lines of code (loc=48), which indicates a small and focused class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=3), suggesting low complexity. The class appears to be properly modularized with a single, clear responsibility as indicated by its small size and low complexity metrics."
