```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.ParseSettings",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (70 LOC, 8 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=11). The LCOM value of 0.25 indicates good cohesion, suggesting the class is well-organized internally. With only 4 fields and 2 public fields, the class maintains a focused responsibility. The low number of methods and fields suggests it is already sufficiently decomposed for its current functionality."
