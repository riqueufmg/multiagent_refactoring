    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 23 lines of code, 1 field, and no methods. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond a simple import. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal functionality class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
