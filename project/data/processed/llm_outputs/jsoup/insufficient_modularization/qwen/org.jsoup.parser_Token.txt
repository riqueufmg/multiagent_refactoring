{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 20 methods (nom=20) and 397 lines of code (loc=397), indicating high size and complexity. It has 28 fields (nof=28) which is excessive. The class directly depends on 13 other classes, showing high coupling. The lack of public methods (nopm=0) combined with high method count suggests internal complexity that could be decomposed. LCOM value of 0.5 indicates moderate lack of cohesion, and the class appears to be managing multiple responsibilities as evidenced by its dependencies on various token types (Doctype, EndTag, StartTag, Comment, XmlDecl, Character) and parser components, suggesting it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
