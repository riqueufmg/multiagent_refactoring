{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Printer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) and 176 lines of code (loc=176), with a weighted method count of 14 (wmc=14). It also has 9 dependencies on other classes, indicating high complexity and responsibility. The class appears to handle printing logic for various node types but has not been decomposed into smaller, more focused classes, suggesting it could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
