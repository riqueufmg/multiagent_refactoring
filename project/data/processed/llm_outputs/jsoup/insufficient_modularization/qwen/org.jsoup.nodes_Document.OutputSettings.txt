    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Document.OutputSettings",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 157 lines of code (loc=157). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of fields, the lack of methods and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) indicate this is likely a simple data holder class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its purpose."
