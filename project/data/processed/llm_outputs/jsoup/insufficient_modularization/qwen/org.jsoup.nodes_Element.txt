{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Element",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 157 methods (nom=157) with 133 public methods (nopm=133), high weighted method count (wmc=241), and large lines of code (loc=1571). These metrics indicate high complexity and size that suggest insufficient modularization as the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its implementation complexity and size."
