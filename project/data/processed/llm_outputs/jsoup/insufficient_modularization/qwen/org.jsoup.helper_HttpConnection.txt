    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 48 methods (nom=48) with 44 private methods (nopm=44), indicating a high concentration of functionality within a single class. The large number of methods suggests the class is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition. Additionally, it has 56 fields (nof=56) with only 5 private fields (nopf=5), showing significant data complexity. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 58, which is high, and the LOC (Lines of Code) is 1021, making this a very large and complex class that would benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
