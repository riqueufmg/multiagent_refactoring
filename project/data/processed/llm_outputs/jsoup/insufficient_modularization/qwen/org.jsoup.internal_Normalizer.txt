{
    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4) and 30 lines of code (loc=30), which indicates a small and focused class. The class has no fields (nof=0) and all methods are public (nopm=4 equals nom=4). The low method count and small size suggest appropriate modularization without excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
