    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.TagStartsWith",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 15 lines of code, 1 field, and no methods. It does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already a simple, focused class with minimal responsibilities. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low WMC indicates it is not overly complex and does not require further decomposition."
