    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.IndexEquals",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and Number of Children is 0 (nc=0). While the class exists, its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, well-contained class with no evidence of needing further decomposition."
