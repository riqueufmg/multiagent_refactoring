    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 19 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0, nopm=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or value object that is already sufficiently decomposed. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is minimal in size and complexity."
