    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.Functions",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 24 lines of code (loc=24), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With 4 fields (nof=4) and 1.0 lack of cohesion (lcom=1.0), the class appears to be well-cohesive. The absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance (dit=0) suggests a simple, self-contained utility class that is appropriately modularized for its current functionality."
