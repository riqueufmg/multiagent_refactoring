    "class": "org.jsoup.select.CombiningEvaluator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods and WMC of 11, but LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion. With only 112 lines of code and 5 fields, the class size is reasonable. The low number of methods (7) and fields (5) suggests it is already well decomposed. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies indicate limited external coupling. The class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
