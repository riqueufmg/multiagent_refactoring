```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.NodeVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 26 lines of code (loc=26), which indicates a small and focused class. It has no fields (nof=0) and no public fields (nopf=0), suggesting proper encapsulation. The WMC of 3 indicates low complexity. The class appears to be properly modularized with a clear, single responsibility as suggested by its name and dependencies on Node and NodeTraversor, which indicates it's part of a well-defined traversal pattern rather than being insufficiently decomposed."
