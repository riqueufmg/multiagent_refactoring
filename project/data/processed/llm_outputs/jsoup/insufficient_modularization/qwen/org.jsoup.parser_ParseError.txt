    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 8 methods (nom=8), 3 fields (nof=3), and 52 lines of code (loc=52). The weighted method count is low (wmc=8) and there are no complex dependencies or inheritance hierarchy (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
