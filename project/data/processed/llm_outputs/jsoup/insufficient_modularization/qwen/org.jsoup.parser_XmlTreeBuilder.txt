{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 55 which is very high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 22 indicating too many responsibilities, LOC (Lines of Code) is 196 which is excessive for a single class, and LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) is 0.5 suggesting poor internal cohesion. The class also has 20 dependencies, further indicating it handles too many concerns and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
