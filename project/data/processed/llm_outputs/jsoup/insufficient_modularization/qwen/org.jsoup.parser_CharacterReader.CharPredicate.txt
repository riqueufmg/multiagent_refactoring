    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating it is already minimally implemented. There are no fields, methods, or complexity that would suggest insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-decomposed unit."
