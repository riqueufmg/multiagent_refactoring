    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3), 13 lines of code (loc=13), and 3 public methods (nopm=1 implies 2 non-public methods). The low number of methods and small size indicate sufficient modularization. No signs of insufficient decomposition are present."
