{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.CDataNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 24 lines of code (loc=24), which indicates a small and simple class. With 0 fields (nof=0) and only 2 dependencies, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit complexity that would require further modularization. The low method count and minimal dependencies suggest sufficient modularization has been achieved."
