    "class": "org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator.Has",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 50 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal method complexity, and there are no public methods or fields suggesting a simple data structure rather than a complex class requiring decomposition. The low DIT of 2 suggests it's not deeply inherited, and the minimal metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
