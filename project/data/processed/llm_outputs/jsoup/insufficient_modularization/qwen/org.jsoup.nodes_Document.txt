{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Document",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC=51 (high method complexity), NOM=31 (many methods), NOF=13 (many fields), LOC=447 (large class size). The class has 18 external dependencies suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. LCOM=0.3548387096774194 indicates moderate cohesion but the high number of methods and fields with only 27 public methods out of 31 total methods suggests the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
