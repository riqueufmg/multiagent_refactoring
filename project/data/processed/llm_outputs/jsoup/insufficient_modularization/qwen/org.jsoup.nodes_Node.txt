{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Node",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 79 methods (nom=79) with 59 public methods (nopm=59), indicating excessive functionality. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is high at 139 (wmc=139), suggesting high complexity. The class also has 766 lines of code (loc=766) and depends on 12 other classes, indicating it has too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
