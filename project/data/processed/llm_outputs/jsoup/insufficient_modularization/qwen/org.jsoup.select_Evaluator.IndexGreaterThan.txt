    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. With such minimal functionality and low size, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed and simple."
