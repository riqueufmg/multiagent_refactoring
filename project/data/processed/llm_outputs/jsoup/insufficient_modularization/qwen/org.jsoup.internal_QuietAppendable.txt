    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 63 lines of code (loc=63), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and 1 connected component (nc=2), the class is well-structured and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
