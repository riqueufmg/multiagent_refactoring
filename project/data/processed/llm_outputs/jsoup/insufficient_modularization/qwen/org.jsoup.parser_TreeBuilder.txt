```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 32 methods (nom), 56 weighted methods count (wmc), 263 lines of code (loc), and 13 fields (nof). The class also has a low LCOM value of 0.1875 suggesting cohesive behavior but the sheer size and method count indicate it should be further decomposed. Additionally, it has 16 dependencies which suggests it is handling multiple responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
