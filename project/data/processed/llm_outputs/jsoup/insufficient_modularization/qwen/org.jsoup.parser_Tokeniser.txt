    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 27 methods (nom), 59 weighted methods per class (wmc), and 244 lines of code (loc). The high method count and weighted method complexity suggest the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
