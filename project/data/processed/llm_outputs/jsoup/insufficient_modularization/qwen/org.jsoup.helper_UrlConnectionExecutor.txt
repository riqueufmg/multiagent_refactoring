    "justification": "The class has 6 methods with a WMC of 20, which indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. The LCOM value of 0.5 suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 86 lines of code and 1 class dependency, the class is relatively small and focused. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition."
