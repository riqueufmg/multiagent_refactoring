    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (57 LOC, 9 methods) and complexity (WMC=10). While it has 7 public methods which is relatively high for a small class, the low number of fields (0) and simple dependencies suggest it's appropriately modularized for its functionality. No clear indication of incomplete decomposition."
