{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.AttributeWithValueMatching",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 23 lines of code (loc=23). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal dependencies (only one dependency on org.jsoup.helper.Regex) indicate this is likely a simple data class or minimal implementation that does not warrant further decomposition. The low size and complexity metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization."
