{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 19 methods (nom), 49 weighted method count (wmc), 316 lines of code (loc), and 10 fields (nof). The high WMC suggests complex method implementations, while the large number of methods and lines of code indicate the class has not been fully decomposed into smaller, more manageable components. The class also has significant dependencies (14 external classes) which further supports the need for better modularization to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
