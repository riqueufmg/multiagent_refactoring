    "class": "org.jsoup.select.NodeTraversor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high implementation complexity as indicated by WMC of 32 with only 4 methods, suggesting methods are overly complex. The LOC of 124 is relatively high for a class with only 4 methods, indicating potential insufficient decomposition. The class has 5 dependencies but no fields or constructors, suggesting it may be doing too much coordination work that could be better decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
