    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 3 fields (nof=3), and 68 lines of code (loc=68). The low method count and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or utility class with minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
