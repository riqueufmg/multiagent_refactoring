    "class": "org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator.Not",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While it's a nested class (dit=2), its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization - it appears to be a simple, well-contained class with no signs of needing further decomposition."
