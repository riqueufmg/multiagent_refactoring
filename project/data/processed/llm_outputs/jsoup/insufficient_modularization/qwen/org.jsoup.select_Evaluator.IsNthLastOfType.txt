    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.IsNthLastOfType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 19 lines of code (loc=19). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion. Given the extremely small size and low complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed and minimal in nature."
