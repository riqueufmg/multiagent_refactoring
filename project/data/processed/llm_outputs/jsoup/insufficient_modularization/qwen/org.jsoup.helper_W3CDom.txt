```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18) and 343 lines of code (loc=343), indicating high size and complexity. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 28, which is high. The class also has 12 fields (nof=12) and multiple dependencies (7 external classes), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The high LCOM value (0.444) indicates poor cohesion, meaning the class likely contains methods and fields that don't belong together and could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
