{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Elements",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 60 methods (nom=60) with 58 public methods (nopm=58), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The weighted method count (wmc=98) is significantly high, suggesting complex implementation. The class has 557 lines of code (loc=557) which is substantial for a single class. The class depends on 7 different external classes, indicating it handles multiple concerns. These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
