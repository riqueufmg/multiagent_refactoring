    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Range.Position",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 64 lines of code. The lack of methods (nom=0, wmc=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
