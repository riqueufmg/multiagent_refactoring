    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 145 lines of code (loc=145). While the class has a moderate amount of code, the low number of fields and absence of methods suggest it may be serving a simple data structure or configuration role. Without evidence of high complexity, numerous responsibilities, or clear decomposition opportunities, insufficient modularization cannot be confidently detected based on the provided metrics alone."
