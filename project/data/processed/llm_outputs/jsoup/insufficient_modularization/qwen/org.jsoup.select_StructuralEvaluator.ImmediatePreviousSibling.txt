    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 16 lines of code, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), and minimal structural complexity (dit=2). There are no dependencies or coupling metrics indicating insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed given its minimal functionality."
