    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.IsLastOfType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 8 lines of code (loc=8). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and fan-in/fan-out are both 0, indicating minimal functionality. Given its extremely simple structure and low complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it appears to be a minimal, well-decomposed unit."
