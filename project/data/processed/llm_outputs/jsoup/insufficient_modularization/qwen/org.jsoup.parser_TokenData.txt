    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=19, LOC=77, NOM=10) and only one external dependency. The LCOM value of 0.2 indicates good cohesion. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed."
