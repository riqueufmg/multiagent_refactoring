{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.CombiningEvaluator.Or",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 35 lines of code (loc=35). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). This indicates a very simple class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed and has minimal implementation complexity."
