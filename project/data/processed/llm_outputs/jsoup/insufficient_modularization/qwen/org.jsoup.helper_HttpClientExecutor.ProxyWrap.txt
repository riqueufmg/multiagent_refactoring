    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpClientExecutor.ProxyWrap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity (WMC=0, NOM=0), minimal size (LOC=23), no fields or methods, and no dependencies. While the class exists, its minimal implementation and low complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple wrapper or placeholder class that has not grown beyond its basic purpose."
