{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.FormElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with WMC of 20 and 7 methods, LOC is 96 which is reasonable for a single class. The LCOM value of 0.4285714285714285 indicates reasonable cohesion. While the class has 12 dependencies, this is not excessive for a class that handles form elements and their interactions. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition."
