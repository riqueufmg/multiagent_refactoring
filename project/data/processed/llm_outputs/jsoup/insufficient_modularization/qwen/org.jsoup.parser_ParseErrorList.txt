{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.ParseErrorList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 7 methods (nom), 36 lines of code (loc), and a low weighted method count (wmc) of 7. The lack of fields (nof=3) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.4285714285714285) suggest reasonable internal structure. The absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates isolation but not necessarily insufficient modularization. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate the need for further decomposition."
