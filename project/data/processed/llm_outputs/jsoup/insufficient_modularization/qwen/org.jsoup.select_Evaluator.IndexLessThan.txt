    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). It appears to be a simple, well-focused class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
