    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 17 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). The lack of methods and minimal size indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. There are no signs of complex implementation that would benefit from further decomposition."
