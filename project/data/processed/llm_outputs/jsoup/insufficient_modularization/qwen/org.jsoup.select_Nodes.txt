```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Nodes",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 26 methods (nom=26, nopm=26) and 247 lines of code (loc=247), with a weighted method count of 38 (wmc=38). The high number of methods and lines of code indicates the class is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The class has only 1 direct dependency (nc=1) but this doesn't offset the excessive size and complexity. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) suggests it may be a utility-like class that has grown too large and should be split into more cohesive modules."
