```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilderState",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 45 methods (nom), 473 weighted method count (wmc), and 1735 lines of code (loc). The high number of methods and weighted method count suggest the class is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has numerous dependencies (15 external classes) which further indicates it has too many responsibilities and should be broken down."
