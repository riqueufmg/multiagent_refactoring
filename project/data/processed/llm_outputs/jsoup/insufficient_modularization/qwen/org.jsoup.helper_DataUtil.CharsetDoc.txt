    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, 13 lines of code, and 0 weighted method complexity. While it could potentially be decomposed further, its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder with no implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
