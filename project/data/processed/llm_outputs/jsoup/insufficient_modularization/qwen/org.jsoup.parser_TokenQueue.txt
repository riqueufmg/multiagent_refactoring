{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 86 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 396 indicating a large class, NOM (Number of Methods) is 34 which is excessive for a single class, and NOF (Number of Fields) is 7 plus NOPF (Number of Public Fields) is 0 indicating significant internal state management. The high WMC value suggests the class has too many complex methods that should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
