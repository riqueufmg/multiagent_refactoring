    "class": "org.jsoup.HttpStatusException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 18 lines of code (loc=18), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-focused and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The lack of complexity and small size suggest it does not need further decomposition."
