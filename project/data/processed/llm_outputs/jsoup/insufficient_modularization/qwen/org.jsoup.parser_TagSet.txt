{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.TagSet",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 14 methods and WMC of 29, but the LCOM value of 0.14 indicates good cohesion. With only 167 lines of code and 4 fields, the class is reasonably sized. The low fanin/fanout (0/0) suggests limited external dependencies, and the absence of inheritance (DIT=0) indicates it's a standalone utility class. While further decomposition could theoretically be possible, the current modularization appears sufficient given the class's focused responsibility and manageable complexity metrics."
