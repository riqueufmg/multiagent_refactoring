    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (loc=12, wmc=0, nof=0, nom=0) and no dependencies, indicating it is already well-decomposed and minimal in size and complexity. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately sized and structured."
