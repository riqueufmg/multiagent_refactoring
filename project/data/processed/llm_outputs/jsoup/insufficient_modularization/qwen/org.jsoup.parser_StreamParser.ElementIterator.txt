{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.StreamParser.ElementIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields and 0 methods, WMC of 0, and LOC of 66. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low field count (nof=4) indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or iterator implementation with limited responsibilities."
