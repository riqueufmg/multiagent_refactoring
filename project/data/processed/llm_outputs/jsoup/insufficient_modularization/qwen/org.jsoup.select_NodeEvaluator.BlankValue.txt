    "class": "org.jsoup.select.NodeEvaluator.BlankValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT of 2 suggests proper inheritance depth. With minimal functionality and low complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already appropriately decomposed for its limited responsibilities."
