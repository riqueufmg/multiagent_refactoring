    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Entities",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 21 methods (nom), 59 weighted methods per class (wmc), 299 lines of code (loc), and 18 fields (nof). The high number of methods and fields in a single class, combined with substantial lines of code, suggests that this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
