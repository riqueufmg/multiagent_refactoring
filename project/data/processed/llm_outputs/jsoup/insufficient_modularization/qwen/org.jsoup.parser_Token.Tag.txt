{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token.Tag",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 145 lines of code (loc) and 14 fields (nof), indicating high size and complexity for a single class. The class directly depends on 6 other classes, suggesting it has multiple responsibilities. The lack of methods (nom=0) despite having fields and dependencies indicates insufficient decomposition of functionality, as it likely serves as a data holder with embedded logic that could be further modularized into separate cohesive units."
