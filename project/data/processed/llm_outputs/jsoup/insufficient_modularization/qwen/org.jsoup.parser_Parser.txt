{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Parser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 30 methods (nom=30) with a total of 298 lines of code (loc=298), indicating high size and complexity. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 33 (wmc=33), suggesting high implementation complexity. With 11 fields (nof=11) and 29 public methods (nopm=29), the class has a large interface that could benefit from decomposition. The high number of dependencies (10 external classes) indicates the class has multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
