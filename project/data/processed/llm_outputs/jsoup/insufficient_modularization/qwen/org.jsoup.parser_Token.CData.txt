    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 9 lines of code (loc=9). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods or fields, there is no meaningful decomposition possible to further reduce size or complexity."
