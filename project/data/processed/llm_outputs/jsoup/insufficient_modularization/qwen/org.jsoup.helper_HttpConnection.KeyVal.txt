    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.KeyVal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a low lines of code count (loc=56). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is a simple data holder or value object rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The low field count and absence of behavioral complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization."
