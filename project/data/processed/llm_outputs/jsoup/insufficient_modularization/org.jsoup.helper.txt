Contains or coordinates multiple nested concerns (Request, Response, KeyVal, Base) and depends on many different subsystems (parsing, cookie handling, executors, authentication). The size, breadth of dependencies and responsibilities indicates a concentrated, bloated abstraction that would benefit from further decomposition."
