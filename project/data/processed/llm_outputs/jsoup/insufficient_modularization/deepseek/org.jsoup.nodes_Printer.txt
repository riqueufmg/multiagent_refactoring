{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Printer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) and 176 lines of code (loc=176), indicating significant size and implementation complexity. It depends on 9 external classes, suggesting multiple responsibilities related to printing different node types (Element, TextNode, LeafNode) and handling formatting (StringUtil, Entities, QuietAppendable). The lack of decomposition is evident from the single class (nc=1) managing all these concerns."
