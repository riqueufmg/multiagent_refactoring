    "justification": "Class has only 4 methods, 26 lines of code, and 6 weighted methods complexity, which are low values indicating appropriate modularization. No fields suggest it's a pure handler class. LCOM of -1 indicates high method cohesion. No evidence of excessive size or complexity requiring further decomposition."
