    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.TokeniserState",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics (WMC=409, LOC=1386, NOM=75) indicating a large, monolithic implementation. The lack of child classes (NC=0, DIT=0) and absence of internal modularization via methods with parameters (NOPM=0) or fields (NOPF=0) suggest all logic is contained within a single class structure. The high method count and cyclomatic complexity imply the class handles multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, focused units."
