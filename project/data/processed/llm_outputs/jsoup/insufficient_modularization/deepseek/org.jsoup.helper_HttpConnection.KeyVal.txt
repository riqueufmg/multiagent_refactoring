    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 56 lines of code, which is small in size. It has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and shows no signs of high implementation complexity. The LCOM value of -1 indicates no cohesion issues. The class is already a simple data structure with minimal functionality."
