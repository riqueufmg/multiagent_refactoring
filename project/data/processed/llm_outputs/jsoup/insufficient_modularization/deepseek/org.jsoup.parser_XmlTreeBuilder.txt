    "justification": "Class has 22 methods (nom) and 55 weighted methods per class (wmc), indicating high implementation complexity. It has 196 lines of code (loc) and a lack of decomposition is suggested by 0 fan-in and 0 fan-out, meaning it does not delegate responsibilities to other classes. The moderate LCOM (0.5) suggests some cohesion, but the high method count and complexity show insufficient modularization."
