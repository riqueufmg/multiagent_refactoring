    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=24, WMC=5, NOM=5) and no dependencies, indicating it is already small and focused. The LCOM value of 1.0 suggests high cohesion, and the class appears to be a utility class with static methods, which is appropriately modularized for its purpose."
