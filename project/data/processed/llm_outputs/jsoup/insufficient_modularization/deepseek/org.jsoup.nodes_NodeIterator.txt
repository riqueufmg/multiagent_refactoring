    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=21, LOC=84), high cohesion (LCOM=0.25), and a focused responsibility (iterating over Nodes). The number of methods (8) and fields (6) is moderate, and it shows no clear signs of multiple responsibilities that would warrant further decomposition."
