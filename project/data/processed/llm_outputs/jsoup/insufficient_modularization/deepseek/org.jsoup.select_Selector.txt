{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Selector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) with 10 being public (nopm=10), indicating a high number of public methods potentially handling multiple responsibilities. The LOC (161) and WMC (19) suggest moderate size and complexity, but the high number of public methods relative to the class size suggests insufficient decomposition of functionality into smaller, more focused modules."
