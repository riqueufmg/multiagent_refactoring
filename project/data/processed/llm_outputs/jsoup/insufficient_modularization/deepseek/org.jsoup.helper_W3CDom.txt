    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: 18 methods (nom), 343 lines of code (loc), and 28 weighted methods per class (wmc). It contains 12 fields (nof) and shows moderate lack of cohesion (lcom: 0.44). The presence of 16 public methods (nopm) suggests multiple responsibilities. The class could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
