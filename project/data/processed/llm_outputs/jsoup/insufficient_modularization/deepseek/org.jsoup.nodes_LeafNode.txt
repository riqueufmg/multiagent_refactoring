    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.LeafNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=25, LOC=89, NC=5) and good cohesion (LCOM=0.38). It has a moderate number of methods (NOM=21) but half are public (NOPM=12), suggesting a focused interface. No dependencies indicate it's already a leaf component. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
