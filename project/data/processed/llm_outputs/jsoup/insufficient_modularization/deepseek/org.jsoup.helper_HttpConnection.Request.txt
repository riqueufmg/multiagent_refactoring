    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Request",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 fields (nof=19) and 162 lines of code (loc=162), indicating significant size and potential complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests all behavior is implemented elsewhere, likely in the enclosing class, which violates single responsibility and indicates insufficient decomposition."
