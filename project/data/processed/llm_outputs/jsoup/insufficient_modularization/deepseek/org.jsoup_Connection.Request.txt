    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely an interface or abstract type with no implementation to decompose. LOC=179 suggests documentation or declarations, not complex implementation. LCOM=-1.0 and WMC=0 confirm no method complexity. No dependencies indicate no hidden coupling. There is insufficient evidence of implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
