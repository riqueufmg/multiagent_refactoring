    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods with 6 public methods, 120 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 34, indicating significant implementation complexity. The presence of 7 fields suggests multiple responsibilities. The high method count and complexity relative to the size suggest insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused units."
