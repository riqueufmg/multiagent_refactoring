    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 4 public methods and 124 LOC with WMC of 32, indicating high implementation complexity. The class depends on multiple external types (NodeVisitor, NodeFilter, Elements, Validate, Node), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
