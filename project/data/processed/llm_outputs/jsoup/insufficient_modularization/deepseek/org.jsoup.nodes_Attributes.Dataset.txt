    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields, 0 methods, 43 LOC, and 0 WMC, indicating minimal size and complexity. It has no internal methods to decompose and shows low implementation complexity. The dependencies are limited to its parent class and a related class, suggesting it is already appropriately modularized as a simple data container."
