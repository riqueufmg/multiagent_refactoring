    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.AuthenticationHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods with 1 public method, 5 fields, and 63 lines of code, yet it contains an inner class (AuthShim) and depends on RequestAuthenticator, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities (authentication logic and shim implementation) that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes to reduce complexity."
