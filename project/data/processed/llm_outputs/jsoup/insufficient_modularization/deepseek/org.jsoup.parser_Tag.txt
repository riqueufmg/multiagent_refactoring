    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high complexity metrics (WMC=39, LOC=307, NOM=32) and many fields (NOF=14, NOPF=10) indicating it handles multiple responsibilities. Low LCOM (0.0625) suggests high cohesion, but the size and number of methods/fields exceed typical single-responsibility thresholds, suggesting insufficient decomposition despite cohesion."
