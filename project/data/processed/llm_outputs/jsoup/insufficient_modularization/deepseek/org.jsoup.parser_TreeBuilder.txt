    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder",

    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (263) and WMC (56) are substantial, and it has 32 methods (nom) with 13 fields (nof). The LCOM value (0.1875) indicates some cohesion, but the size and method count suggest the class is handling multiple responsibilities, which could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
