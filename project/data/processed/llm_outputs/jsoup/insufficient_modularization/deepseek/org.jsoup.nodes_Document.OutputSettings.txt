    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Document.OutputSettings",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields and 157 lines of code, which is not excessively large. It has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it is likely a simple data container or configuration class. The negative LCOM value suggests high cohesion. The dependencies are minimal and appropriate for its likely purpose. No clear indicators of insufficient modularization are present."
