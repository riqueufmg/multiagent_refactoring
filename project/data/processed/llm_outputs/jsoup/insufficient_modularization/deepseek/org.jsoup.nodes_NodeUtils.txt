    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.NodeUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 5 methods (nom=5) but 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is a utility class with only static methods. Its LCOM value of -1.0 suggests high cohesion, but the class aggregates multiple unrelated functionalities (Node iteration, Document conversion, W3C DOM conversion, Element filtering, and parsing) that could be separated into more focused utility classes to reduce its implementation complexity and improve modularity."
