{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.TagSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 167 lines of code (loc=167), indicating a large and potentially complex implementation. The weighted method count (wmc=29) is high, suggesting significant complexity. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.14) indicates the methods are highly related, but the size and complexity metrics suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes or helper methods to reduce its overall size and implementation complexity."
