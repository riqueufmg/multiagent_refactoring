    "justification": "High method count (nom=34) and complexity (wmc=86) indicate a large, complex class. Low cohesion (lcom=0.0588) suggests methods are loosely related, and the class has multiple responsibilities. The size (loc=396) and number of methods exceed typical modular class thresholds, suggesting further decomposition could reduce implementation complexity."
