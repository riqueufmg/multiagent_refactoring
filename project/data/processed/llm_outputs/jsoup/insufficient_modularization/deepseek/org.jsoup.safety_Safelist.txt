{
    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Safelist",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (399) and WMC (54) are high, indicating a large and complex class. It has 22 methods (nom) with only 2 non-public methods, suggesting many public methods in one class. The presence of multiple inner classes (Protocol, TagName, AttributeValue, AttributeKey) within the main class suggests insufficient decomposition of related concepts."
