    "justification": "The class has 3 methods (nom=3) and 96 lines of code (loc=96), indicating a moderate size and complexity concentrated in a single class. The presence of an inner class (FormattingVisitor) suggests a responsibility that could be further decomposed into separate classes to reduce implementation complexity and improve modularity."
