    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.Regex",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 5 public methods (nopm=5) and a weighted method complexity of 11 (wmc=11), indicating moderate implementation complexity. The presence of an inner class dependency (Regex.Matcher) and an external helper class (Re2jRegex) suggests responsibilities that could be further decomposed into separate, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
