    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.StreamParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 18 methods (nom=18) and 259 lines of code (loc=259), indicating significant size and implementation complexity. The presence of an inner class (StreamParser.ElementIterator) suggests multiple responsibilities. High method count and substantial code volume suggest insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
