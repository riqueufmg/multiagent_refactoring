    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Element",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (1571), WMC (241), and number of methods (157) are very large, indicating a significant implementation burden. The LCOM value (0.34) suggests moderate cohesion, and the class has many dependencies (28), which together imply the class is handling multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
