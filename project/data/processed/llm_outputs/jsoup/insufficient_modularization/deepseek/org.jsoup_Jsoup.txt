    "class": "org.jsoup.Jsoup",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (23 public) with 269 lines of code and a weighted method complexity of 25, indicating a large, complex class that could be decomposed. It has 0 fields, suggesting it is a utility class with many static methods, which is a common indicator of insufficient modularization where responsibilities could be split into smaller, more focused classes."
