    "justification": "Class has 7 methods (nom=7) with 112 lines of code (loc=112) and 5 fields (nof=5), indicating significant implementation complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=11) suggests high method complexity. The class could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity, as evidenced by multiple methods and fields handling combined evaluator logic."
