    "justification": "The class has high metrics indicating excessive size and complexity: LOC (1735), WMC (473), and number of methods (45). The high LCOM (0.49) suggests low cohesion, and the class has 41 fields, indicating it likely handles multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
