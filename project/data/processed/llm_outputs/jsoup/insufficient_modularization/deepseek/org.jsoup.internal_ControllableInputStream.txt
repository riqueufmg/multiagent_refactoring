    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.ControllableInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high complexity (WMC=34, LOC=169, 17 methods) with 12 fields, indicating multiple responsibilities. Low LCOM (0.176) suggests high cohesion, but the combination of many fields and methods suggests the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce implementation complexity."
