  "justification": "The analyzed package has a stability (Ca/(Ca+Ce)) of 2/(2+5)=0.286. All outgoing dependencies have higher stability values: org.jsoup.internal (5/(5+4)=0.556), org.jsoup (7/(7+4)=0.636), org.jsoup.nodes (7/(7+5)=0.583), org.jsoup.parser (6/(6+6)=0.500), org.jsoup.helper (7/(7+5)=0.583). Therefore, no dependency is less stable than the analyzed package, satisfying the Stable Dependencies Principle."
