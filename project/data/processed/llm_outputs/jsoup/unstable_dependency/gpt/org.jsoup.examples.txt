"justification": "org.jsoup.examples has Ce=4 and Ca=0 (Instability I = 4/(4+0) = 1.0). Its outgoing dependencies are: org.jsoup.nodes (Ce=5, Ca=7, I = 5/12 ≈ 0.4167), org.jsoup.helper (Ce=5, Ca=7, I ≈ 0.4167), org.jsoup.select (Ce=5, Ca=4, I = 5/9 ≈ 0.5556), and org.jsoup (Ce=4, Ca=7, I = 4/11 ≈ 0.3636). All dependent packages have lower instability values (are more stable) than org.jsoup.examples, so the package depends on more stable components and follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. There are no incoming dependencies to org.jsoup.examples. Therefore an Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
