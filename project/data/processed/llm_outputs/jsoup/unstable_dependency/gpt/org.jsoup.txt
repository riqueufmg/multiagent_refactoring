"justification": "org.jsoup has Ce=4 and Ca=7 -> Instability I = 4/(4+7) = 0.364. All outgoing dependencies are less stable (higher I) than org.jsoup: org.jsoup.safety (Ce=5, Ca=2 -> I=5/7=0.714), org.jsoup.nodes (Ce=5, Ca=7 -> I=5/12=0.417), org.jsoup.helper (Ce=5, Ca=7 -> I=0.417), org.jsoup.parser (Ce=6, Ca=6 -> I=6/12=0.5). Because org.jsoup depends on packages with higher instability than itself, it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle and exhibits the Unstable Dependency smell."
