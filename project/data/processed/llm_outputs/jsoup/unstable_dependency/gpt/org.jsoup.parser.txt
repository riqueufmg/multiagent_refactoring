"package": "org.jsoup.parser",
"detection": true,
"justification": "org.jsoup.parser has Ce=6 and Ca=6 (Instability I = 6/(6+6) = 0.500). Among its outgoing dependencies, org.jsoup.select (Ce=5, Ca=4, I = 5/(5+4) = 0.556) and org.jsoup.safety (Ce=5, Ca=2, I = 5/(5+2) = 0.714) have higher instability than org.jsoup.parser. Depending on these less-stable packages violates the Stable Dependencies Principle. (Other outgoing dependencies: org.jsoup.internal I=0.444, org.jsoup I=0.364, org.jsoup.helper I=0.417, org.jsoup.nodes I=0.417 are more stable.) Therefore an Unstable Dependency smell is detected for org.jsoup.parser."
