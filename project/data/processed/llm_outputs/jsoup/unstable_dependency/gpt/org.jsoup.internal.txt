"package": "org.jsoup.internal",
"detection": true,
"justification": "org.jsoup.internal has Ce=4, Ca=5 -> instability I = 4/(4+5) = 0.444. Among its outgoing dependencies: org.jsoup.parser (Ce=6, Ca=6 -> I=6/(6+6)=0.500), org.jsoup.nodes (I≈0.417), org.jsoup.helper (I≈0.417), org.jsoup (I≈0.364). Because org.jsoup.internal depends on org.jsoup.parser which has a higher instability (0.500 > 0.444), org.jsoup.internal depends on a less stable package, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle and indicating an Unstable Dependency smell."
