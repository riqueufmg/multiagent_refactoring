All outgoing dependencies have stability values greater than or equal to org.jsoup.nodes' stability: org.jsoup.internal (0.308), org.jsoup (0.222), org.jsoup.helper (0.263), org.jsoup.select (0.385), and org.jsoup.parser (0.545). Since org.jsoup.nodes only depends on packages that are more stable than itself, it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
