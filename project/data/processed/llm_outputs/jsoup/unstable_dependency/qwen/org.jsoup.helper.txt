For 'org.jsoup.helper', stability is 5/(5+7) = 0.4167. Its dependency 'org.jsoup.parser' has stability 6/(6+6) = 0.5, and 'org.jsoup.select' has stability 5/(5+4) = 0.5556. Both values are higher than the stability of 'org.jsoup.helper', indicating it depends on less stable packages, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
