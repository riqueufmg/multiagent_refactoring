{
"package": "org.jsoup.parser",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'org.jsoup.parser' has a stability value of 0.167 (Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 6/(6+6)), and it depends on packages 'org.jsoup.helper' (stability = 0.417), 'org.jsoup.nodes' (stability = 0.417), and 'org.jsoup.select' (stability = 0.556), which are less stable than itself. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
