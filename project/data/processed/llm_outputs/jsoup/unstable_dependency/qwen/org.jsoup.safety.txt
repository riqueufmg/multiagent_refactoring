"package": "org.jsoup.safety",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package org.jsoup.safety has a stability value of 0.36 (Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 5/(2+5)) and depends on packages with higher stability: org.jsoup.internal (0.44), org.jsoup (0.36), org.jsoup.helper (0.42), org.jsoup.nodes (0.42), and org.jsoup.parser (0.50). However, it also depends on org.jsoup (0.36) which has the same stability, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle as it should only depend on more stable packages. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from org.jsoup.parser which is more stable (0.50 > 0.36), creating an unstable dependency relationship."
