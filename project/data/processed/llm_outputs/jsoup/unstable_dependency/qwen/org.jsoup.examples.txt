"package": "org.jsoup.examples",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.jsoup.examples' has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0) and depends only on packages 'org.jsoup.select', 'org.jsoup.nodes', 'org.jsoup', and 'org.jsoup.helper'. These dependencies are all more stable than 'org.jsoup.examples' as they have higher Ca values (4, 7, 7, 7 respectively) and lower Ce/Ca ratios, indicating greater stability. Therefore, it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle."
