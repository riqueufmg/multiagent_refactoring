"package": "org.jsoup",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.jsoup has a stability metric (I) of 0.636, calculated as Ca/(Ca+Ce) = 7/(7+4). Its outgoing dependencies are to packages org.jsoup.parser (I=0.5), org.jsoup.nodes (I=0.593), org.jsoup.safety (I=0.286), and org.jsoup.helper (I=0.222). All these dependencies have lower instability values than org.jsoup, meaning org.jsoup depends on more stable packages. Therefore, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
