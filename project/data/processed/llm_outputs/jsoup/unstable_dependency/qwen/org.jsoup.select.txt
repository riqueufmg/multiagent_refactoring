{
"package": "org.jsoup.select",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'org.jsoup.select' has a stability value of 0.42 (Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 5/(4+5)). It depends on 'org.jsoup.helper' which has a stability value of 0.42 (5/(7+5)), 'org.jsoup.nodes' which has a stability value of 0.42 (5/(7+5)), and 'org.jsoup.parser' which has a stability value of 0.50 (6/(6+6)). Since 'org.jsoup.select' is depending on packages with equal or higher stability, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. However, it also depends on 'org.jsoup.helper' and 'org.jsoup.nodes' which have the same stability value as itself, indicating potential instability in dependency direction. More importantly, 'org.jsoup.select' is depended upon by 'org.jsoup.nodes' and 'org.jsoup.helper', both of which are more stable (higher Ca, lower Ce), creating an unstable dependency where less stable packages depend on more stable ones, violating the principle."
