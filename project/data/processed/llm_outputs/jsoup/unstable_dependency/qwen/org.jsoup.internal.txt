"package": "org.jsoup.internal",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'org.jsoup.internal' has a stability value of 0.24 (Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 4/(5+4)). It depends on 'org.jsoup.parser' (stability 0.50), 'org.jsoup' (stability 0.36), 'org.jsoup.helper' (stability 0.42), and 'org.jsoup.nodes' (stability 0.42). All these dependencies have higher stability values than 'org.jsoup.internal', which violates the Stable Dependencies Principle. A package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself, but here it depends on packages with greater stability, indicating an unstable dependency."
