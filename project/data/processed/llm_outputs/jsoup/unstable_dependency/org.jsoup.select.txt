"justification": "org.jsoup.select has Ce=5 and Ca=4 (instability I = 5/(4+5) = 0.556). Its outgoing dependencies have instabilities: org.jsoup.internal (Ce=4, Ca=5, I=0.444), org.jsoup (Ce=4, Ca=7, I=0.364), org.jsoup.helper (Ce=5, Ca=7, I=0.417), org.jsoup.parser (Ce=6, Ca=6, I=0.500), org.jsoup.nodes (Ce=5, Ca=7, I=0.417). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than org.jsoup.select, and incoming coupling (Ca=4) shows other packages depend on it. Because org.jsoup.select depends only on packages with lower instability, the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated; no Unstable Dependency smell detected."
