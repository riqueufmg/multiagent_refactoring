"justification": "Instability I = Ce / (Ce + Ca). org.jsoup.safety: Ce=5, Ca=2 => I=5/7 ≈ 0.714. Outgoing dependencies: org.jsoup.internal (Ce=4, Ca=5 => I≈0.444), org.jsoup (Ce=4, Ca=7 => I≈0.364), org.jsoup.helper (Ce=5, Ca=7 => I≈0.417), org.jsoup.parser (Ce=6, Ca=6 => I=0.5), org.jsoup.nodes (Ce=5, Ca=7 => I≈0.417). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than org.jsoup.safety (0.714), so the package depends on more stable packages (complies with the Stable Dependencies Principle). Incoming dependencies (org.jsoup I≈0.364, org.jsoup.parser I=0.5) are also more stable. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected for org.jsoup.safety."
