"justification": "org.jsoup.helper has Ce=5, Ca=7 => instability I=5/(5+7)=0.4167. Outgoing dependencies and their instabilities: org.jsoup.select (Ce=5, Ca=4 => I=5/9=0.5556), org.jsoup.internal (Ce=4, Ca=5 => I=4/9=0.4444), org.jsoup (Ce=4, Ca=7 => I=4/11=0.3636), org.jsoup.parser (Ce=6, Ca=6 => I=6/12=0.5000), org.jsoup.nodes (Ce=5, Ca=7 => I=5/12=0.4167). The Stable Dependencies Principle is violated for dependencies whose I > 0.4167: org.jsoup.select (0.5556), org.jsoup.internal (0.4444) and org.jsoup.parser (0.5000) are less stable than org.jsoup.helper, so org.jsoup.helper depends on less stable packages. Incoming dependencies (org.jsoup.examples, org.jsoup, org.jsoup.internal, org.jsoup.safety, org.jsoup.nodes, org.jsoup.select, org.jsoup.parser) include both more-stable and less-stable packages but do not mitigate the fact that multiple outgoing dependencies violate the stability direction. Therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
