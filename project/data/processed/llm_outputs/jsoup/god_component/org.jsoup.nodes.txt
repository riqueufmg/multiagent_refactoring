    "justification": "The package contains 34 classes and 5,498 LOC, indicating a very large component. Several individual classes are extremely large and complex (Element: 1,571 LOC, WMC 241, nom 157; Node: 766 LOC, WMC 139, nom 79; Attributes: 522 LOC, WMC 99, nom 48; Document: 447 LOC). Multiple other classes exceed typical single-class sizes (Range 202 LOC, Entities 299 LOC, Printer 176 LOC). High class sizes and high WMC values, combined with many cross-dependencies within the package, indicate concentrated responsibilities and complexity consistent with a God Component."
