    "justification": "Package contains 70 classes and 3822 LOC, which is excessively large for a single component. The Evaluator class alone hosts 33 inner classes and 773 LOC, and several other classes (Elements, QueryParser) are also large and complex. This indicates the package has taken on too many responsibilities."
