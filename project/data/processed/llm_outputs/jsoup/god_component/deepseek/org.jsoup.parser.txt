    "justification": "Package contains 30 classes and 7615 LOC, which is excessively large. Two classes (TokeniserState and HtmlTreeBuilderState) are particularly massive (1386 and 1735 LOC) and complex (WMC 409 and 473), indicating the package handles multiple parsing responsibilities and could be split."
