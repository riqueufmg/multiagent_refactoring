    "justification": "The package contains 13 classes with a total of 953 lines of code. While some classes like StringUtil (322 loc) and ControllableInputStream (169 loc) are relatively large, the overall distribution of functionality appears reasonable for an internal utility package. There is no single class or component that dominates the codebase excessively in terms of size or complexity."
