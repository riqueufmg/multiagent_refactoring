    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes with a total of 636 lines of code. The largest class, Safelist, has 399 lines of code and 22 methods, which is substantial but not excessively large given its role in defining safety rules for HTML cleaning. The other classes are significantly smaller, with most being under 20 lines of code. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable for a package handling HTML sanitization, without evidence of excessive centralization of functionality or responsibilities."
