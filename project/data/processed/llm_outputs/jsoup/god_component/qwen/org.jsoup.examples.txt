    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes with a total of 190 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, HtmlToPlainText, has 96 lines of code and a reasonable complexity (WMC=8). No single class dominates the package in terms of size or complexity, and the overall package structure appears to be a collection of example utilities rather than a monolithic component."
