    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.jsoup.safety",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package has 9 classes and 636 LOC, but one class (Safelist) contains 399 LOC (~63% of package LOC), 22 methods (nom), and high complexity (wmc 54). Safelist also defines several inner types (TagName, AttributeKey, AttributeValue, Protocol, TypedValue) indicating multiple responsibilities bundled into a single large class. The next largest class (Cleaner) is 133 LOC, substantially smaller. The concentration of size, methods and inner types in Safelist supports that a single component is excessively large relative to the package, consistent with the God Component smell."
