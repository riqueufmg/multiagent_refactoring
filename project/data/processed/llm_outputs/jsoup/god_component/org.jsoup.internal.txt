    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 13 classes with a total of 953 LOC and a broad set of responsibilities. Several classes are disproportionately large and complex: org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil (322 LOC, 26 methods, WMC 50) and org.jsoup.internal.ControllableInputStream (169 LOC, 17 methods, WMC 34) and org.jsoup.internal.SimpleBufferedInput (120 LOC, 11 methods, WMC 34). StringUtil in particular touches many subsystems (parser, nodes, helper classes) indicating mixed responsibilities and high cognitive load. The package also has multiple external dependencies, suggesting it is a central utility hub. These factors (high package LOC concentrated in a few complex classes, many methods and high complexity metrics, and wide dependency reach) support diagnosing a God Component."
