    "justification": "The package contains 11 classes and 1,585 LOC, but the size and responsibility are highly concentrated in a few classes. org.jsoup.Connection is 772 LOC (≈48.7% of package LOC) with 43 methods and WMC=43, and org.jsoup.Jsoup is 269 LOC with 24 methods (together these two classes account for ≈66% of the package LOC and most methods). This heavy concentration of code and complexity in a small subset of the package indicates an excessively large component (God Component) despite the modest class count."
