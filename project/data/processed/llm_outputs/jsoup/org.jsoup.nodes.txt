    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package org.jsoup.nodes is excessively large: 34 classes and 5,498 LOC. Several very large and complex classes concentrate most of the size and responsibility (Element: 1,571 LOC, NOM 157, WMC 241; Node: 766 LOC, NOM 79, WMC 139; Attributes: 522 LOC, NOM 48, WMC 99; Document: 447 LOC). These high LOC and complexity metrics indicate an aggregation of functionality that exceeds typical component size and single-responsibility expectations, matching the God Component smell."
