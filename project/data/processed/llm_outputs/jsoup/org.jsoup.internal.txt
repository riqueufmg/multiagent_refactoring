    "justification": "The package contains 13 classes and 953 LOC, which is large for a single component (classes > 10 and LOC ~953). Several classes are very large and complex: StringUtil (322 LOC, WMC 50, 26 members), ControllableInputStream (169 LOC, WMC 34, 17 methods), and SimpleBufferedInput (120 LOC, WMC 34, 11 methods). Those three classes alone account for ~611 LOC (≈64% of the package), indicating concentration of size/complexity. High per-class WMC values and many members further support excessive responsibility concentrated in this package, consistent with the God Component smell."
