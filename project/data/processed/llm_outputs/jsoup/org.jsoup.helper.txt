    "justification": "The package org.jsoup.helper is excessively large: 29 classes and 3574 LOC. It contains several very large classes that concentrate functionality, e.g. HttpConnection (1021 LOC, 48 methods, WMC 58), HttpConnection.Response (388 LOC), W3CDom (343 LOC), DataUtil (316 LOC), and Validate (191 LOC). HttpConnection includes many nested types and a high number of methods, indicating multiple responsibilities. The combination of high total LOC, many classes and multiple very large classes supports the detection of a God Component in this package."
