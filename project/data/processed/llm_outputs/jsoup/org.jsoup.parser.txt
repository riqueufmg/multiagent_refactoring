    "justification": "The package org.jsoup.parser contains 30 classes and 7,615 LOC, which is very large for a single component. Several classes concentrate most of the size and complexity: HtmlTreeBuilderState (loc 1,735, wmc 473), TokeniserState (loc 1,386, wmc 409), HtmlTreeBuilder (loc 765, wmc 227), CharacterReader (loc 533, wmc 130), Token (loc 397), Parser (loc 298) and Tokeniser (loc 244). The presence of multiple very large classes with high WMC and LOC indicates that functionality and complexity are highly concentrated in this package, matching the God Component smell."
