    "justification": "The package org.jsoup.select is excessively large (70 classes, 3822 LOC). Several classes concentrate high size and complexity: Evaluator (loc 773, many inner evaluator types, nc 33), Elements (loc 557, nom 60, wmc 98), QueryParser (loc 341, wmc 111), Nodes (loc 247), StructuralEvaluator (loc 220). The presence of many large classes and high WMC values indicates a concentration of responsibilities and functionality in this single package, supporting detection of a God Component."
