    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.DiffBuilder) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionDiffBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing ties; these counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
