    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. In the provided data FailableBiConsumer has 0 outgoing dependencies and incoming dependencies from six classes: org.apache.commons.lang3.AppendableJoiner, org.apache.commons.lang3.AppendableJoiner.Builder, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.MethodInvokers, org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationUtils, and org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple.Pair. Because it has no outgoing dependencies (only incoming), it does not meet the requirement of having both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies and therefore is not detected as Hub-like Modularization."
