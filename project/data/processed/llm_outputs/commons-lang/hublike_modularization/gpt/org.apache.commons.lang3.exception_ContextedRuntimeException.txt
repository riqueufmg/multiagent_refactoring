    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. ContextedRuntimeException has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ExceptionContext, org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.DefaultExceptionContext) and has 0 incoming dependencies. The incoming dependency count is zero and the outgoing count is small, so it does not meet the hub-like modularization criteria."
