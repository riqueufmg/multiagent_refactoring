    "justification": "The class has a small number of dependencies: 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.EventCountCircuitBreaker) and 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AbstractCircuitBreaker.State). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class shows limited coupling and therefore is not a hub."
