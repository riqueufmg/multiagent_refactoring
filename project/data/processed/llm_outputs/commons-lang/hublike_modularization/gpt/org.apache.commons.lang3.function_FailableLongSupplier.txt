    "justification": "FailableLongSupplier has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the incoming class Failable lists many related types, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
