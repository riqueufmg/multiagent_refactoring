    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AnnotationUtils has outgoing dependencies to 5 other abstractions: org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringBuilder, org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.ClassUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringStyle. However, it has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies (and only a moderate number of outgoing links) means this class is not a hub."
