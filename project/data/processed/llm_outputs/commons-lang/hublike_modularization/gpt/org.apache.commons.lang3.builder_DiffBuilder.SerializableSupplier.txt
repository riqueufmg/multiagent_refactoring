    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.DiffBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
