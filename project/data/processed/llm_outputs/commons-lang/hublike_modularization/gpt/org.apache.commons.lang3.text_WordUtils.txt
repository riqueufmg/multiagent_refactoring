    "justification": "WordUtils has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils). Although StringUtils itself lists multiple dependencies, WordUtils does not have both incoming and outgoing connections to a large number of other abstractions when considered in isolation, so it is not a hub-like module."
