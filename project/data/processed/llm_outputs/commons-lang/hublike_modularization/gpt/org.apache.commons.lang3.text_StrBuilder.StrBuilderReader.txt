    "justification": "The analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []) and no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []), and the analyzed_package.dependencies list is empty. Because it has zero incoming and zero outgoing relationships, it cannot exhibit Hub-like Modularization which requires many incoming and/or outgoing dependencies."
