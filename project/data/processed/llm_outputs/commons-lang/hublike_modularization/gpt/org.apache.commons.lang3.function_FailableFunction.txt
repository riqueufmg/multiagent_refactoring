    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. FailableFunction has 0 outgoing dependencies and 4 incoming dependencies (ArrayUtils, Failable, FailableBiFunction, MethodInvokers). Because outgoing dependencies are empty, it does not meet the bidirectional 'hub' characteristic and therefore is not detected as hub-like."
