    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.AbstractFormatCache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AbstractFormatCache has a small number of connections: 3 outgoing references (TimeZones, LocaleUtils, and its own nested ArrayKey) and 1 incoming reference (FastDateFormat). One of the outgoing dependencies is an internal nested class (ArrayKey), so externally it interacts with only two other distinct abstractions (TimeZones and LocaleUtils) and a single incoming client. This does not constitute a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
