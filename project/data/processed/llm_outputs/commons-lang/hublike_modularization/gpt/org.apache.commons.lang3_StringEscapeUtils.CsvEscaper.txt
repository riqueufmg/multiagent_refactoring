    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.Strings and org.apache.commons.lang3.CharUtils). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; the provided data shows low coupling in both directions, so it does not qualify."
