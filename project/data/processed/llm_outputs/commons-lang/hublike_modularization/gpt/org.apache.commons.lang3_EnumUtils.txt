    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.EnumUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the class to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. EnumUtils has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemProperties) and 0 incoming dependencies. While SystemProperties itself depends on three classes, that does not increase EnumUtils' incoming/outgoing counts when analyzed in isolation. Therefore EnumUtils is not a hub-like module."
