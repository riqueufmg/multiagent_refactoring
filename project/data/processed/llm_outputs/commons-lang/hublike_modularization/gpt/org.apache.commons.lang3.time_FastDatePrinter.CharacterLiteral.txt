    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only a single incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions. Here the CharacterLiteral interacts directly with only one other class, so it is not a hub."
