    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentUtils) and only one incoming dependency entry (from org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentUtils). There is a single distinct connected abstraction (ConcurrentUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies to many other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
