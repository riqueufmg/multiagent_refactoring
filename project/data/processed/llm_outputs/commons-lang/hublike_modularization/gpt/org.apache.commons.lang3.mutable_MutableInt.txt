    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableInt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MutableInt has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; MutableInt does not meet these criteria. Although ArrayUtils depends on many classes (including MutableInt), that does not make MutableInt a hub in isolation."
