    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. In the provided data, incoming_dependencies is empty and outgoing_dependencies is empty, so the class has no recorded incoming or outgoing connections and therefore does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
