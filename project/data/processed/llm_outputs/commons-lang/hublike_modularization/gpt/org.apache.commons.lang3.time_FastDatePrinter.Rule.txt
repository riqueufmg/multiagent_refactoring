    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter). Although FastDatePrinter itself references many types, FastDatePrinter.Rule itself is connected to only a single other abstraction (incoming count = 1, outgoing count = 0), so it does not qualify as hub-like."
