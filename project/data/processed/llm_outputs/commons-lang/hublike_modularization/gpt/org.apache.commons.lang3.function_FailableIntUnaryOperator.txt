    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 0 outgoing dependencies (both incoming_dependencies and outgoing_dependencies arrays are empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; with no incoming or outgoing dependencies, this class does not meet that criterion."
