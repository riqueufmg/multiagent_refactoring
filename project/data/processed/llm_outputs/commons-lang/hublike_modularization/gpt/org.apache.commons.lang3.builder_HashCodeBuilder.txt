    "justification": "HashCodeBuilder has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionToStringBuilder, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.Reflection, org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class has no incoming dependencies and only three direct outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the smell criteria."
