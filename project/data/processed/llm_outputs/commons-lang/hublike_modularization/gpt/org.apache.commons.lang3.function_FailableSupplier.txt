    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although FailableSupplier has many incoming dependencies (referenced by multiple classes such as org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.MethodInvokers, org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch, and several org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent initializers like LazyInitializer, AtomicSafeInitializer, AbstractConcurrentInitializer, AtomicInitializer, BackgroundInitializer — total of 9 distinct incoming callers), it has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because FailableSupplier lacks outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
