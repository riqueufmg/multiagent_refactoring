    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. In the provided data TypeUtils.WildcardTypeImpl has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils). Although ArrayUtils itself lists 7 dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of TypeUtils.WildcardTypeImpl in the given data. Therefore this class does not meet the hub-like modularization criteria."
