    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies with numerous other abstractions; this class interacts with only a single other class, so the smell is not present."
