    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.compare.ComparableUtils.ComparableCheckBuilder",

    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies: []). It has a single incoming dependency from org.apache.commons.lang3.compare.ComparableUtils (incoming_dependencies contains only ComparableUtils -> org.apache.commons.lang3.compare.ComparableUtils.ComparableCheckBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
