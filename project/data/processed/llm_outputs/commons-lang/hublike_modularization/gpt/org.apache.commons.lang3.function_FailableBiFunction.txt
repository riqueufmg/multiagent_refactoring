    "justification": "FailableBiFunction has 3 incoming dependencies: org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.MethodInvokers, org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple.Pair, and 1 outgoing dependency: org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableFunction. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing connections; these counts (incoming=3, outgoing=1) are small, so FailableBiFunction is not a hub in isolation."
