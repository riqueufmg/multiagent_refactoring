    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions.FailablePredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires the abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency source (org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions). Although Functions lists many related types in its own dependencies, those are not incoming/outgoing edges between FailablePredicate and many distinct abstractions. Therefore FailablePredicate does not exhibit a hub-like coupling pattern."
