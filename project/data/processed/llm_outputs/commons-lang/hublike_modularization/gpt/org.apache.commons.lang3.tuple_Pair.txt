    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Pair has a small set of dependencies: 3 outgoing (org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple.ImmutablePair, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBiConsumer, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBiFunction) and 2 incoming (org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple.ImmutablePair, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.EqualsBuilder). The number of unique connected abstractions is small (ImmutablePair, FailableBiConsumer, FailableBiFunction, EqualsBuilder) and includes a reciprocal relation with ImmutablePair, but does not show dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Therefore it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell."
