    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []) and only 1 incoming dependency (incoming from org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions). Although org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions depends on many abstractions (including Functions.FailableBiFunction, Functions.FailableSupplier, Functions.FailableRunnable, Functions.FailablePredicate, function.FailableBooleanSupplier, Functions.FailableBiPredicate, Functions.FailableCallable, Functions.FailableBiConsumer, Functions.FailableConsumer, Functions.FailableFunction), the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization (incoming_count = 1, outgoing_count = 0)."
