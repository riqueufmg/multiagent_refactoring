    "justification": "SerializationUtils has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils and org.apache.commons.lang3.SerializationUtils.ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows neither a large number of incoming connections nor a large number of outgoing connections. (Note: ObjectUtils has several dependencies, but those are not incoming to SerializationUtils and do not make SerializationUtils a hub in isolation.)"
