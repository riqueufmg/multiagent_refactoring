    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: RecursiveToStringStyle has only two outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.ClassUtils and org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionToStringBuilder) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming_dependencies is empty and outgoing count is low (2), so it does not qualify as a hub."
