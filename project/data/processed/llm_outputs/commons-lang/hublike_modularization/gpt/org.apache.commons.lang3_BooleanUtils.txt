    "justification": "BooleanUtils has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils) and 3 incoming dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableBoolean, org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.InheritanceUtils). These counts are small and do not show a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships required to classify it as Hub-like Modularization. Note: ArrayUtils appears as both incoming and outgoing (circular), but overall connectivity remains limited."
