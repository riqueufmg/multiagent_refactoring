    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.RuntimeEnvironment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "RuntimeEnvironment has only two outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.CharUtils) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. The provided data shows low outgoing degree (2) and no incoming edges, so the hub-like smell is not present. Note: StringUtils itself has many dependencies, but those are outgoing from StringUtils, not incoming to RuntimeEnvironment."
