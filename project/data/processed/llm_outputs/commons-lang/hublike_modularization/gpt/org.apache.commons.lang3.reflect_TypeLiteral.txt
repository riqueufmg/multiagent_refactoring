    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeLiteral has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeUtils (the single outgoing dependency) itself depends on many classes (Validate, ArrayUtils, ClassUtils, ObjectUtils, AppendableJoiner, TypeUtils.WildcardTypeBuilder, Typed), those are not direct incoming/outgoing relationships of TypeLiteral. Therefore TypeLiteral is not a hub."
