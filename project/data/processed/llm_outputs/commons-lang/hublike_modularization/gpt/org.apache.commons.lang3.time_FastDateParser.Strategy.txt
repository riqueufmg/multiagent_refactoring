    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.Strategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency entry (from org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing connections with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing connection counts are low, so the smell is not present."
