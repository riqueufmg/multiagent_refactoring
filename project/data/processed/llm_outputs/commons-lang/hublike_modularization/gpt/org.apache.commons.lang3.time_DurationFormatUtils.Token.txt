    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationFormatUtils). Given the low counts (incoming=1, outgoing=0) it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
