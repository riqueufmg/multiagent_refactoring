    "justification": "LangCollectors has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils) and only 2 incoming dependencies shown (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils and org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.MethodUtils). The counts of incoming and outgoing relationships are small and do not constitute dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell."
