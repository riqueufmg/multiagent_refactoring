    "justification": "AppendableJoiner has a small set of relationships: 3 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBiConsumer, org.apache.commons.lang3.AppendableJoiner.Builder) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeUtils). These low incoming/outgoing counts indicate it is not connected to a large number of other abstractions and therefore does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
