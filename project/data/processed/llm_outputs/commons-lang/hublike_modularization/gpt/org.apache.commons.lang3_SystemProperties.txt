    "justification": "SystemProperties has 5 incoming dependencies (JavaVersion, SystemUtils, EnumUtils, ArchUtils, time.TimeZones) but only 3 outgoing dependencies (StringUtils, Suppliers, ClassUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have large numbers of both incoming and outgoing links; here the outgoing fan-out is small, so it does not qualify as a hub."
