    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.EventCountCircuitBreaker). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows minimal interaction, so it is not a hub."
