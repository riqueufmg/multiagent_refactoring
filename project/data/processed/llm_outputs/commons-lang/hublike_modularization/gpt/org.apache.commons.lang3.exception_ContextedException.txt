    "justification": "ContextedException has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ExceptionContext and org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.DefaultExceptionContext) and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections; here the incoming count is zero and the outgoing count is small, so the class does not exhibit the hub-like smell."
