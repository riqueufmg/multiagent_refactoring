    "justification": "FailableCallable has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has only one incoming dependency entry (from org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable). Although that incoming class lists many dependencies (19 types), FailableCallable itself receives a single incoming reference and has no outgoing references. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition."
