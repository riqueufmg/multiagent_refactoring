    "justification": "CsvUnescaper has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.Strings, org.apache.commons.lang3.CharUtils) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number in either direction."
