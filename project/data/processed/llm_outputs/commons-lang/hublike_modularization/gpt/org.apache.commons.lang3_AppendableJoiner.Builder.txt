    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBiConsumer) and 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.AppendableJoiner). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; here both counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
