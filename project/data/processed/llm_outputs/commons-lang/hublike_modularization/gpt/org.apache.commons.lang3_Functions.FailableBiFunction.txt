    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions.FailableBiFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has no outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only one incoming dependency entry (org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions). Although that incoming class (Functions) references many failable types, the analyzed class itself is connected to only one other abstraction, so it does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies required for Hub-like Modularization."
