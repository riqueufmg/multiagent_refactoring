    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only one incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.ThreadUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks outgoing links and does not have many incoming links, so it is not a hub."
