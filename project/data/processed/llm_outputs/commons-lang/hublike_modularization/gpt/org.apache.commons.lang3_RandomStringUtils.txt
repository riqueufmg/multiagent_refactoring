    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []), so it is not a hub. Outgoing dependencies are limited to three direct targets: org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.CachedRandomBits, and org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils. Although org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils itself lists many dependencies, RandomStringUtils does not have a large number of direct incoming and outgoing connections as required by the Hub-like Modularization smell."
