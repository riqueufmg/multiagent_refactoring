    "justification": "CharSequenceUtils has a small number of dependencies: outgoing -> [org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils] (2); incoming -> [org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.Strings] (2). There are 3 unique other abstractions interacting with this class. Because both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are low and the total set of connected abstractions is small, this does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
