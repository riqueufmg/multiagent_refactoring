    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies (dependencies: []) and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.LocaleUtils). With incoming count = 1 and outgoing count = 0, it is not connected to a large number of other abstractions, so the smell is not detected."
