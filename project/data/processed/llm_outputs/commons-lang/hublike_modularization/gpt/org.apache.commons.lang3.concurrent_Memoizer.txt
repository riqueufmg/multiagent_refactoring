    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.Memoizer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Memoizer has 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.Computable) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and outgoing). Given the single outgoing and no incoming dependencies, the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
