    "justification": "ObjectUtils has a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies in the provided data. Incoming: 9 distinct classes reference ObjectUtils (SerializationUtils, ArrayUtils, AnnotationUtils, StringUtils, HashCodeBuilder, ToStringStyle, CompareToBuilder, DiffBuilder, TypeUtils). Outgoing: ObjectUtils depends on 5 distinct classes (ObjectUtils.Null, StringUtils, StrBuilder, Suppliers, DurationUtils). There is also a bidirectional relationship with StringUtils (appears in both incoming and outgoing lists). The presence of many incoming dependents together with multiple outgoing dependencies identifies ObjectUtils as a hub-like abstraction."
