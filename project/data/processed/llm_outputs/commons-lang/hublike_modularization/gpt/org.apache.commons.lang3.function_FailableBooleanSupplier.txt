    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBooleanSupplier",

    "justification": "FailableBooleanSupplier has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 2 incoming dependents (org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions and org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the outgoing count is zero, so the hub-like smell is not present. Note: while the incoming classes reference many related failable types, the analyzed class itself does not depend on many others."
