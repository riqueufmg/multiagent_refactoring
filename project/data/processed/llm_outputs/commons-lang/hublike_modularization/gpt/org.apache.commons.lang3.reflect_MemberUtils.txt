    "justification": "MemberUtils is not a hub: it has a small set of incoming and outgoing relationships. Incoming dependents (3): MethodUtils, ConstructorUtils, FieldUtils. Outgoing dependencies (3): org.apache.commons.lang3.ClassUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.AccessibleObjects, org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.MemberUtils.Executable. Hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows only a few connections concentrated within the package, so the smell is not detected."
