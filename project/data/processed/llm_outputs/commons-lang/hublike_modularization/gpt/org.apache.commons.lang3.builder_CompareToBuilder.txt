    "justification": "CompareToBuilder has 3 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionToStringBuilder, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.Reflection, org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming dependency count is zero and the outgoing count is small, so the smell is not present."
