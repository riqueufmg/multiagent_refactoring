    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. In this case the analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies: org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentException, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableConsumer, and org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableSupplier. Because there are zero incoming dependencies and only a small number of outgoing dependencies, this does not qualify as a hub-like module."
