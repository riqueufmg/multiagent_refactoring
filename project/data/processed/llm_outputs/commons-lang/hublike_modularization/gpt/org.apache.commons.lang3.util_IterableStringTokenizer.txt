    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.util.IterableStringTokenizer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IterableStringTokenizer has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The provided outgoing_dependencies show ArrayUtils depends on several classes, but IterableStringTokenizer itself does not have many outgoing links nor any incoming links, so the hub smell is not present."
