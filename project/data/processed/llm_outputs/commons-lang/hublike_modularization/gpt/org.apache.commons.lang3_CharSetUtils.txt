    "justification": "CharSetUtils has only two outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.CharSet) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections to other abstractions; the provided data shows a small number of outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, so this is not a hub."
