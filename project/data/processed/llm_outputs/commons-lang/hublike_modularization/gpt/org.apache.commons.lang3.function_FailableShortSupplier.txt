    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableShortSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []), and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here FailableShortSupplier lacks outgoing links and has a single incoming link, so it does not meet the hub criteria."
