    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableToDoubleBiFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "incoming_dependencies: 0; outgoing_dependencies: 0. The class has no incoming or outgoing dependencies in the provided data, so it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions and therefore does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization (analysis performed in isolation)."
