    "justification": "Not detected. The analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies (no declared dependencies) and only 1 incoming dependency (referenced by org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here both incoming (1) and outgoing (0) counts are low, so the smell is not present."
