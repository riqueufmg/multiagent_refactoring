    "justification": "LongRange is not hub-like: it has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationUtils). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; LongRange is connected only to DurationUtils, so it does not meet the criteria."
