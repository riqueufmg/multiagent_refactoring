    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableBoolean",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MutableBoolean has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.BooleanUtils) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows no large number of incoming or outgoing links (outgoing=1, incoming=0), so the smell is not present."
