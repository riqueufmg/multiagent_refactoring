    "justification": "DurationFormatUtils has a small number of outgoing dependencies (4: org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.Strings, org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationFormatUtils.Token) and a single incoming dependency (1: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch). The incoming/outgoing degree is low and does not show dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
