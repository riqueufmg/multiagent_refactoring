    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.StringLiteral",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is not a hub: it has 0 outgoing dependencies (no listed outgoing_dependencies) and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter, which references FastDatePrinter.StringLiteral). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here there is a single incoming link and no outgoing links, so the smell is not present."
