    "justification": "StrBuilder has a high number of both outgoing and incoming ties in the provided data: outgoing dependencies = 6 (org.apache.commons.lang3.Strings, org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrMatcher, org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.CharUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrTokenizer); incoming dependencies = 3 (org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrSubstitutor, org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrTokenizer). There are 8 distinct collaborating abstractions in total, including a mutual dependency with StrTokenizer (appears in both incoming and outgoing lists). Several of its neighbors (for example org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils and org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils) themselves show many dependencies in the provided data, indicating StrBuilder sits at a central junction of interactions. These facts match the Hub-like Modularization smell (many incoming and outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions)."
