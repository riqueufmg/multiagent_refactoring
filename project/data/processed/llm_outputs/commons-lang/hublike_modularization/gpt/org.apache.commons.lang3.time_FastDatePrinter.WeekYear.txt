    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.WeekYear",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here the analyzed class interacts only with a single other class, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
