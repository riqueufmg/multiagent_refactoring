    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.DiffResult, and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and/or outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here outgoing count = 1 (org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.DiffResult) and incoming count = 0, so it is not a hub."
