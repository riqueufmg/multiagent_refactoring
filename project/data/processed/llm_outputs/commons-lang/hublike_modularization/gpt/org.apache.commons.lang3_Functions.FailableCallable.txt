    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; these counts are low. While org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions references many related classes, that makes Functions a hub, not org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions.FailableCallable."
