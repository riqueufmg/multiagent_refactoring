    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 0 (outgoing_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class has none, so the smell is not detected."
