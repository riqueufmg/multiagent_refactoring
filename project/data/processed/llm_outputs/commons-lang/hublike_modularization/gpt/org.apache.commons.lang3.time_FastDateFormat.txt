    "justification": "FastDateFormat has only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter, org.apache.commons.lang3.time.AbstractFormatCache, org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateFormatUtils) in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides. Although the outgoing classes themselves list many internal dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of FastDateFormat in the provided input; therefore, based on the given data, FastDateFormat is not a hub."
