    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 1 (org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter). Outgoing dependencies: 0. Hub-like Modularization requires the class to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has only a single incoming dependency and no outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub. Note: the incoming class (FastDatePrinter) references many types, but that does not make TwentyFourHourField itself have many incoming/outgoing relations."
