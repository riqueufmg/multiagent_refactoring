    "justification": "BackgroundInitializer has 5 outgoing dependencies: org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentException, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableSupplier, org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.BackgroundInitializer.Builder, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableConsumer, and only 1 incoming dependency: org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.MultiBackgroundInitializer. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections to many other abstractions. In this data the incoming count is very low (1) and the outgoing set is modest and largely composed of related utility/functional types, so it does not qualify as a hub."
