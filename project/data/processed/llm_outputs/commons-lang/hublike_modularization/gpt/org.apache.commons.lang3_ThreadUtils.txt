    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. In this analysis ThreadUtils has 0 incoming dependencies and 4 outgoing dependencies: org.apache.commons.lang3.ThreadUtils.ThreadPredicate, org.apache.commons.lang3.ThreadUtils.ThreadGroupPredicate, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Predicates, org.apache.commons.lang3.ThreadUtils.AlwaysTruePredicate. Because there are no incoming dependencies and the number of outgoing dependencies is small, the hub-like modularization smell is not detected."
