    "justification": "The analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. While FastDatePrinter (the single incoming class) lists many dependencies, FastDatePrinter.TimeZoneNumberRule itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies (incoming count = 1, outgoing count = 0), so it is not a hub."
