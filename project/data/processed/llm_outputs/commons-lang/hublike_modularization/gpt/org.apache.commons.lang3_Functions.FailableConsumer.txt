    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has a single incoming dependency (only org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions references it). Although that Functions class references many related Failable* types, org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions.FailableConsumer itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing ties, so it is not a hub."
