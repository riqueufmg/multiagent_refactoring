    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 0 (no outgoing dependencies). Incoming dependencies: 1 (only org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable). Although the incoming class Failable references many related types (e.g., FailableRunnable, FailableDoubleConsumer, FailableDoubleSupplier, FailableSupplier, FailableLongConsumer, FailableFunction, FailableCallable, FailableIntConsumer, FailableBiFunction, FailableDoubleBinaryOperator, FailableBiPredicate, FailableBooleanSupplier, FailableShortSupplier, FailablePredicate, FailableBiConsumer, FailableIntSupplier, FailableLongSupplier, FailableConsumer), the analyzed class itself has a single incoming link and no outgoing links. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (which requires the abstraction itself to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
