    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.CharSequenceTranslator) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; these counts do not meet that criterion, so the smell is not detected."
