    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although StringUtils (the single outgoing target) itself has many dependencies, those are transitive and the analysis of this class in isolation shows it is not a hub."
