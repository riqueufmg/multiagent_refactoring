    "justification": "StringEscapeUtils has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.Strings, org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.CharSequenceTranslator, org.apache.commons.lang3.CharUtils) and has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming is zero and outgoing is small, so the smell is not present."
