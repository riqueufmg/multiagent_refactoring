    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 0 (no outgoing dependencies). Incoming dependencies: 3 classes reference this class (org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable, org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch, org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationUtils). Although org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable lists many related Failable* types (including FailableRunnable), the target class itself has no outgoing links and only a small number of incoming references. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
