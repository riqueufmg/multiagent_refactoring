    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Failable has many outgoing dependencies (18 outgoing references: FailableRunnable, FailableDoubleConsumer, FailableDoubleSupplier, FailableSupplier, FailableLongConsumer, FailableFunction, FailableCallable, FailableIntConsumer, FailableBiFunction, FailableDoubleBinaryOperator, FailableBiPredicate, FailableBooleanSupplier, FailableShortSupplier, FailablePredicate, FailableBiConsumer, FailableIntSupplier, FailableLongSupplier, FailableConsumer) but zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Because it lacks incoming dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub."
