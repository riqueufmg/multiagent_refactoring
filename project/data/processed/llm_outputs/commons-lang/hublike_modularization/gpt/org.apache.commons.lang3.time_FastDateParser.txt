    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FastDateParser has 6 outgoing dependencies (FastDateParser.StrategyAndWidth, LocaleUtils, FastDateParser.ISO8601TimeZoneStrategy, TimeZones, FastDateParser.StrategyParser, FastDateParser.Strategy) and 2 incoming dependencies (FastDateFormat, DateUtils). While it interacts with several related strategy/utility classes, the incoming dependency count is low (2) and the overall number of distinct connected abstractions (8) is not sufficiently large in both directions to qualify as hub-like modularization. Therefore it does not meet the definition of a hub (many incoming and many outgoing)."
