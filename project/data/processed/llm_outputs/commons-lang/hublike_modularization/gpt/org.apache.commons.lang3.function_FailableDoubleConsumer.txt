    "justification": "FailableDoubleConsumer has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies: []) and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although the incoming class org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable references many classes (18 listed), the analyzed class itself is not highly connected — it has no outgoing edges and a single incoming edge — so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
