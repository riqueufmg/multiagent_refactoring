    "justification": "Not detected. The analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing connections). Here there is a single incoming edge and no outgoing edges, so the class is not acting as a hub."
