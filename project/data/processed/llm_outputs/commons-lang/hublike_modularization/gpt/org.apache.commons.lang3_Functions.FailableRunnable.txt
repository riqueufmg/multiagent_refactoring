    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 0. Incoming dependencies: 1 (org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions -> org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions.FailableRunnable). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class has neither many incoming nor outgoing links, so the smell is not present."
