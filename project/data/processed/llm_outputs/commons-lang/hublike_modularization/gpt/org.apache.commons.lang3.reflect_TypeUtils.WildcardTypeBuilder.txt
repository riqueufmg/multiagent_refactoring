    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeUtils.WildcardTypeBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here both counts are low. Although TypeUtils depends on many classes, WildcardTypeBuilder itself does not have many incoming or outgoing links."
