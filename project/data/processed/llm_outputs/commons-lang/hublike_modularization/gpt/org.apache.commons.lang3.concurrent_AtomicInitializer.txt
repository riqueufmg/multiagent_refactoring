This class has 0 incoming dependencies and 4 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AtomicInitializer.Builder, org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentException, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableSupplier, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableConsumer). Because there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing set is not large enough, the hub-like smell is not detected."
