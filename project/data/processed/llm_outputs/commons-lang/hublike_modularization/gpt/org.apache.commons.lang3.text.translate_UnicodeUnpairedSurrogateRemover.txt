    "justification": "Both incoming_dependencies and outgoing_dependencies are empty (counts: incoming=0, outgoing=0). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class has no incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit the smell."
