    "justification": "ConcurrentUtils has a small set of outgoing dependencies (4): org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentException, org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ExceptionUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentInitializer, org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentRuntimeException; and a small set of incoming dependencies (3): org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentException, org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentRuntimeException, org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.BackgroundInitializer. The number of distinct incoming and outgoing relationships is low and mostly confined to the same package, so it does not exhibit the high-degree incoming and outgoing coupling characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
