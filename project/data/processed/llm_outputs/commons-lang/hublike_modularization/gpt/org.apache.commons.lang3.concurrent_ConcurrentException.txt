    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ConcurrentException has many incoming dependencies (8 classes depend on it: LazyInitializer, AtomicSafeInitializer, AbstractConcurrentInitializer, ConstantInitializer, AtomicInitializer, ConcurrentUtils, BackgroundInitializer, MultiBackgroundInitializer) but only a single outgoing dependency (1 class: ConcurrentUtils). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing dependency count is minimal, so the class is not acting as a hub per the provided data."
