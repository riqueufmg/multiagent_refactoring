    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableConsumer, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableSupplier) but has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires having both many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming_dependencies = 0, so the smell is not detected."
