    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.DiffBuilder). Although DiffBuilder's dependency list includes multiple classes (org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.DiffBuilder.SerializableSupplier, org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.DiffResult, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringStyle, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.Builder), the Builder class itself does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections, so it is not a hub."
