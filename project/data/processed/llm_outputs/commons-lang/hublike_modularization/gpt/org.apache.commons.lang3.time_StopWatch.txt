StopWatch has outgoing dependencies to 6 abstractions (org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableRunnable, org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationFormatUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableSupplier, org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch.State, org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch.SplitState) and 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies (and only a moderate number of outgoing ones), it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
