    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.time.TimeZones). The referenced TimeZones class itself depends on org.apache.commons.lang3.JavaVersion and org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemProperties, but those are not direct incoming dependencies of the analyzed class. With incoming=0 and outgoing=1, it does not meet the 'hub-like' criteria."
