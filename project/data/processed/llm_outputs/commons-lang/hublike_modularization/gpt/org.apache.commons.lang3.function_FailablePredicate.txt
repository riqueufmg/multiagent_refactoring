    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FailablePredicate has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency source (org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable). Although the incoming class Failable references many Failable* types (including FailablePredicate), the analyzed class itself does not have both numerous incoming and outgoing connections required for Hub-like Modularization. Therefore the smell is not detected for FailablePredicate."
