    "justification": "CalendarUtils has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions. Here the incoming set is a single class and the outgoing set is empty, so the hub-like smell is not present."
