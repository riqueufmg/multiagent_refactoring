    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBiPredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FailableBiPredicate has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable). Although the incoming class Failable depends on 18 abstractions (including FailableBiPredicate), the analyzed class itself does not have both many incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization. Therefore the smell is not detected for FailableBiPredicate."
