    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks.LockingVisitors). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing ties with a large number of other abstractions; here the interaction count is low, so the smell is not present."
