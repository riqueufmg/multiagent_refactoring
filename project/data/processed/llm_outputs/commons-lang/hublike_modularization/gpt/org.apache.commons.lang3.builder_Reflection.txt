    "justification": "The class has 3 incoming dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.HashCodeBuilder, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.EqualsBuilder, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.CompareToBuilder) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (both incoming and outgoing). With only three incoming links and no outgoing links, this class does not meet the criterion for a hub."
