    "justification": "MultiBackgroundInitializer has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.MultiBackgroundInitializer.MultiBackgroundInitializerResults, org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.BackgroundInitializer, org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentException). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; the absence of incoming links and a small number of outgoing links indicate this class is not a hub."
