    "justification": "FailableBiPredicate has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has a single incoming dependency: org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions (incoming_dependencies contains only that class). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships with many other abstractions; here FailableBiPredicate is referenced by one class and does not depend on other abstractions, so it is not a hub."
