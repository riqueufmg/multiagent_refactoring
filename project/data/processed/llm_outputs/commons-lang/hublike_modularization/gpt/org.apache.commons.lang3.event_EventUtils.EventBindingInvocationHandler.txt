    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.event.EventUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class shows minimal incoming/outgoing coupling, so the smell is not present."
