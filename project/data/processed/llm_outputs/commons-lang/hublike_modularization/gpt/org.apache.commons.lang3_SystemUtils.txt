    "justification": "SystemUtils has 4 outgoing dependencies: org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.Strings, org.apache.commons.lang3.JavaVersion, org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemProperties, and a single incoming dependency from org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.FieldUtils. The total number of distinct direct incoming+outgoing connections is 5, which is small. While the outgoing target classes themselves have further dependencies, the provided data shows SystemUtils does not itself exhibit a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships required to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
