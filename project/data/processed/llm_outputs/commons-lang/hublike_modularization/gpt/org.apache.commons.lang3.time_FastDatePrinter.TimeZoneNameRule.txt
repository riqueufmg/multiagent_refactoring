    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only 1 incoming dependency entry (from org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the class is referenced by a single class and does not reference others, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
