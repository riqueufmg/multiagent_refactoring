    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.NumericEntityUnescaper.OPTION and org.apache.commons.lang3.CharUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class's dependency counts are low, so it is not a hub."
