    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. For org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.UncheckedFutureImpl both outgoing_dependencies and incoming_dependencies are empty (0 connections), so it does not exhibit hub-like coupling."
