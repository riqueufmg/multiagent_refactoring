    "justification": "FormattableUtils has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections. Although StringUtils (the single outgoing dependency) itself depends on many classes, FormattableUtils itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
