    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks.LockingVisitors",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LockingVisitors has outgoing dependencies to three inner visitor classes (LockingVisitors.ReadWriteLockVisitor, LockingVisitors.StampedLockVisitor, LockingVisitors.ReentrantLockVisitor) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the dependency count is low (3 outgoing, 0 incoming) and limited to its own inner visitors, so the hub smell is not present."
