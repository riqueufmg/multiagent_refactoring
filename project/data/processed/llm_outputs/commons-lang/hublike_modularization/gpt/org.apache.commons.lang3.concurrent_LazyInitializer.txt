Outgoing dependencies: 4 (org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.LazyInitializer.Builder, org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentException, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableSupplier, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableConsumer). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only four outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the smell criteria."
