    "justification": "FastDatePrinter has many outgoing dependencies (20 distinct targets including nested rule/field classes such as FastDatePrinter.Iso8601_Rule, FastDatePrinter.TextField, FastDatePrinter.TimeZoneDisplayKey, FastDatePrinter.TwoDigitYearField, FastDatePrinter.NumberRule, FastDatePrinter.TimeZoneNameRule, FastDatePrinter.TwentyFourHourField, FastDatePrinter.TimeZoneNumberRule, and utility classes like org.apache.commons.lang3.LocaleUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.CharUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.time.CalendarUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ExceptionUtils), but only a single incoming dependency is present (org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateFormat). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here outgoing is large but incoming is minimal, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
