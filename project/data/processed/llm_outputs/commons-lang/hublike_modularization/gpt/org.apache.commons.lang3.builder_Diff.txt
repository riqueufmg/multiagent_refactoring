    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeUtils) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; Diff does not meet that condition. (Note: TypeUtils itself lists many dependencies, but the analyzed class in isolation does not.)"
