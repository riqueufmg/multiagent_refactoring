    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable). Although the incoming class (Failable) references many related classes, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relations. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
