    "justification": "Not detected: the analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks.LockingVisitors). Although that incoming class lists three visitor dependencies (ReadWriteLockVisitor, StampedLockVisitor, ReentrantLockVisitor), the StampedLockVisitor itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming and outgoing links required for Hub-like Modularization."
