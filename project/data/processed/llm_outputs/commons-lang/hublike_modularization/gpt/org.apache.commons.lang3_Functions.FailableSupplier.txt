    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions.FailableSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions). Although that incoming class (org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions) lists 10 dependencies (multiple Failable* types), those are dependencies of the Functions class, not direct incoming/outgoing relationships for Functions.FailableSupplier. Therefore Functions.FailableSupplier does not have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions and is not hub-like."
