    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeUtils). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; these metrics (incoming=1, outgoing=0) do not meet that criterion. The only cited incoming dependency is org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeUtils (which itself depends on several classes), but Typed itself is not connected to a large number of other abstractions."
