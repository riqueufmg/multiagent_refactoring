    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.EventCountCircuitBreaker). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions; this class does not exhibit that pattern."
