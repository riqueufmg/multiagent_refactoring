    "justification": "The package contains only 9 classes with 947 total lines of code, with the main outer class LockingVisitors having 440 lines. This is within reasonable bounds for a focused concurrency utility package, and there is no evidence of excessive responsibility aggregation or disproportionate size relative to typical utility packages."
