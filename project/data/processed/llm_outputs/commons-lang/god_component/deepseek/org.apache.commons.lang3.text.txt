    "justification": "The package has 10 top-level classes and 5402 LOC, which is moderate for a utility library package. The package is cohesive in functionality and has low coupling (Ce=2, Ca=1). While some individual classes are large (e.g., StrBuilder with 2304 LOC), the package as a whole is not excessively large in terms of LOC or number of classes."
