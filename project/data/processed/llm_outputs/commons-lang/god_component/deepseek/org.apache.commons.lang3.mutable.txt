    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package has 9 classes and 1884 LOC, which is moderate. Each class is focused and small (most under 300 LOC). The package is cohesive, providing mutable wrappers for primitive types, and exhibits low coupling (Ce=1, Ca=3). This does not indicate excessive size for a utility package in a library."
