Multiple classes like EventCountCircuitBreaker (316 LOC), TimedSemaphore (309 LOC), and BackgroundInitializer (235 LOC) are individually substantial. The package handles diverse responsibilities including circuit breakers, initializers, futures, semaphores, and thread factories, indicating lack of single responsibility."
