    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.event",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes with a total of 398 lines of code. The largest class, EventListenerSupport, has 219 lines of code and 15 methods, which is not excessively large in the context of this package. The distribution of functionality appears reasonable, and no single class or the package as a whole demonstrates excessive size or complexity that would indicate a God Component."
