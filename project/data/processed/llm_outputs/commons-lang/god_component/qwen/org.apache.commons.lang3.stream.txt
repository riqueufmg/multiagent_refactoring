    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.stream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with a total of 734 lines of code. The largest class, Streams, has 384 lines of code and 21 methods, which is significant but not excessively large in the context of a utility stream processing package. The distribution of functionality across multiple cohesive classes (e.g., LangCollectors, IntStreams, Streams) suggests a reasonable separation of concerns rather than a single God Component."
