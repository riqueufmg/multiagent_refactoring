    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package 'org.apache.commons.lang3' contains 73 classes and has a total of 26,295 lines of code, which is excessively large. Several individual classes within the package also exhibit high complexity and size, such as 'ArrayUtils' with 5,740 LOC and 377 methods, 'StringUtils' with 4,411 LOC and 244 methods, and 'SystemProperties' with 2,807 LOC and 205 methods. The high number of classes and substantial LOC at both the package and class levels indicate a God Component smell."
