    "package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 13 classes with a total of 746 lines of code. While the number of classes is moderately high, the LOC per class averages around 57, which is not excessively large. The classes appear to have well-defined responsibilities related to text translation and escaping, with no single class dominating the codebase in terms of size or complexity. The overall structure suggests a cohesive set of utilities rather than a monolithic component."
