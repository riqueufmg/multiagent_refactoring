    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes with a total of 1061 lines of code. While the class ExceptionUtils is notably large with 575 lines of code and 42 methods, the overall package distribution appears reasonable for an exception handling utility module. There is no excessive concentration of responsibilities in a single class that would indicate a God Component smell."
