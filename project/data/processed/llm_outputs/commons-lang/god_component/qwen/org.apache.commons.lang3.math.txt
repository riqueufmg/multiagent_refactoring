    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.math",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes but has a total of 2111 lines of code, with NumberUtils alone contributing 1271 LOC and 68 methods, and Fraction adding another 660 LOC with 34 methods. This concentration of functionality and size in a few classes indicates an excessive implementation within the package, suggesting it acts as a God Component by handling too much responsibility."
