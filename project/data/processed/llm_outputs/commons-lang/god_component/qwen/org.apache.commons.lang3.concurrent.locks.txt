    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes with a total of 947 lines of code, which is not excessively large for a package. The largest class, LockingVisitors, has 440 lines of code and 6 methods, which is also not excessively large. The package has low afferent (0) and efferent (2) coupling, indicating it is not overly dependent on or depended upon by other packages. There is no evidence of excessive complexity or centralization of functionality that would indicate a God Component."
