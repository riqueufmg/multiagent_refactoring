    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 29 classes with a total of 6366 lines of code. While the package has a considerable number of classes and lines of code, the classes appear to be well-organized and focused on specific responsibilities related to building and manipulating object representations (e.g., HashCodeBuilder, EqualsBuilder, ToStringBuilder). The largest classes, such as ToStringStyle (1694 LOC) and EqualsBuilder (720 LOC), are individually large but serve distinct purposes and are not excessively entangled. There is no single class or component that dominates the package by taking on too many responsibilities or being disproportionately large compared to others."
