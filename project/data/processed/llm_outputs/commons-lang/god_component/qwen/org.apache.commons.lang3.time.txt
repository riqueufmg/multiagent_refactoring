    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 51 classes with a total of 6908 lines of code. While the package is substantial, the classes are well-organized into cohesive units such as StopWatch, FastDateFormat, DateUtils, and FastDateParser, each encapsulating distinct time-related functionalities. The distribution of responsibilities across multiple classes indicates a modular design rather than a single God Component."
