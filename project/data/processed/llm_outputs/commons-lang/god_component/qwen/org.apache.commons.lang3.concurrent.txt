    "justification": "The package contains 42 classes with a total of 3203 lines of code. While the package has a substantial size, the classes are well-organized into cohesive components dealing with concurrent utilities (e.g., initializers, circuit breakers, thread factories). No single class dominates the codebase in terms of size or responsibility, and the functionality is appropriately distributed across multiple specialized classes."
