    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes with a total of 1884 lines of code. While the LOC count is moderately high, the classes are well-organized and each serves a distinct purpose (representing different mutable types). The average LOC per class is around 209, which is not excessively large. There's no single class dominating the codebase, and the responsibilities are appropriately distributed among the classes."
