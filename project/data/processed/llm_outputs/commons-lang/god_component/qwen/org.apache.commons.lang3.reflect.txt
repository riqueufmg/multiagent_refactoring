    "justification": "The package contains a single class, TypeUtils, with 1363 lines of code and 59 methods, making it excessively large. The package as a whole has 3368 lines of code and 14 classes, with TypeUtils dominating the codebase. The high WMC (236) and number of dependencies (7) further indicate excessive complexity and responsibility."
