    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a total of 463 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, FluentBitSet, has 396 lines of code and 44 methods, which while substantial, does not indicate a god component given the context of utility classes that typically encapsulate related functionality. The class distribution and LOC per class do not suggest an unreasonable concentration of responsibilities."
