    "justification": "The package contains 61 classes with a total of 2551 lines of code. While the number of classes is relatively high, the average LOC per class is around 41, which is not excessively large. The largest class, 'Failable', has 467 LOC and 37 methods, which is substantial but not disproportionately dominant compared to the rest of the classes. There is no single class or component that stands out as being excessively large in terms of responsibility or complexity within the package."
