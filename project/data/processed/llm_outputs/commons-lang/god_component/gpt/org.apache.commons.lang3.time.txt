    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a very large amount of code and many classes concentrated in a few huge components: num_classes=51 and loc=6908 at package level. Several classes are extremely large and complex (examples: FastDatePrinter loc=1132 wmc=102, DateUtils loc=1095 wmc=128, FastDateParser loc=764 wmc=77, DurationFormatUtils loc=561 wmc=85, StopWatch loc=549 wmc=56, FastDateFormat loc=422 wmc=44). Many of these classes include numerous nested/inner types and high method counts (e.g. DateUtils nom=67, FastDatePrinter has many inner Rule types), indicating a concentration of responsibilities. By contextual judgment (high total LOC, high number of classes and multiple very large/complex classes within the same package) this package exhibits the God Component smell."
