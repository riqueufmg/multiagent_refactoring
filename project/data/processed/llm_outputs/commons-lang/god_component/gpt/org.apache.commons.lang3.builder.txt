    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is excessively large: 29 classes and 6,366 LOC overall with a heavy concentration of code in a few very large classes. Notable large/complex classes include ToStringStyle (LOC 1694, NOM 113, WMC 191), EqualsBuilder (LOC 720, NOM 42, WMC 126), ToStringBuilder (LOC 646, NOM 63, WMC 68), CompareToBuilder (LOC 620, NOM 31, WMC 115), HashCodeBuilder (LOC 507, WMC 72) and ReflectionToStringBuilder (LOC 440, WMC 52), plus DiffBuilder (LOC 421). Several classes alone account for a large fraction of the package LOC and high method counts/complexity, indicating the component centralizes too much responsibility and size, which supports the God Component detection."
