    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package has 14 classes and 3,368 LOC but three classes dominate size: TypeUtils (LOC 1,363, WMC 236, NOM 59), MethodUtils (LOC 674, WMC 76, NOM 34) and FieldUtils (LOC 584, WMC 48, NOM 36). Those three (3 of 14 classes) account for ~77.8% of the package LOC (2,621/3,368), showing excessive concentration of code and responsibilities in a few components. TypeUtils itself contains many public methods and nested types (multiple inner classes), further indicating a single oversized component. These metrics support detection of a God Component in this package."
