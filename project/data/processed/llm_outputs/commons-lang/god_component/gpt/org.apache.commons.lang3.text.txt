    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package has a large overall size (5402 LOC across 20 classes) with extreme concentration of code in a few classes: StrBuilder (2304 LOC, 150 methods, WMC 341), StrTokenizer (731 LOC, 64 methods, WMC 100) and StrSubstitutor (782 LOC, 55 methods, WMC 98). These very large classes (high LOC, many methods and high complexity) indicate a single component carrying excessive responsibilities. The package's low external coupling (Ce=2, Ca=1) and the skewed LOC distribution support the judgment that this package contains a God Component. "
