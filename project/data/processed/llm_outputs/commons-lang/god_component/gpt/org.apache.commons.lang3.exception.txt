    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes and 1,061 LOC, with a strong concentration of size and complexity in a single class. ExceptionUtils alone is 575 LOC (≈54% of the package LOC) with 42 methods (nom) and WMC 82, indicating high internal complexity and responsibility. Other classes are moderate (ContextedException and ContextedRuntimeException 126 LOC each, DefaultExceptionContext 99 LOC), but no other class approaches ExceptionUtils' size. This skew—one very large, complex class within a relatively small package—supports identifying the package as a God Component (excessive size concentrated in a component)."
