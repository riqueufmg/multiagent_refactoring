    "justification": "The package is excessively large: 73 classes and 26,295 LOC. It contains multiple very large, complex classes that dominate the package (ArrayUtils: 5,740 LOC, nom 377, wmc 870; StringUtils: 4,411 LOC, nom 244, wmc 713; SystemProperties: 2,807 LOC, nom 205, wmc 206; Conversion: 1,110 LOC, wmc 245; ClassUtils: 1,088 LOC, nom 66, wmc 157). Several of these large classes also show signs of low cohesion/complexity (e.g., Validate lcom 0.9259, ObjectUtils lcom 0.7308, Conversion lcom 0.6744). The package has many methods and high complexity concentrated in a few classes, plus broad dependencies to many subpackages, indicating a monolithic component that fits the God Component smell."
