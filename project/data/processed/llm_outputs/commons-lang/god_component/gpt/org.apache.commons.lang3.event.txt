    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package has 4 classes and 398 LOC, but one class (EventListenerSupport) accounts for 219 LOC (~55% of the package), has 15 methods (highest in the package) and WMC 17, while the other top-level classes are much smaller (EventUtils 84 LOC; nested handlers 43 and 52 LOC). This strong concentration of size and complexity in a single class indicates the package's responsibilities are overly centralized, consistent with a God Component smell."
