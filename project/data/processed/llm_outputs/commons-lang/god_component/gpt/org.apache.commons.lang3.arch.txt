    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.arch",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes (num_classes=3) and 219 LOC overall, with the largest class (Processor) at 153 LOC and 11 methods (nom=11, wmc=11). Coupling is very low (Ce=0, Ca=1, fanin/fanout=0) and cohesion metrics are acceptable (lcom=0). Given the small number of classes, moderate total LOC, lack of high complexity or heavy coupling, this does not meet the contextual threshold for a God Component."
