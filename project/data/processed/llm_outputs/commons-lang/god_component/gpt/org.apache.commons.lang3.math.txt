    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package has a high total size (loc=2111) concentrated in only 3 classes, indicating excessive volume in a small component. Two classes are very large: NumberUtils (loc=1271, nom=68, nopm=62, wmc=196) and Fraction (loc=660, nom=34, wmc=97), with a third smaller class IEEE754rUtils (loc=180). The large LOC, high number of methods and high complexity metrics (wmc) in these classes show the package centralizes a lot of functionality, supporting the detection of a God Component."
