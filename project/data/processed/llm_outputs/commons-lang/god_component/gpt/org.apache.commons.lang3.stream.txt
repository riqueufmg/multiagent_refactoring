    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.stream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package has 7 classes and 734 LOC, which is not an excessive number of classes and a moderate total size. However, size and complexity are concentrated in a single class: Streams has 384 LOC (≈52% of the package), 21 methods and WMC 21, while other classes are much smaller (LangCollectors 95 LOC, Streams.FailableStream 121 LOC, nested small collectors/spliterators). This distribution indicates a large/god-like class within the package (Streams) rather than the package itself being a God Component. Therefore the package does not qualify as a God Component based on the provided data."
