    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes and 1,884 LOC, which is moderate rather than excessively large. Individual classes are fairly uniform (several numeric Mutable* classes around 260–280 LOC with nom ~30 and wmc ~31–32) and represent narrow, repeated responsibilities (primitive/object mutable wrappers). Cohesion indicators (LCOM values ~0.06–0.29) are low (high cohesion), fanin/fanout are 0 for most classes, and package coupling is low (Ce=1, Ca=3). There is no evidence of a single class or the package aggregating many unrelated responsibilities; the size stems from repeated, focused wrapper classes. Therefore this package does not qualify as a God Component."
