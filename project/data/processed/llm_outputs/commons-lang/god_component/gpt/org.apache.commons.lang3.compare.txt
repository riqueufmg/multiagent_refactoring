    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.compare",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and a total of 288 LOC, which is not excessively large for a package. The largest class (ComparableUtils) is 171 LOC with 10 methods, while the other two classes are small (43 LOC and 74 LOC). There is no extreme concentration of many classes or overwhelming LOC in the package, and dependency indicators (Ce=0, Ca=1, low fan-in/fan-out) do not suggest a single oversized component. Based on this contextual information, the package does not qualify as a God Component."
