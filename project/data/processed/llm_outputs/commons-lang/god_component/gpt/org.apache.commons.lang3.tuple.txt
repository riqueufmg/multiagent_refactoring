    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes and 795 LOC, which is moderate and does not indicate an excessively large component in context. Class sizes are evenly distributed (~113–159 LOC) with moderate WMC values (8–18) and no single class dominating the package. Coupling is low (Ce=1, Ca=1, fanin/fanout mostly 0) and cohesion metrics (LCOM values around 0.25–0.42) do not suggest a sprawling, unfocused component. Given these elements, there is insufficient evidence to classify this package as a God Component."
