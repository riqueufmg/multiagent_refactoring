    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package concentrates a large portion of its code in a single component/file: total package LOC = 947 while LockingVisitors (one class/file) alone is 440 LOC (~46% of package LOC) and LockingVisitors.LockVisitor is 215 LOC, so two nested types account for ~69% of the package LOC. The package contains 9 classes but the LOC distribution is highly skewed toward the LockingVisitors file with multiple nested visitor and builder types defined there, indicating centralized responsibilities and excessive size in that component. This concentration of functionality and large class/file size supports detection of a God Component."
