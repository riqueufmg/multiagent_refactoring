    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 13 classes and 746 LOC, which is moderate and the implementation is distributed across many small-to-medium classes rather than concentrated in one huge component. No single class dominates the package by LOC (largest classes: EntityArrays 106 LOC, NumericEntityUnescaper 95 LOC, UnicodeEscaper 94 LOC, CharSequenceTranslator 91 LOC) and class complexity (WMC) values remain relatively low (mostly <=13). Package coupling is low (Ce=1, Ca=1) and class fan-in/fan-out are zero for most classes, indicating responsibilities are not centralized into a single god component. Therefore, the evidence does not support labeling this package a God Component."
