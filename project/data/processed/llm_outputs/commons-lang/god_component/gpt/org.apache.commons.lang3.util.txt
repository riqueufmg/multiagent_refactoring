    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 463 LOC overall, so it is not excessively large as a component. Although one class (FluentBitSet) is dominant — 396 LOC (≈85% of package LOC), 44 methods (nom) and WMC 49 — the package as a whole does not have a large number of classes or an unusually high total size. The metrics indicate a concentration of complexity in a single class rather than an excessively large component."
