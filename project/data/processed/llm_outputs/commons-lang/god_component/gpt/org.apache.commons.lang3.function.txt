    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 61 classes and 2,551 LOC, which is large for a single component. In particular it houses very large, high-complexity classes: Failable (LOC=467, NOM=37, WMC=45) and MethodInvokers (LOC=122, NOM=13, WMC=13). Failable also lists many dependencies on other function types, indicating it centralizes a lot of functionality. Although many other classes are small functional interfaces, the high class count combined with substantial LOC and concentrated complexity in key classes shows the package is excessively large and likely bundles too many responsibilities, consistent with a God Component smell."
