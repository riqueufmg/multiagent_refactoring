    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=28, NOM=3, WMC=3 (low complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (indicates high cohesion). Low coupling and impact: fanin=0, fanout=0. DIT=1 and NC=3 do not indicate excessive responsibility. Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
