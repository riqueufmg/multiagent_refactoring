    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableFloat",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a moderate size (loc = 280) and a relatively large number of methods (nom = 32, nopm = 32), the internal metrics do not indicate an insufficient modularization smell. The class has very low lack-of-cohesion (lcom = 0.0625), suggesting high cohesion among methods; a low per-method complexity (wmc = 32 across 32 methods → average complexity ≈1) indicating methods are simple; very few fields (nof = 2) and shallow inheritance (dit = 1). Additionally, fanin and fanout are 0, showing it is self-contained. These elements imply the class implements a single, cohesive responsibility and further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
