    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: loc=153 and nom=11 are moderate (class size and method count not excessive), wmc=11 indicates moderate complexity, lcom=0.0 indicates high cohesion, fields=4 (few state members), nopf=0 (no public fields), and fanin/fanout=0 show no problematic coupling in the provided data. Dependencies are only two nested types (Processor.Type, Processor.Arch). Taken in isolation, there is no clear signal that the class needs further decomposition."
