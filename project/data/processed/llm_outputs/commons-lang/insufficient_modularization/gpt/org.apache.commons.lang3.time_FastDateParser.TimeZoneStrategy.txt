    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.TimeZoneStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (loc=109) and a relatively large number of fields (nof=7) while reporting no methods (nom=0). This combination suggests the class holds substantial state and/or multiple responsibilities that could be split into smaller, more focused units. Metrics indicating size (loc=109) and field count (nof=7), together with absent method decomposition (nom=0), justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity. Dependency footprint is minimal (depends on org.apache.commons.lang3.time.TimeZones), so responsibilities appear concentrated within this class rather than distributed, supporting the detection of Insufficient Modularization."
