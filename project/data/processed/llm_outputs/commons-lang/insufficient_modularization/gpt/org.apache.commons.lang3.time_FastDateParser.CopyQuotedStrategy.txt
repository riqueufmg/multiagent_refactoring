    "justification": "The class is small and contains no decomposable behavior: LOC=41, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, number of fields=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies). Given the absence of multiple responsibilities or internal complexity/size that would benefit from further decomposition, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
