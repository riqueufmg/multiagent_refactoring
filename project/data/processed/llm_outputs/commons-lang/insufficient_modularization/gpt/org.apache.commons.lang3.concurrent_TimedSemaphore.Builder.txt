    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: the class is small and not complex based on the provided metrics — loc=54, wmc=0, nom=0, nopm=0, nopf=0, nof=4. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although there are 4 fields (nof=4), there are no methods (nom=0) and overall complexity is zero, so there is no evidence from these metrics that the class requires further decomposition. LCOM=-1.0 does not provide a signal strong enough here to justify refactoring for modularization."
