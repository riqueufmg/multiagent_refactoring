    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class is relatively large (LOC=373) with substantial cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC=47) and many methods (NOM=27), indicators show it is a cohesive, focused abstraction: LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), no inheritance depth (DIT=0), and only an internal dependency (Range.ComparableComparator). The moderate number of fields (6) and presence of an inner helper suggest internal organization rather than mixed responsibilities. Given the high cohesion and minimal external coupling, further decomposition is unlikely to reduce responsibility overlap or meaningfully simplify the implementation, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
