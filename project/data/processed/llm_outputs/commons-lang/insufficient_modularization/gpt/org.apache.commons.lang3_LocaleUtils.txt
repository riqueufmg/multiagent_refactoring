    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=291), high implementation complexity (wmc=43), many methods (nom=21, nopm=11) and several fields (nof=7) indicating substantial responsibility concentrated in one class. External coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0), so the complexity is internal and amenable to decomposition. Although cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.333), it does not offset the class' size and complexity, so further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
