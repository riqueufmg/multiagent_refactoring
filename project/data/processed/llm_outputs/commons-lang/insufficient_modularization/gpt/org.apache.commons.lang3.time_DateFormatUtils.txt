    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Multiple signs indicate insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc=251) with many members (nof=15 fields, nom=18 methods) and most methods/fields exposed (nopm=17 public methods, nopf=14 public fields), moderate-to-high implementation complexity (wmc=18), and low cohesion (lcom=0.611). Additionally dit=0 (no inheritance decomposition) and zero fan-in/fan-out suggest the class is monolithic. These factors together suggest the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
