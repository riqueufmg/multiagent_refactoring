    "justification": "False — metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class is small (loc=35), has only one field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0). There are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These values show no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would justify further decomposition."
