    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.NumberStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 68) while exposing no methods (nom = 0) and only a single field (nof = 1). Complexity metrics show wmc = 0 and lcom = -1.0 (non-informative), and there are no dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). The combination of substantial LOC with no declared methods suggests behavior is not decomposed into smaller, cohesive methods or helper types within this class, indicating it is a candidate for further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
