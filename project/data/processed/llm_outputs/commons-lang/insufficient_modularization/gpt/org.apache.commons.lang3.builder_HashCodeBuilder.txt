    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.HashCodeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 507) and high implementation complexity (wmc = 72) combined with a large number of methods (nom = 37, nopm = 31) indicate the class is doing many responsibilities and could be decomposed. DIT = 1 shows little or no decomposition via inheritance; nof = 5 (few fields) suggests complexity arises from behavior rather than state, increasing the benefit of splitting behavior into smaller classes. lcom = 0.162 indicates reasonable cohesion but does not offset the high LOC/WMC and method count — the class is large and complex enough that further modularization would likely reduce size and per-class complexity. Dependencies are limited (3 listed), so decomposition would not be prevented by heavy coupling to other classes."
