    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.MemberUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits indicators of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 237), a non-trivial number of methods (nom = 14) and elevated implementation complexity (wmc = 37). These values suggest the class concentrates substantial behavior that could be split to reduce size and complexity. Although cohesion is acceptable (lcom = 0.2857) and it has a small number of fields (nof = 4), the high LOC and WMC justify considering further decomposition to improve maintainability."
