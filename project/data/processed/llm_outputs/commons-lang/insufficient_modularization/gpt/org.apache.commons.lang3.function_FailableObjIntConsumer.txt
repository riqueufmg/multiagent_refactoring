    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableObjIntConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 1 field (nof=1), small size (loc=30) and very low complexity (wmc=2). Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0) and there are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is small, simple and cohesive, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
