    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, NOM=2, WMC=2, NOF=1. Low complexity and size (WMC and LOC) and minimal public surface (2 methods) indicate no need for further decomposition. Cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) and zero fanin/fanout also argue the class is self-contained. Based on these metrics, there is no indication of insufficient modularization when the class is considered in isolation."
