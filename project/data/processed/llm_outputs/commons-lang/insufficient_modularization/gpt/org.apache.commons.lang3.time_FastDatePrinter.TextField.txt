    "justification": "Class has low size and complexity: loc=35, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=2. Coupling and usage indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Cohesion metric does not indicate unstructured internal complexity (lcom=-1.0). Given the small number of fields, no methods, and low complexity, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
