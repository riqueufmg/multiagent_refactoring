    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being too large or complex: loc=39 (small size), nof=1 (only one field), nom=0/nopm=0 (no significant number of methods), wmc=0 (no measurable method complexity). Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and LCOM=-1.0 indicates no detected cohesion problems. Given the small size, low complexity, and minimal dependencies, there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization."
