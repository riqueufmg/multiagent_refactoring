    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class large or complex enough to require further decomposition: LOC=29 (small), NOM=3 with NOPM=2 (few methods/public API), WMC=3 (low complexity), NOF=2 (few fields). Coupling is minimal (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) and there is no evidence of high implementation complexity or size. LCOM=1.0 does not, in this context, outweigh the small size and low complexity signals. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
