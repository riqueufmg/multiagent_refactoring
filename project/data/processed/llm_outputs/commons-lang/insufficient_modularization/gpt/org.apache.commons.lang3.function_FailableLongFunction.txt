    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=28, NOM=2, NOF=1, WMC=2. Low complexity (WMC=2) and small size (LOC=28, only 2 methods) indicate no need for further decomposition. High cohesion indicated by LCOM=-1.0 and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) further support that the class is already well-modularized in isolation."
