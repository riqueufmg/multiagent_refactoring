    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows strong indicators of being insufficiently modularized: very large size (loc = 1095), high method count (nom = 67) including many public methods (nopm = 59), and high complexity (wmc = 128). It also contains a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 14). While cohesion (lcom = 0.2687) is not extremely low, the combination of large size, many methods and high complexity suggests multiple responsibilities or implementation areas that could be split into smaller classes or utility components. The presence of several related dependencies (TimeZones, FastDateParser, LocaleUtils, ModifyType) further implies the class coordinates multiple concerns rather than a single narrowly focused responsibility, supporting the conclusion that decomposition would reduce size and implementation complexity."
