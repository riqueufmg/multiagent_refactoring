    "justification": "The class does not exhibit size or complexity indicative of Insufficient Modularization. Metrics: loc=42, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), nof=2 (fields), nopf=0, nopm=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, nc=0, dit=2, lcom=-1.0 (not indicating cohesion issues). With no methods, low LOC, zero coupling and zero complexity, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
