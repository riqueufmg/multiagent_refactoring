    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharSequenceUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 271) and high complexity (wmc = 63) combined with a moderate number of methods (nom = 9) indicate multiple responsibilities bundled together. The cohesion metric is low (lcom = 0.6666666666666666), suggesting methods are not tightly related and could be split into smaller, more focused units. The class holds 2 fields and depends on external utilities (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils), which further suggests extraction of responsibilities into dedicated modules or helper classes could reduce size and complexity."
