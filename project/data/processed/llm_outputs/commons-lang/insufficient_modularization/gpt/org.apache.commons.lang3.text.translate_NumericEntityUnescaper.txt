    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.NumericEntityUnescaper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc=95) combined with high implementation complexity (wmc=13) concentrated in very few methods (nom=3, nopm=3). It has almost no state (nof=1) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), which indicates the class likely contains substantial internal logic rather than distributed responsibilities. These metrics together suggest the implementation can be decomposed into smaller methods or helper classes to reduce method complexity and class size."
