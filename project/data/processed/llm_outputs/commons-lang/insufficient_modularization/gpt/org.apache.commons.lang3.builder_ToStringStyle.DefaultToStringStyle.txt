    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=22, NOM=0, WMC=0. It has no methods to decompose, no fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one field (nof=1). LCOM is -1.0 which here reflects lack of methods rather than poor cohesion. DIT=1 indicates a single-level inheritance but does not imply excessive size or complexity. Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it is insufficiently modular or that further decomposition is warranted."
