    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it defines a large number of methods (nom=17, of which nopm=14 are public) and moderate size (loc=170) while accumulating high implementation complexity (wmc=25). Cohesion is only moderate (lcom=0.4117647058823529), suggesting multiple responsibilities or behavioral clusters within the class. It has only one field (nof=1) and no inheritance (dit=0), consistent with a utility-type class that may be bundling distinct concerns. The variety of external dependencies (StringUtils, LongRange, NumberUtils and several Failable functional types) further indicates the class is handling multiple kinds of operations. Together these metrics justify that the class could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
