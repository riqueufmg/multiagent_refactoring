    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=56, only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2), low cohesion metric (LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion). Complexity is moderate but not excessive (WMC=10) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). There is no coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no external dependencies. These factors indicate the class does not need further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
