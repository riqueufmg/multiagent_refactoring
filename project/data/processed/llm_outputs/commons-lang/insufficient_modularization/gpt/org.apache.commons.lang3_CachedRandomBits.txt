    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CachedRandomBits",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: it is small (LOC=67), has few methods (nom=2, nopm=1), low complexity (WMC=6), and high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Although it has 7 fields (nof=7), the low method count and cohesion indicate those fields are likely related to a single responsibility rather than a large undecomposed implementation. Fan-in and fan-out are zero, so there are no external coupling indicators requiring decomposition. These metrics collectively justify that further decomposition is not indicated."
