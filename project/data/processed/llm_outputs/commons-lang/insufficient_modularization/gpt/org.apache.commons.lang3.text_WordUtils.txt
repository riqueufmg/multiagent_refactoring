    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.WordUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it contains a high number of methods (nom = 15, nopm = 14 public methods) and a large implementation size (loc = 304) while its complexity is high (wmc = 51). These values indicate many responsibilities and concentrated complexity in a single class. The class has no fields (nof = 0), suggesting it is behavior-heavy (utility-like) rather than stateful, which often benefits from decomposing behavior into smaller, focused modules. The single listed dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils) and zero fan-in/fan-out do not mitigate the internal size/complexity signals, so further decomposition is recommended."
