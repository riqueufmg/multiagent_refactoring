    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=42, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods contributing to implementation complexity and cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate decomposability. Given these metrics and analyzing the class in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
