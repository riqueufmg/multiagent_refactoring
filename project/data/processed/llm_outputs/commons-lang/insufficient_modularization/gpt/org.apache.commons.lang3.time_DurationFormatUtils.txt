    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationFormatUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 561) and high implementation complexity (WMC = 85). It contains many fields (nof = 15) and a moderate number of methods (nom = 12, nopm = 9) but a high complexity-per-method ratio (WMC/nom ≈ 7.1), indicating large or complex methods that could be split. The class is self-contained (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and even contains an internal Token dependency, suggesting multiple responsibilities (parsing/formatting logic) are bundled into one unit. Although LCOM is low (0.1667) implying cohesion, the absolute size and complexity metrics (LOC and WMC) justify refactoring by decomposing the class into smaller modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
