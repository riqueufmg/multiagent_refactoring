    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ClassUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (LOC = 1088), large number of methods (NOM = 66) with most public (NOPM = 59), and high complexity (WMC = 157). Cohesion is only moderate (LCOM = 0.5303), and it has many fields (NOF = 14, NOPF = 4). These metrics indicate multiple responsibilities and high implementation complexity concentrated in a single class, suggesting it should be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
