    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=44, number of fields (nof)=3, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted methods complexity (wmc)=0. Cohesion measure (lcom=-1.0) and lack of incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) provide no evidence of high complexity or responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition. Therefore there is no indication of insufficient modularization in isolation."
