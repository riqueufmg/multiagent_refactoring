    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate clear insufficient modularization. Although the class is moderately sized (loc=273) with several methods (nom=14, nopm=13) and fields (nof=9) and moderate complexity (wmc=23), the low lack-of-cohesion value (lcom=0.2857) indicates the methods are cohesive and likely related to a single responsibility. There is no extreme complexity or high fragmentation of responsibilities (e.g., very high WMC or very high LCOM) that would justify further decomposition in isolation."
