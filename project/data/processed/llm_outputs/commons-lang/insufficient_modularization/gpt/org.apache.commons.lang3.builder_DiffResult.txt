    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an oversized or monolithic class that needs decomposition: LOC is moderate (101), number of methods is modest (nom=9, public methods=8), WMC is low-to-moderate (10), and number of fields is small (nof=6, public fields=1). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0) and there is no inheritance complexity (dit=0). Coupling/external interaction is low (few dependencies and fanin/fanout=0). These elements suggest the class is focused and sufficiently modular, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
