    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 620), very high implementation complexity (wmc = 115), and many methods (nom = 31) of which almost all are public (nopm = 29), indicating a large public surface and likely multiple responsibilities. Although LCOM is 0.1935 (some cohesion), the combination of high LOC, high WMC and numerous public methods suggests the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split into smaller, focused classes or helpers to reduce size and complexity."
