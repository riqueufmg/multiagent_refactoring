    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=44, number of fields=2, number of methods=0 (nom=0), weighted methods complexity WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. Given the lack of methods, low size and complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no indication this class requires further decomposition (no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity)."
