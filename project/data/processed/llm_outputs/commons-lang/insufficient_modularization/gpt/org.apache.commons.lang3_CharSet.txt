    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=159 is moderate but not excessive; NOM=8 and NOPM=5 show a small number of methods/public methods; WMC=18 is slightly elevated but spread over few methods rather than many responsibilities; LCOM=0.25 indicates good cohesion (methods are related); FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 show low coupling. Taken in isolation, the class size, cohesion and coupling do not justify further decomposition."
