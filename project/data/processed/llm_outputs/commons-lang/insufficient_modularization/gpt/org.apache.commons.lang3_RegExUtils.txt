    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.RegExUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of methods (nom = 21, nopm = 20) and a wide public API surface, combined with substantial implementation size (loc = 280) and elevated complexity (wmc = 26). These indicate multiple behaviors concentrated in one class. Although cohesion is not extremely low (lcom = 0.333), the high method count and complexity in a single class suggest it can be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. Additional supporting signs: only one field (nof = 1) and no incoming/outgoing coupling recorded (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), showing it is a standalone utility-like class that is a good candidate for splitting into smaller, focused modules."
