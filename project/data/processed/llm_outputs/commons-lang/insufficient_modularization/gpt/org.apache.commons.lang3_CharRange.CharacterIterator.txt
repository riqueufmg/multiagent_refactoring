    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharRange.CharacterIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has LOC=89, other metrics do not indicate undue size or complexity: nom=0 and wmc=0 (no recorded method complexity), nc=0, nof=3 (small number of fields), lcom=-1.0 (indicates high cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no external coupling). Dependency list contains only org.apache.commons.lang3.CharRange. Taken in isolation, these values do not provide evidence that the class has multiple responsibilities or excessive complexity that would justify further decomposition."
