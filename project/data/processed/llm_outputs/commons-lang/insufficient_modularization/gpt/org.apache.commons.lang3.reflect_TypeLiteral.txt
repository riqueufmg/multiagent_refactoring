    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=39, NOM=5, NOF=3, WMC=7 and LCOM=0.0. There are no nested classes (NC=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1), and no incoming/outgoing coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0) aside from a single dependency on TypeUtils. Given the low size, modest complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or needs further decomposition."
