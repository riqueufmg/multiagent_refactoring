    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC = 74, number of methods = 7, WMC = 9 (moderate complexity) and LCOM = 0.2857 (low lack-of-cohesion). It has only 2 fields, no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and no excessive public surface (nopm = 7 equals nom). Given the modest size, moderate complexity and good cohesion, there is no evidence in the provided metrics that further decomposition is required."
