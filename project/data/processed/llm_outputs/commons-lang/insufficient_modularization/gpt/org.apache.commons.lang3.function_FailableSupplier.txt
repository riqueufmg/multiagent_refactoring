    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=29), has very few methods (nom=2) and low complexity (wmc=2), a single field (nof=1), and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is 0 (dit=0). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and well-focused, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
