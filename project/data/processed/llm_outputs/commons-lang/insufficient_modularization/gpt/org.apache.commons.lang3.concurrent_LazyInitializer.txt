    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.LazyInitializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate insufficient modularization: LCOM=0.8333 (low cohesion across methods), LOC=84 with NOM=6 and WMC=8 (moderate size and implementation complexity), DIT=3 (inherited complexity). The class has only 2 fields but multiple responsibilities suggested by dependencies (uses ConcurrentException, has a Builder inner type, and interacts with FailableSupplier and FailableConsumer), implying mixing of construction, error handling, and functional behavior. These signs (high LCOM together with method/count/complexity and multi-role dependencies) support that the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split to reduce size and complexity."
