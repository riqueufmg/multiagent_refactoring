    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and not complex — loc=29, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), nof=1 (single field). Cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0) and coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0) with no dependencies. Given the lack of methods, low size, low complexity, and no coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is necessary."
