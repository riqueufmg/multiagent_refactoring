    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and not complex: LOC=15, WMC=0, no fields or methods recorded (nof=0, nom=0), fanin=0, fanout=0. There is no evidence of a large size or high implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition. LCOM is -1.0 (apparently not applicable), so cohesion data is inconclusive, but the low LOC and complexity metrics justify not flagging Insufficient Modularization."
