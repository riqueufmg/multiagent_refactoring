    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that is insufficiently modularized: LOC is small (52), number of methods (nom) = 0 and WMC = 0 (no internal method complexity), number of fields (nof) = 1, fanin/fanout = 0, and only a single external dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableConsumer). LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate low cohesion here. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or low cohesion that would justify further decomposition."
