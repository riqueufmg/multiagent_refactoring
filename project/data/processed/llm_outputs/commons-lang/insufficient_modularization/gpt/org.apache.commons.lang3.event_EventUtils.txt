    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.event.EventUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows low size and complexity: LOC=84, NOM=3, WMC=3, NOF=3. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and the only listed dependency is an inner handler. Although LCOM=0.666 indicates moderate cohesion, the small number of methods and low complexity provide no strong evidence that the class has not been decomposed enough; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
