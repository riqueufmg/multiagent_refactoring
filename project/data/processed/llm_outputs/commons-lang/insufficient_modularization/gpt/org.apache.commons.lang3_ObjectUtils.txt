    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 703), large number of methods (nom = 52, nopm = 52), and high overall complexity (wmc = 82). Cohesion is moderate/low (lcom = 0.7307692307692307), suggesting methods are not tightly related. The combination of many public methods, high LOC and high complexity indicates the class likely groups multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
