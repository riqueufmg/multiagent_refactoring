    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (LOC = 2807), very high method and field counts (NOM = 205 methods, NOPM = 202 public methods; NOF = 193 fields, NOPF = 193 public fields) and high complexity (WMC = 206). These metrics indicate the class bundles many responsibilities and substantial implementation, so further decomposition could reduce size and complexity. (Dependencies limited to org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.ClassUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Suppliers do not counter the internal size.)"
