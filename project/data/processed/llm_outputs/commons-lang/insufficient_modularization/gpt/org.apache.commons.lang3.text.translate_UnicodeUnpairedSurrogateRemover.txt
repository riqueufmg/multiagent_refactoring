    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=17, nom=2, nopm=2 and wmc=2 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling that would motivate splitting for modularization. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
