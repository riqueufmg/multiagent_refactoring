    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that needs decomposition: LOC = 52 (small), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods/complexity to decompose), LCOM = -1.0 (no cohesion concern given absence of members), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (low coupling). No dependencies or internal complexity are present, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
