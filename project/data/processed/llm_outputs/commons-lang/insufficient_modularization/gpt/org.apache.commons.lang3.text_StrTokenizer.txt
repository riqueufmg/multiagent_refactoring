    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrTokenizer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 731) and high implementation complexity (wmc = 100); a very high number of methods (nom = 64) with many public methods (nopm = 55) indicating many responsibilities; a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 11) while having no inheritance (dit = 0) which suggests decomposition was not achieved via subclasses; these factors combined (large LOC + high WMC + high NOM) indicate the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity despite its measured cohesion (lcom = 0.0625)."
