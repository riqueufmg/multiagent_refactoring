    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class: small size (loc=34), low complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), moderate number of fields (nof=5) but zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion problem). These characteristics suggest the class is small and cohesive, not a candidate for further decomposition."
