    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, NOM=2, WMC=2 and NOF=1 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and fan-out=0 show no coupling evidence requiring decomposition. There is no metric evidence (large method count, high complexity, low cohesion, or many responsibilities) that further modularization is needed."
