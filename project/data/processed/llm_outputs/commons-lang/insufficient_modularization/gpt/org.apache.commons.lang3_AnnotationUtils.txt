    "justification": "LOC=268 and WMC=51 indicate high size and complexity; NOM=12 (NOPM=5) shows many methods including several public ones; LCOM=0.4166666666666667 (moderate cohesion) suggests methods are not highly focused; dependencies on multiple utilities (ClassUtils, StringUtils, ToStringStyle, ObjectUtils, ToStringBuilder) imply several responsibilities. Together these metrics indicate the class is large, moderately cohesive, and a candidate for further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
