    "justification": "Metrics indicate no smell: LOC=28 (small), NOM=0 and NOPM=0 (no methods to decompose), WMC=0 (no complexity), NOF=1 (single field), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (isolated), LCOM=-1.0 (cohesive), DIT=1 (shallow). Given the class has no methods and low size/complexity, there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
