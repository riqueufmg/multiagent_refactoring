    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableLongBinaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has a single method (nom=1), very small size (loc=15) and very low complexity (wmc=1). Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0) and there are no incoming or outgoing couplings (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These characteristics indicate the class is already small, cohesive, and simple, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
