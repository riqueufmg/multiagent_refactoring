    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.MethodInvokers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has moderate size (LOC=122) with a relatively small number of methods (NOM=13) and matching complexity (WMC=13), indicating methods are simple. It has no fields (NOF=0) suggesting a stateless/utility role, high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), and low coupling in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 4 listed dependencies). These metrics indicate the class is compact, cohesive, and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not warranted."
