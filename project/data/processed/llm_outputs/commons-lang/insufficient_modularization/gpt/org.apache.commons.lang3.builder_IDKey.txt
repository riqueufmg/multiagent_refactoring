    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=37, NOM=3, NOF=2 and WMC=5 indicate low size and moderate complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion (no evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities). DIT=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 and no external dependencies provide no indication that the class is handling excessive responsibilities that would benefit from decomposition. Therefore there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
