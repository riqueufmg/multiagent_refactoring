    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=44, no methods (nom=0) and low complexity (wmc=0). It has only 3 fields (nof=3), no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), and reported cohesion does not indicate decomposition need (lcom=-1.0). These metrics provide no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
