    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization. The class has moderate size and complexity (LOC=219, WMC=17, NOM=15) but shows good cohesion (LCOM=0.2667). It has a small number of fields (NOF=5, NOPF=0) and a moderate number of public methods (NOPM=8). Fan-in and fan-out are zero, and it depends on a single type (org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableConsumer), so it does not appear to be a highly coupled, multi-responsibility \"god\" class that needs further decomposition. Based on these elements in isolation, there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
