    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.Iso8601_Rule",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=62), very low complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0) and only a few fields (nof=4) — suggesting the class is small and simple. High cohesion is implied (lcom=-1.0) and there are no external interactions (fanin=0, fanout=0). Based on these elements taken in isolation, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
