    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayFill",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has many behaviors and moderate size: nom=11 methods (nopm=10 public/non-private methods) and loc=146, which indicates multiple responsibilities bundled in one class. The complexity is relatively high (wmc=22), suggesting method-level complexity that could be reduced by splitting responsibilities. The class has no fields (nof=0), implying a stateless utility-style class with many methods that can be modularized into smaller, focused classes or helper modules. The cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not indicate strong cohesion. Given these elements (high method count, many public methods, moderate LOC, elevated WMC, and lack of internal state), further decomposition is likely to reduce size and implementation complexity."
