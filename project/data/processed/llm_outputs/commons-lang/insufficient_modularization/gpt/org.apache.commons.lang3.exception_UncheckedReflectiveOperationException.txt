    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=14, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1, LCOM=0.0. Low complexity and single method/field indicate a single responsibility. No incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1) provide no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
