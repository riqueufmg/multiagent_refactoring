    "justification": "Class is small and has no behavior to decompose: LOC=27, NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no complexity), NOF=1 (one field), FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, dependencies empty. LCOM is -1.0 (no meaningful cohesion metric when there are no methods). Given the lack of methods and low size/complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
