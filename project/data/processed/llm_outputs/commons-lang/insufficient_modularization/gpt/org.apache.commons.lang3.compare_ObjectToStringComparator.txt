    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small size (loc=43), very small interface and implementation (nom=2, nopm=2), minimal fields (nof=2, nopf=1), and moderate complexity (wmc=8) that is not excessive. Coupling is nil (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no inheritance depth (dit=0). Given the limited LOC, method count and lack of external dependencies, there is no evidence this class should be further decomposed."
