    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, monolithic class: LOC is small (53), number of methods is low (nom=5), cyclomatic/weighted method count is low (wmc=5), only one field (nof=1), and cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.4). Fan-in and fan-out are zero, so the class is not a large hub of responsibilities. These elements collectively argue against Insufficient Modularization."
