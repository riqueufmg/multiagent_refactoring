    "justification": "The class is minimal and does not meet the symptoms of Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=6), no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no internal coupling reported (lcom=-1.0), and no external dependencies or interactions (fanin=0, fanout=0). With no substantive implementation to decompose, further modularization is not applicable."
