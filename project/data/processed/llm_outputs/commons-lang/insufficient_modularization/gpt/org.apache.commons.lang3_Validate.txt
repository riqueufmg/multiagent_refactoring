    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Validate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=797), high complexity (wmc=92), many methods (nom=54, nopm=52) and many fields (nof=20) indicating multiple responsibilities. Cohesion is low (lcom=0.925925925925926), suggesting methods are not tightly related and the class could be split into focused units. These metrics together justify refactoring into smaller, more cohesive classes or modules."
