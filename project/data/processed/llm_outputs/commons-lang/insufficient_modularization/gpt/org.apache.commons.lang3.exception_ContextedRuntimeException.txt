    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is moderate in size (loc=126) with 14 methods (nom=14) and a WMC of 15, but shows high cohesion (lcom=0.1428571428571428) and only 2 fields (nof=2). It has minimal inheritance depth (dit=1), no measured incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two related exception-context dependencies. Given the low LCOM (indicating methods are related) and the modest overall complexity, there is no clear indication that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity — therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
