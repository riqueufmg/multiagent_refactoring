    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.TimeZoneNameRule",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=35, WMC=0, NOM=0 and only 4 fields (NOF=4). It has no measured methods or cyclomatic complexity to decompose (NOM=0, WMC=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and therefore shows no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. These metrics indicate the class is already simple and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
