    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 764), high complexity (wmc = 77), many fields (nof = 46) and many methods (nom = 28, public methods = 12). It also references multiple nested/strategy types (FastDateParser.ISO8601TimeZoneStrategy, FastDateParser.Strategy, FastDateParser.StrategyAndWidth, FastDateParser.StrategyParser) indicating multiple responsibilities that could be extracted. Taken in isolation, these metrics indicate the class likely bundles too much functionality and would benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
