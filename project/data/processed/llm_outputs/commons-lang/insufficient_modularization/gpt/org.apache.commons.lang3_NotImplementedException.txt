    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.NotImplementedException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: modest size (LOC=81), low-to-moderate complexity (WMC=8) and a small number of methods (NOM=8). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no inheritance depth or children (DIT=0, NC=0). Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5) but not so low as to clearly warrant decomposition. Given these values and considering the class in isolation, there is insufficient evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
