    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: 87 LOC, 6 methods (nom=6, nopm=6) and WMC=8, which do not indicate an overly large or complex implementation that needs further decomposition. It has no inheritance depth (DIT=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one external dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils). Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5) but not sufficiently low to warrant splitting. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
