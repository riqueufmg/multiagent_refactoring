    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.TimedSemaphore",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and complex in isolation: LOC = 309, WMC = 30 (high cyclomatic/computational complexity), NOM = 21 methods with NOPM = 15 public methods (large API surface), and NOF = 17 fields (substantial internal state). It has only a Builder dependency and no inheritance (DIT = 0), which suggests this single class concentrates many responsibilities and could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
