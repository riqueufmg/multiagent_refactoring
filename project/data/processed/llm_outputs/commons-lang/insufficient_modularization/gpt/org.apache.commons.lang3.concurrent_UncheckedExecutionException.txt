    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=14, NOM=1, NOPM=1, WMC=1 indicate minimal size and complexity. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). These metrics show no need for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
