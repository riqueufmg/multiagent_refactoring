    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=76, 7 methods (nom=7), 2 fields (nof=2). Complexity is moderate (WMC=10) and cohesion is good (LCOM=0.2857). Low inheritance depth (DIT=1), no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no large number of public fields/methods indicate it has been sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
