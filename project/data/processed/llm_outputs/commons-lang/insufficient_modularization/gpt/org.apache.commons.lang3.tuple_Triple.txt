    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple.Triple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No: metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class is moderate in size (loc=122) with a modest number of methods (nom=12, nopm=12) and moderate complexity (wmc=14). Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.4167). There is no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no coupling via dependencies reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). These factors suggest the class is reasonably cohesive and not large/complex enough in isolation to warrant further decomposition."
