    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=16, number of methods=1, WMC=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0) and there are no dependencies or coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence of size or implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
