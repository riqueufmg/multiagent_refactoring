    "justification": "Class size and complexity are low: LOC=76, NOM=6, WMC=8. Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1). There are few fields (NOF=3) and no external coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency). Given the small number of methods, modest cyclomatic complexity and limited coupling, further decomposition is not warranted — no Insufficient Modularization detected."
