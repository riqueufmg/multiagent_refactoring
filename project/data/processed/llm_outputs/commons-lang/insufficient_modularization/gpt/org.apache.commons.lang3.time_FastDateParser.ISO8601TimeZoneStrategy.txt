    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=31), only 3 fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/behavioral complexity (wmc=0). No incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (dit=0). Given the class-level metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
