    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Strings",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class appears monolithic and a candidate for further decomposition: loc = 563 (large source size), nom = 28 (many methods) with nopm = 24 public methods, and wmc = 61 (high implementation/complexity). It also declares nof = 6 fields and has nc = 2 constructors while dit = 0 (no inheritance decomposition), suggesting responsibilities are concentrated in this single class. Although lcom = 0.357 indicates moderate cohesion, the combination of large LOC, high method count, many public methods and high WMC supports a conclusion of insufficient modularization (the class is large/complex enough that splitting responsibilities into smaller classes/modules would likely reduce size and complexity)."
