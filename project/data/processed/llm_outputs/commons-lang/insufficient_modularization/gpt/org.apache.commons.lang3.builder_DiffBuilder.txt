    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.DiffBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and complex in isolation: 421 LOC, 27 methods (nom) with 23 public methods (nopm), 15 fields (nof) and a high WMC of 38. These indicate substantial size and implementation complexity that could be reduced by splitting responsibilities. Although LCOM is low (0.074) suggesting internal cohesion, the combination of high LOC, many methods/public methods and high cyclomatic complexity supports that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization (extracting smaller helper classes or responsibilities) to reduce size and complexity."
