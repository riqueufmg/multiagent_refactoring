    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, NOM=2, WMC=2 indicate low size and low complexity. It has only 1 field and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=0 and LCOM=-1.0 suggest high cohesion. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
