    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=54, WMC=0. It has few fields (NOF=2) and no reported methods (NOM=0), very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). DIT=2 but that does not imply internal decomposition needs. Dependencies are limited to two functional interfaces. These metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would require further decomposition."
