    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: nom (number of methods) = 0, nof (number of fields) = 2, loc = 37, wmc = 0 (no complexity), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no coupling), dit = 1 (shallow inheritance), lcom = -1.0 (no cohesion problem indicated). Given the lack of methods, low LOC and zero complexity/coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
