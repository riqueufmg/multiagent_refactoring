    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has signs of insufficient modularization: total LOC = 198 while nom = 4 (average ~49 LOC/method) indicating large methods; LCOM = 0.75 showing low cohesion between methods; nof = 4 fields suggesting multiple state groups handled in the same class; presence of an inner type (org.apache.commons.lang3.Streams.FailableStream) indicates mixed responsibilities. Although WMC = 4 is low, the combination of high LOC and high LCOM supports that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and improve cohesion."
