    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small size (loc=50), very few fields (nof=2), no methods reported (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single external dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils). LCOM is -1.0 (no cohesion signal). There is no evidence from these metrics that the class is large, complex, or would benefit from further decomposition."
