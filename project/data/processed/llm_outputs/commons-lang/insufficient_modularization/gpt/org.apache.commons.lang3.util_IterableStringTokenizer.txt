There are no fields (nof=0) and LCOM value (-1.0) implies cohesion is not problematic in the provided data. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and only a single external dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils) is listed, indicating low coupling. These elements do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
