    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=17, wmc=0, nom=0, nof=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods or fields to decompose and low complexity measures provide no evidence that further modularization is needed. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected for this class in isolation."
