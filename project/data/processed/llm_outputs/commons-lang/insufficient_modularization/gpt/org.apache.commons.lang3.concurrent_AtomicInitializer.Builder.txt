    "justification": "The class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=16, number of fields=0, number of methods=0, WMC=0 indicate minimal implementation size and complexity. Coupling metrics are zero (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is 0 (DIT=0), so there is no evidence of sprawling responsibilities or complex interactions. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems in this isolated view. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
