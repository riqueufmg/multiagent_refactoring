    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DatePrinter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) and 100 lines of code (loc=100), indicating substantial size; WMC=13 shows moderate accumulated complexity concentrated in this class; LCOM=-1.0 suggests poor cohesion (multiple responsibilities or low internal relatedness); it declares no fields (nof=0) meaning the class is primarily behavior-heavy rather than data-centric; zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) implies it is isolated and can be refactored with low impact; two constructors (nc=2) increase its surface area. Together these elements indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
