    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableDouble",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a non-trivial size (loc=280) and a relatively large number of methods (nom=32) with WMC=32, the internal evidence does not indicate insufficient modularization. The class maintains very small state (nof=2) and shows high cohesion (lcom=0.0625), implying methods operate on the same responsibilities. Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). Taken in isolation, these metrics suggest a focused, cohesive class rather than one that should be decomposed further."
