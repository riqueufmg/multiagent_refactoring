    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: although LOC is 106, the class shows no methods (nom=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0), has only 5 fields (nof=5), zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and a negative LCOM (-1.0) indicating high cohesion. With these metrics in isolation there is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
