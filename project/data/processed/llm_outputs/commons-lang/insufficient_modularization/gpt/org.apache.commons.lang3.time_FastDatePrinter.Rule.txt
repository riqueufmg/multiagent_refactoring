    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=17, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods or fields to decompose, and the lack of dependencies indicates no internal aggregation of responsibilities. Metrics do not show size or complexity that would suggest further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
