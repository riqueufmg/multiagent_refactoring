    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharSetUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has a modest size (loc=151) and a small number of methods (nom=9, nopm=6). Although the overall complexity (wmc=26) is non-trivial, the class exhibits strong cohesion (lcom=-1.0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating a focused utility role rather than multiple unrelated responsibilities. Given the limited method count and cohesive structure, there is insufficient evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
