    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=123 and NOM=10 show a modest size; WMC=19 (average complexity ~1.9 per method) is not excessively high; LCOM=-1.0 indicates good cohesion (methods are related); no fan-in/fan-out data suggests no hidden coupling that would force consolidation. Overall the class size, complexity and high cohesion do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
