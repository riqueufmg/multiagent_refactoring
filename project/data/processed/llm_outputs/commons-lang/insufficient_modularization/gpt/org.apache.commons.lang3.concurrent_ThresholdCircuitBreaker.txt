    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows low size and complexity (LOC=59, NOM=5, WMC=7) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). It has a small number of fields (NOF=3) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=2 is modest. Given the small footprint and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition would meaningfully reduce size or implementation complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
