    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class. Although LOC = 91, the class reports nom = 0 and nof = 0 (no methods or fields to further split), WMC = 0 (no measured complexity), and LCOM = -1.0 (no cohesion issues reported). Additionally, fanin = 0, fanout = 0 and no dependencies show the class is isolated. Based on these elements in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
