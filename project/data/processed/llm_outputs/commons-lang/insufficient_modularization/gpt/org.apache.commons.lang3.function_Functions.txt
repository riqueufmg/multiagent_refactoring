    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=78), low method count (nom=6, nopm=5), low complexity (WMC=6), very high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), no inheritance depth (DIT=0), no coupling to other modules (fanout=0, dependencies=[]), and no fields/constructors indicating large state (nc=0). These facts suggest the class is compact and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
