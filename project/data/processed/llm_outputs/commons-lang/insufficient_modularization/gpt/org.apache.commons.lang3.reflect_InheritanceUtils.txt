    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.InheritanceUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=34, number of methods (nom)=2, WMC=5 (low complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). No inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the small size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed; further modularization is not warranted based on the provided data."
