    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and simple (LOC=16), has no methods or fields recorded (nom=0, nopf=0), zero measured complexity (WMC=0) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1 indicates no meaningful cohesion data. These metrics show no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
