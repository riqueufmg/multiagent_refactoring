    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.EqualsBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 720), high implementation complexity (wmc = 126), and many methods (nom = 42, nopm = 34). These values indicate the class contains substantial functionality that could be split into smaller, focused components to reduce size and complexity. Although LCOM = 0.0 indicates cohesion, the combination of LOC, WMC, and high method count justifies further decomposition. Dependencies (ReflectionToStringBuilder, ClassUtils, Reflection, Pair) also suggest multiple responsibilities related to reflection and utility processing that could be modularized."
