    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableDoubleUnaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=56, number of methods (nom)=5, WMC=5 (low complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, nc=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
