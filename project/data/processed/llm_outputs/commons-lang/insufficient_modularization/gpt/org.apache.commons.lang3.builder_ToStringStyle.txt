    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 1694), high method count (nom = 113) and many public methods (nopm = 23) indicate it contains many responsibilities; high complexity (wmc = 191) increases maintenance cost; large number of fields (nof = 37) implies substantial internal state and likely multiple concerns. DIT = 0 (no inheritance to distribute behavior) and fanin/fanout = 0 (isolated) suggest the class holds behavior that is not delegated elsewhere, so it has not been decomposed. Although LCOM = 0.106 indicates some cohesion, the combination of LOC, NOM, WMC and NOF shows the class is too large and complex for a single unit. Dependencies are limited to utility classes (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, ClassUtils, ObjectUtils, Strings), so extracting internal responsibilities into smaller classes or strategy objects is feasible. These elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
