    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.TwoDigitMonthField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc = 29), no methods (nom = 0) and very low complexity (wmc = 0) mean the class is not large or complex and therefore unlikely to benefit from further decomposition. It has a single field (nof = 1) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). The available cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) does not suggest fragmentation that would require splitting. Based on these elements, decomposition is not warranted when the class is considered in isolation."
