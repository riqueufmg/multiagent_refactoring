    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits clear signs of insufficient modularization: it is very large (loc = 1132), highly complex (wmc = 102), and contains many members (nof = 42 fields, nom = 32 methods, nopm = 17 public methods). The dependency list shows numerous inner/nested rule and helper types embedded in the class (e.g. FastDatePrinter.Rule, TimeZoneNameRule, CharacterLiteral, StringLiteral, DayInWeekField, TwelveHourField, TwoDigitYearField, TwentyFourHourField, Iso8601_Rule, UnpaddedMonthField, TwoDigitMonthField, WeekYear, TextField, NumberRule, TimeZoneDisplayKey, TimeZoneNumberRule) which indicates the class holds many distinct responsibilities/implementations. Although cohesion is not poor (lcom = 0.15625), the sheer size, high complexity, and the multiplicity of embedded rule classes and fields make this class a strong candidate for decomposition into smaller, focused classes (for example extracting rule implementations and timezone/locale helpers). These elements together justify marking this class as suffering from Insufficient Modularization."
