    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not sufficiently complex to require further decomposition: LOC=51, NOM=6 (NOPM=5), WMC=7, NOF=1. Coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0, DIT=0) and there are no public fields (NOPF=0). LCOM=0.6667 indicates some cohesion loss but given the overall small size and modest complexity, splitting the class is unlikely to reduce implementation complexity or size—so insufficient modularization is not detected."
