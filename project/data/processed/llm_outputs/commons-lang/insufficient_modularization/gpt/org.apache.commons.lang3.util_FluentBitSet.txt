    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.util.FluentBitSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very high size and complexity (loc=396, wmc=49) and a large API/implementation surface (nom=44, nopm=44). It has only 2 fields (nof=2) but 44 methods, indicating many operations concentrated in a single class that could be split into smaller classes/modules to reduce size and complexity. Although cohesion appears high (lcom=0.068), the absolute method count, LOC, and WMC justify refactoring/decomposition to improve modularity and maintainability."
