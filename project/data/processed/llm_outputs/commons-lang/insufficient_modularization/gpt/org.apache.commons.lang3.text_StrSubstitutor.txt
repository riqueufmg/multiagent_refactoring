    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits excessive size and implementation complexity: LOC = 782, WMC = 98. It defines many operations and public surface area (NOM = 55, NOPM = 51) and holds multiple fields (NOF = 11). These absolute metrics indicate the class is large and likely aggregates multiple responsibilities that could be split to reduce size and complexity. (LCOM = 0.181818 suggests reasonable cohesion, but the high LOC, WMC and method count still justify further decomposition.)"
