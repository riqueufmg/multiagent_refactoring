    "justification": "Class-level metrics indicate a large, complex class that is a candidate for further decomposition: very high lines of code (loc = 660), high weighted methods complexity (wmc = 97), many methods (nom = 34, nopm = 27) and many fields (nof = 18). These values show substantial size and implementation complexity concentrated in a single class. Although cohesion is reported as low (lcom = 0.0), the combination of high LOC and WMC and the high counts of methods/fields suggests multiple responsibilities or logical subcomponents that could be factored out to reduce size/complexity and improve modularization."
