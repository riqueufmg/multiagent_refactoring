    "justification": "Metrics indicate low cohesion and exposed state consistent with Insufficient Modularization: LCOM=0.75 (high lack of cohesion), nof=3 with nopf=2 (two public fields -> exposed responsibilities), nom=4 and nopm=2 (mixed public/private method split), loc=42 and wmc=4 (small but not simple enough to justify the cohesion score), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (isolated class holding unrelated data/behavior). These elements together justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and could benefit from further modularization."
