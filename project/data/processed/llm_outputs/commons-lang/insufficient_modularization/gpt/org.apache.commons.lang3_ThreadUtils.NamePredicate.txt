    "justification": "Class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 weighted method complexity (wmc=0), indicating no behavior to decompose. Small size (loc=22) and a single field (nof=1) imply low implementation complexity. No incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Therefore there is no evidence of an incompletely decomposed class requiring further modularization."
