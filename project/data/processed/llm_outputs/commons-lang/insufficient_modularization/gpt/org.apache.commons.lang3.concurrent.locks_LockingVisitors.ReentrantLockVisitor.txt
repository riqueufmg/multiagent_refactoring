    "justification": "Class has small size (LOC=53), zero measured methods/fields (nof=0, nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (WMC=0). Coupling metrics show no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate low internal complexity and no sign of a large, undecomposed responsibility, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
