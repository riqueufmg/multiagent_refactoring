    "justification": "Not detected. Metrics do not indicate an undivided large or overly complex class: LOC=99 and NOM=9 are moderate, WMC=13 is not excessively high, and NOF=2 (few fields). Cohesion is good (LCOM=0.222), inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1), and coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only two external dependencies. Taken in isolation, these characteristics provide no strong evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
