    "justification": "Class is small and simple: 28 LOC, 2 methods (nom=2), low complexity (WMC=2), single field (nof=1). Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size, low complexity, high cohesion, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity; insufficient modularization is not detected."
