    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, NOM=2, WMC=2 and NOF=1 indicate low size and low implementation complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 and no dependencies show limited coupling. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class has not been sufficiently decomposed; further modularization is not warranted."
