    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=12, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0. It has no coupling or dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]), no inheritance (DIT=0), and shows high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
