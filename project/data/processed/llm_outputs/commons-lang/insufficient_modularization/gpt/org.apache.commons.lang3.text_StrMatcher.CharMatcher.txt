    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=27), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). With no implemented behavior to decompose and no dependencies, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
