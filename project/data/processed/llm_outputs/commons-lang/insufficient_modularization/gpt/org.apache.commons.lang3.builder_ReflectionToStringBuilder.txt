    "justification": "Class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=440), high method count (nom=35) with many publicly accessible methods (nopm=29), and high complexity (wmc=52). These metrics indicate multiple responsibilities and concentrated complexity within a single class. Although cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.257), it does not offset the class size and complexity. The class also interacts with multiple external utilities (org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringStyle, org.apache.commons.lang3.ClassUtils), suggesting it aggregates functionality that could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
