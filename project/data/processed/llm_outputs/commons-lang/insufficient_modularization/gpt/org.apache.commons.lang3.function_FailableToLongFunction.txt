    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: loc=28, nom=2, wmc=2 and nof=1 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. dit=0 and fanin/fanout=0 show no complex inheritance or coupling to decompose. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
