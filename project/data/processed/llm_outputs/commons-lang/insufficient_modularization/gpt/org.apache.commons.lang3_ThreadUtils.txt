    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ThreadUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=389) with many methods (nom=25, public methods ~22) and moderate-high complexity (wmc=31). It also contains multiple nested predicate types (ThreadPredicate, AlwaysTruePredicate, ThreadGroupPredicate) suggesting distinct responsibilities bundled together. Although cohesion (lcom=0.2) is acceptable, the combination of high LOC, many public methods and multiple inner types indicates the class could be decomposed into smaller classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
