    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: loc=27, nof=2, nom=0, wmc=0. It has no methods to decompose, zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. LCOM does not indicate poor cohesion. These metrics indicate no need for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
