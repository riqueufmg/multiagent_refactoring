    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: moderate size (LOC=171), modest method count (nom=10, nopm=9) and complexity (WMC=10), high cohesion (LCOM=0.4), only one field (nof=1), and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Presence of an inner helper (ComparableUtils.ComparableCheckBuilder) shows some decomposition. These elements suggest the class is not overly large or insufficiently decomposed."
