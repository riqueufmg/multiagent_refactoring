    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class has a large size and high implementation complexity that suggest it could be decomposed: LOC = 243 and WMC = 43 indicate substantial code and cyclomatic complexity concentrated in a single class; NOM = 9 with NOPM = 3 (few public entry points) implies much internal complexity/private logic that could be factored out; dependencies on multiple utilities (org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemProperties, NumberUtils, RegExUtils) indicate mixed concerns (property access, number handling, regex) that are plausible candidates for extraction into smaller focused classes or helpers. Although LCOM = 0 suggests good cohesion, the combination of high LOC and high WMC alongside few public methods supports that further modularization (splitting complex internal behavior into separate classes or modules) would likely reduce size and complexity."
