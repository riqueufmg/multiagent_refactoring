    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=29, NOM=3, WMC=3, NOF=1. Low size and low cyclomatic complexity indicate no heavy implementation to decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion, the class has very few members, so the lack of cohesion does not imply a need for further decomposition. Therefore, there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
