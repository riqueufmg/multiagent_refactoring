    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=316), high complexity (wmc=22), many methods (nom=19) and fields (nof=8) which indicate a substantial implementation surface. The presence of nested/dependent internal types (EventCountCircuitBreaker.CheckIntervalData, EventCountCircuitBreaker.AbstractStateStrategy) suggests partial internal decomposition but not full extraction into collaborating classes. Although cohesion is relatively high (lcom=0.1579), the absolute size and complexity metrics justify further decomposition to reduce class size and implementation complexity."
