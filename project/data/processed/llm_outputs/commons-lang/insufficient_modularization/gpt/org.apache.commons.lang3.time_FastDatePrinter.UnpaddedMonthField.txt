    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=34, number of fields (nof)=1, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. These metrics indicate minimal size, no internal method complexity, and no coupling that would justify further decomposition; therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
