    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 89) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and no measured complexity (wmc = 0). This combination suggests a monolithic implementation (large block of code) that has not been decomposed into smaller methods or helper classes. Only 2 fields (nof = 2) and zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) indicate the functionality is self-contained rather than modularized. These elements together point to Insufficient Modularization."
