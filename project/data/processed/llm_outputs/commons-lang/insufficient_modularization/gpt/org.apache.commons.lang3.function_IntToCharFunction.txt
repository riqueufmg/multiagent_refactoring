    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity: loc=13, nom=1, wmc=1. Cohesion measure is high (lcom=-1.0) and there are no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). With a single method and low implementation complexity, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
