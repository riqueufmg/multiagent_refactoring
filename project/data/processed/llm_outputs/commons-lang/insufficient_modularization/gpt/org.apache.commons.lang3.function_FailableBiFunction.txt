    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, large, or complex class: LOC=44 (small), NOM=3 (few methods), WMC=3 (low complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is 0 (DIT=0). Given small size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence this class requires further decomposition."
