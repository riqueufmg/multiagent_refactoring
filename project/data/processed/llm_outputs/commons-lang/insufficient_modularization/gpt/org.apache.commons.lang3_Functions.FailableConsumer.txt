    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and has no internal complexity or multiple responsibilities: LOC=14, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, LCOM=-1.0. With no methods and minimal lines of code, there is no evidence that the class has grown large or complex enough to require further decomposition, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
