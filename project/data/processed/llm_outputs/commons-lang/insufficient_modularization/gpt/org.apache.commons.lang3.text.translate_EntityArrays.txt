    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArrays",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: 10 fields (nof=10) combined with 12 methods (nom=12) and only 106 LOC indicates a relatively large state footprint for its size; a weighted method count of 13 (wmc=13) signals moderate internal complexity that could be reduced by decomposition; LCOM=1.0 indicates cohesion concerns that suggest responsibilities may be separable; and the class is standalone (fanin=0, fanout=0, nc=0, dit=0), so splitting it would not require broad changes to other classes. These factors together justify recommending further decomposition."
