    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: modest size (LOC=62), low complexity (WMC=8), a small number of methods (NOM=8) and high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). No incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no deep inheritance (DIT=0) suggest the class is compact and focused; there is no evidence it should be further decomposed."
