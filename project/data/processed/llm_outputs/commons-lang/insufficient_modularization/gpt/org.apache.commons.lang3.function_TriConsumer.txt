    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=30, NOM=2, WMC=2. It has no fields (NOF=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion is not a problem. Given the low size, low complexity, and lack of internal/stateful responsibilities, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
