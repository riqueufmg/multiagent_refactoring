    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.GmtTimeZone",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has signs of insufficient modularization: relatively high number of methods (nom = 11) with many public methods (nopm = 9) indicating multiple responsibilities; elevated complexity (wmc = 15) for a small file (loc = 60) suggests methods with non-trivial logic that could be split; cohesion is moderate (lcom = 0.3636363636363636) rather than high, implying the class is not tightly focused. These combined metrics justify further decomposition."
