    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ExceptionUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and complex to remain a single module: LOC = 575, NOM = 42 (NOPM = 36 public methods), and WMC = 82. These values indicate a high implementation size and decision complexity concentrated in one class. Although LCOM = 0.1905 indicates reasonable cohesion, the sheer number of methods and overall complexity suggest the class has multiple responsibilities or large responsibilities that could be split to reduce size and complexity. The small number of fields (NOF = 3) and zero fan-in/fan-out imply this is a self-contained utility-style class that would benefit from decomposition into smaller, focused modules to improve maintainability and reduce cognitive load."
