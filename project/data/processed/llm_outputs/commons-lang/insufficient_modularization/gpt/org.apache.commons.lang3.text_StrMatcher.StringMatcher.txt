    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an insufficiently modularized class. The class is small (loc=39), has only one field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0), very low complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (dit=1), and an LCOM value (-1.0) that does not suggest poor cohesion. There are no dependencies listed. These elements show no signs that the class needs further decomposition."
