    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AtomicInitializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class groups multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed: LCOM=0.714 (reduced cohesion, suggesting multiple responsibilities), NOM=7 and WMC=9 with LOC=85 (moderate method count and complexity for a single class), presence of an inner Builder (dependency: org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AtomicInitializer.Builder) which increases class responsibilities, dependencies on both FailableSupplier and FailableConsumer plus ConcurrentException (indicating it handles initialization logic, supplier/consumer behavior and exception concerns). DIT=3 also increases conceptual complexity. These elements together justify that the class exhibits Insufficient Modularization and could benefit from decomposition (for example extracting the Builder and separating supplier/consumer handling)."
