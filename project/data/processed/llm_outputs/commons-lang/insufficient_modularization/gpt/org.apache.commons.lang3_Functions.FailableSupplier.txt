    "justification": "Class considered in isolation shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=14), no methods or fields reported (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no code churn/complex members (nc=0), low cohesion metric not indicative of internal complexity (lcom=-1.0), and no coupling to or from other units (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). There is nothing within this class that warrants further decomposition."
