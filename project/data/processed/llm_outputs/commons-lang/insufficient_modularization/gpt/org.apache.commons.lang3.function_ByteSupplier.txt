    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: 11 LOC, 1 method (nom=1), low complexity (wmc=1). It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and LCOM (-1.0) indicates cohesion. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
