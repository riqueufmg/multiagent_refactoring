    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=291 (large size), NOF=24 (many fields), NOM=17 (many methods) and WMC=17 (moderate complexity). LCOM=1.0 indicates low cohesion (members are not closely related), suggesting multiple responsibilities. The presence of several dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, Strings, CharUtils, text.translate.CharSequenceTranslator) and a relatively high count of fields and methods implies mixed functionality that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
