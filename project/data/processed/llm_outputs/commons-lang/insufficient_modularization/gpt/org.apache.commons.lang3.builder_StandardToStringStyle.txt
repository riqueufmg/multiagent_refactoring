    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: it defines a large number of methods (nom=41) with all methods public (nopm=41), has substantial size (loc=302) and cumulative complexity (wmc=41). It has only one field (nof=1) while many methods exist, and LCOM=1.0 indicates low cohesion. These metrics, considered in isolation, indicate the class is large, relatively complex and not well decomposed and would likely benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
