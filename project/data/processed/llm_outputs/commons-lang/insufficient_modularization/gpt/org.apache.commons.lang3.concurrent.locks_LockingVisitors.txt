    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size (loc = 440) combined with a small number of methods (nom = 6, nopm = 6) indicates the file contains substantial content beyond a few core methods (likely inner types). Dependencies list three nested visitor types (StampedLockVisitor, ReadWriteLockVisitor, ReentrantLockVisitor), which suggests multiple distinct responsibilities are implemented inside this single class/file. WMC is low (6) so individual methods are not complex, but the overall file size and presence of multiple visitor classes imply insufficient decomposition. Moderate cohesion (LCOM = 0.333) and limited external interactions (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) further support that the class can be split into smaller, more modular units without widespread coupling."
