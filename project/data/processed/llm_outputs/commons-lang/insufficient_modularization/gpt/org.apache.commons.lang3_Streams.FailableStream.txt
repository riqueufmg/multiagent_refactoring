    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted method count (wmc) = 0 show no internal method complexity to decompose; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 indicate no coupling-driven decomposition need; only 2 fields (nof = 2). Although LOC = 122 is moderately high, the absence of methods and zero complexity/coupling implies there is no clear, decomposable implementation within this class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
