    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and already simple: LOC=35, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=1, weighted method complexity (wmc)=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no external dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
