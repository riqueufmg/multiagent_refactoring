    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateFormat",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and complex: loc=422, nom=43 (nopm=38 public methods), wmc=44. The high method count and complexity suggest multiple responsibilities and implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposition. It also has a non-trivial number of fields (nof=8, nopf=4) and shallow inheritance (dit=1), indicating a monolithic class rather than being split into smaller modules. Despite a low LCOM (0.093) indicating cohesion, the absolute size and complexity metrics justify treating this as Insufficient Modularization."
