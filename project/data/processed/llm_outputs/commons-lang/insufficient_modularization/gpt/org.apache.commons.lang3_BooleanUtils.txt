    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.BooleanUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=674), high method count (nom=47, nopm=47 — i.e. virtually all methods are public), and high complexity (wmc=107). Cohesion is only moderate (lcom=0.489), suggesting multiple responsibilities or weakly related functionality. Nearly all fields are exposed (nof=7, nopf=6), and there is no inheritance decomposition (dit=0) to distribute behavior. These factors together indicate the class is over-large/over-complex and would likely benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
