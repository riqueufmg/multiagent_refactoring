    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: nom=3 methods and loc=41 indicate a minimal implementation; wmc=3 shows low complexity; lcom=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. There are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size, low complexity, and clear cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
