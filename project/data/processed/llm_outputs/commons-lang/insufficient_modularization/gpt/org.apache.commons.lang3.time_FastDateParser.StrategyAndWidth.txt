    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: loc=22, nof=2 (only two fields), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0, lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion). There are no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Given the very low size, complexity, and lack of multiple responsibilities or methods to split, there is no evidence that this class requires further decomposition."
