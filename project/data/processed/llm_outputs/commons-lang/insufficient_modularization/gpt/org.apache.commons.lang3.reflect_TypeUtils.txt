    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows multiple indicators of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 1363), high method count (nom = 59) with a large public API (nopm = 27), and high complexity (wmc = 236). These numbers indicate the class is implementing many behaviors/responsibilities and a large external surface. The class has relatively few fields (nof = 12) compared to methods, suggesting many methods could be logically grouped or moved into smaller focused types or utility components. Although LCOM = 0.2203 implies some cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high method count, and high complexity supports decomposing the class (e.g., splitting responsibilities, extracting helper classes or builders — note an inner type TypeUtils.WildcardTypeBuilder is already present) to reduce size and implementation complexity."
