    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.PaddedNumberField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class analyzed in isolation shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=37), very few fields (nof=2), no methods reported (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric is favorable (lcom=-1.0). These elements indicate the class is small, cohesive and not a candidate for further decomposition."
