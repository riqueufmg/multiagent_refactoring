    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.MultiBackgroundInitializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc=209) with few methods (nom=7, nopm=5) implying large/complex method bodies; moderate cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=14); non-trivial inheritance depth (dit=4) adding conceptual complexity; only moderate cohesion (lcom=0.4285714285714285) indicating related but not tightly focused responsibilities; and the presence of an inner results type (MultiBackgroundInitializer.MultiBackgroundInitializerResults) suggesting multiple responsibilities combined. These elements indicate the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
