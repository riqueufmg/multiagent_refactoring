    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.JavaUnicodeEscaper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show symptoms of insufficient modularization: it is small (LOC 59), has a modest number of methods (nom=6, nopm=5), low implementation complexity (WMC=6), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single dependency. These metrics indicate a focused, cohesive, and low-complexity class that does not require further decomposition."
