    "justification": "The class is small and highly cohesive: LOC=13, NOM=1, WMC=1 and LCOM=-1.0 indicate a single, low-complexity responsibility. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show no coupling suggesting internal aggregation of unrelated responsibilities. Given the single method and minimal size/complexity, there is no evidence it has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
