    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a relatively large utility container (loc=421) with many methods (nom=25, nopm=24) and moderate complexity (wmc=26). It declares numerous distinct nested/related functional types (e.g. FailableSupplier, FailableCallable, FailableBiFunction, FailablePredicate, FailableRunnable, FailableBiPredicate, FailableConsumer, FailableBiConsumer, FailableFunction, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBooleanSupplier) which indicates multiple responsibilities bundled into one file. There are no instance fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and the cohesion metric is not favorable (lcom=-1.0), suggesting the class is acting as a module of many loosely related utilities rather than a cohesive single-responsibility unit. These facts point to Insufficient Modularization — the class should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or interfaces."
