    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class metrics do not indicate a large or complex implementation that would benefit from further decomposition: LOC=52 (modest size), NOM=0 and NOPF=0 (no methods or fields detected), WMC=0 (no measurable complexity), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling to split). LCOM is reported as -1.0 (no reliable cohesion data). Considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or mixed responsibilities that would justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
