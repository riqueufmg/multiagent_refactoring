    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization when considered in isolation: it is small (loc = 61), has only 3 fields (nof = 3), no declared methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0), and no measured complexity (wmc = 0). Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and there are no dependencies. These metrics indicate limited size and low implementation complexity, so further decomposition is not indicated."
