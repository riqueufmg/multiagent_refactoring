    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableIntConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=41), low complexity (wmc=3), few methods (nom=3), only one field (nof=1), and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Additionally there are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics in isolation, the class is already small, cohesive, and not complex enough to warrant further decomposition."
