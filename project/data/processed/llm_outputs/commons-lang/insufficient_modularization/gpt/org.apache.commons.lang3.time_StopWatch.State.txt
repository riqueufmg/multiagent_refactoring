    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC=63 (moderate size) but NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods and no measured complexity), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling), dependencies empty. Given the class in isolation these metrics imply low implementation complexity and no clear need for further decomposition."
