{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Streams.ArrayCollector",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class considered in isolation shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=35), very low structural complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already small and simple, so there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
