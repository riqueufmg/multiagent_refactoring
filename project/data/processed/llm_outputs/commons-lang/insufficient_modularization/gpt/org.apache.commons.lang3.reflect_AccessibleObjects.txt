    "justification": "Class is small and sufficiently modular: LOC=25, number of methods=2, WMC=3 (low complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion), no fields (nof=0) and no external coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its small size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization or a need for further decomposition."
