    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.ConstructorUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: size is moderate (loc=185) with a modest number of methods (nom=9, nopm=8); complexity is moderate (wmc=17) and cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0), suggesting related responsibilities. Additionally fanin and fanout are 0, indicating no excessive coupling that would motivate splitting. Based on these per-class metrics, there is no strong evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
