    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=56), low complexity (WMC=5), small number of methods (nom=5), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), and no coupling complexity (fanin=0, fanout=0). These elements suggest the class is appropriately modular and does not require further decomposition."
