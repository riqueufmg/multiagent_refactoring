    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: loc=21, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), fanin=0, fanout=0. With no methods and minimal state, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that it contains concentrated complexity that would benefit from additional modularization."
