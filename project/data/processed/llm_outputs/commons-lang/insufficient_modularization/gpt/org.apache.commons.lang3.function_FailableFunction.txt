    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC = 74 (small size), NOM = 6 (few methods), WMC = 6 (low implementation complexity). Cohesion is high (LCOM = -1.0), and coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, no dependencies). Given these values, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
