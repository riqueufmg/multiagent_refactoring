    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=43), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0) imply the class has little or no behavioral implementation to decompose; only three fields (nof=3) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence of high complexity, large size, or multiple responsibilities that would justify further decomposition."
