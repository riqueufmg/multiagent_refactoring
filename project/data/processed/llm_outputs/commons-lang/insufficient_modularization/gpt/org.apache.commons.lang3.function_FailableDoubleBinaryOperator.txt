    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableDoubleBinaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: loc=15, nom=1 (one method), wmc=1 (very low complexity). Coupling metrics show no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Cohesion is not indicating fragmentation (lcom=-1.0) and there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities to split. Based on these metrics, there is no sign that the class has not been decomposed further; it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
