    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=91 and WMC=16 show a small-to-moderate size and complexity; NOM=15 with only NOPM=3 public API suggests many private helpers but not excessive surface area; LCOM=0.2 indicates high cohesion (methods are related) so the class is not doing unrelated responsibilities; NOF=1 and zero fanin/fanout imply limited state and coupling. Dependencies are minimal. Taken in isolation, these elements justify that further decomposition is not clearly warranted."
