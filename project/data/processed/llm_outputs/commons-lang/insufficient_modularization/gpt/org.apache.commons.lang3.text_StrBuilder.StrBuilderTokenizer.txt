    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=29 (small size), WMC=0 (no internal complexity), NOF=0/NOM=0 (no fields/methods to split), LCOM=-1.0 (indicates cohesion), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (low coupling), DIT=1 (shallow inheritance). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal/cohesive and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
