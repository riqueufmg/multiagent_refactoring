    "justification": "The class is not exhibiting Insufficient Modularization: it is small and contains no decomposable elements. Metrics show LOC=29, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable). With no methods/fields and no internal complexity or dependencies, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
