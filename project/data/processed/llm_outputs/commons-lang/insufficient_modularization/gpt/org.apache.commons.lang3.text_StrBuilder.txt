    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of being too large and complex for a single class: LOC = 2304 (very large implementation), NOM = 150 with NOPM = 145 (very many methods / large public API), and WMC = 341 (very high implementation complexity). Although LCOM = 0.2067 indicates reasonable cohesion, the sheer number of methods and high complexity suggest multiple responsibilities or sizable subcomponents that could be split to reduce size and complexity. Additional indicators: relatively few fields (NOF = 8) but a very large behavioral surface implies the class is behavior-heavy and would benefit from further decomposition. Dependencies on multiple string/utility helpers (StrTokenizer, StrMatcher, StringUtils, CharUtils, ArrayUtils, Strings) also imply varied string-processing responsibilities that could be modularized."
