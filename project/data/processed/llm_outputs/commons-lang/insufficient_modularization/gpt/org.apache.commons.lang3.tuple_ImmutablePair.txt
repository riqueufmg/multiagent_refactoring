    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC=136 (moderate size), WMC=11 (low-to-moderate complexity), NOM=11/NOPM=11 (reasonable method count), LCOM=0.2727 (high cohesion), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling pressure), DIT=1 (shallow hierarchy). Given the class-level cohesion and moderate size/complexity, there is no strong evidence that further decomposition is required."
