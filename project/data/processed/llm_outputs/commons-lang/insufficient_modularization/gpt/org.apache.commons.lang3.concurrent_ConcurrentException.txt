    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive. Metrics show LOC=40, NOM=4 (NOPM=3), WMC=4 (low complexity), LCOM=1.0 (high cohesion), and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These values indicate limited size and complexity and no clear candidates for further decomposition. The single listed dependency is minimal, so there is no evidence the class bundles multiple unrelated responsibilities that would justify modularization."
