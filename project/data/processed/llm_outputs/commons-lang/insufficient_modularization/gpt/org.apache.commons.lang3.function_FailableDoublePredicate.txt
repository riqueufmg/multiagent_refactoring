    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableDoublePredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=65, NOM=6, WMC=6 (low complexity), NOF=2 (few fields). LCOM=-1.0 implies high cohesion. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 show no coupling dependencies. Given the modest size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
