    "justification": "The class is small and simple, so further decomposition is unlikely to be beneficial. Metrics show LOC=41, NOM=3 and WMC=3 indicating low size and low complexity. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion among methods. NOF=1 (one field) and DIT=0 (no inheritance depth) further support low structural complexity. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show no coupling that would motivate splitting. Based on these elements, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
