    "justification": "Class has small-to-moderate size and cohesion: LOC=159, NOF=2, NOM=16 with LCOM=0.375 (indicating good cohesion). Complexity is moderate (WMC=18) but not excessive, and there is no inheritance or coupling pressure (DIT=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low number of fields and good cohesion, further decomposition is not clearly warranted from the provided metrics."
