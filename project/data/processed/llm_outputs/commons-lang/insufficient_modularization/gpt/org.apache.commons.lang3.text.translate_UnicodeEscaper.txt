    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. Size is moderate (LOC = 94) with a small number of methods (NOM = 8, NOPM = 6) and few fields (NOF = 3). Complexity is modest (WMC = 12). Cohesion is high (LCOM = 0.25), and there is no coupling pressure shown (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). DIT = 2 does not suggest an overly large inheritance hierarchy. These elements together imply the class is reasonably cohesive and not large/complex enough to require further decomposition."
