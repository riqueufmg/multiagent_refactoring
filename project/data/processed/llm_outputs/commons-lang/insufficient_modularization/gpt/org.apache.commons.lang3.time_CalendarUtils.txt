    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: modest size (LOC=164, NOM=19, NOPM=13), small number of fields (NOF=3, NOPF=1), and moderate complexity (WMC=20) but very high cohesion (LCOM=0.105). Additionally there are no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Together these point to a cohesive, moderately sized class rather than one that is insufficiently decomposed."
