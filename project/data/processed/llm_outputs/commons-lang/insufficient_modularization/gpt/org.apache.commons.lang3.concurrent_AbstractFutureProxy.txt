    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=37, nom=7, wmc=7 (low complexity per method), lcom=0.0 (high cohesion). It has a single field (nof=1) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). No inheritance depth (dit=0). Given small size, low complexity, high cohesion and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition (insufficient modularization) is needed."
