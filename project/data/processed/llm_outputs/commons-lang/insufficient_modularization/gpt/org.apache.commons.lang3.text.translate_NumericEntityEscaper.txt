    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.NumericEntityEscaper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows modest size and complexity (loc=78, wmc=10, nom=7) with only 3 fields and 6 public methods, indicating a small, focused implementation. Cohesion is reasonably high (lcom=0.2857), suggesting related responsibilities are grouped. Depth of inheritance is shallow (dit=2) and it has no external coupling in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate a class that clearly needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
