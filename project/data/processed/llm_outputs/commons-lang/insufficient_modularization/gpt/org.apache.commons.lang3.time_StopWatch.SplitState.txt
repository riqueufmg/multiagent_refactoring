    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no functionality indicative of insufficient modularization: loc = 4, nom = 0, nof = 0, wmc = 0, nopm = 0, nc = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dependencies = []. Given the minimal size and zero methods/fields/complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that it would benefit from additional modularization."
