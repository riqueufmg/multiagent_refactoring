    "justification": "Class considered in isolation does not show signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 53 (moderate size), NOM = 0 and NOF = 0 (no methods or fields to decompose), WMC = 0 (no complexity), DIT = 1 (shallow inheritance), LCOM = -1.0 (no cohesion concern indicated), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling/dependency pressure). No dependencies listed. These metrics indicate the class is small/low-complexity and does not require further decomposition."
