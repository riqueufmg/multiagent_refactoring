    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=56, NOM=5, WMC=5, NOF=1. LCOM=-1.0 implies high cohesion. Coupling and inheritance are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, DIT=0, NC=0). Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion in isolation, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition (no insufficient modularization detected)."
