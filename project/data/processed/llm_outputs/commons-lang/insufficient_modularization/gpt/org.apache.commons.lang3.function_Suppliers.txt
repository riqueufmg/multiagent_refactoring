    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Suppliers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=34, NOM=3, WMC=3 and only 1 field (NOF=1). It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). These metrics indicate low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that further decomposition would reduce size/complexity. LCOM=1.0 does not, in this context, outweigh the small size and low complexity indicators."
