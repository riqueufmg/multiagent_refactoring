    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization detected: large class size (loc = 312), many fields (nof = 12) and many methods (nom = 16) with almost all methods public (nopm = 15), relatively high complexity (wmc = 21), and low cohesion (lcom = 0.75). These indicators — high LOC, many responsibilities exposed via many public methods, high cyclomatic/weighted complexity, and poor cohesion — suggest the class is not fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization (splitting responsibilities into smaller classes/components)."
