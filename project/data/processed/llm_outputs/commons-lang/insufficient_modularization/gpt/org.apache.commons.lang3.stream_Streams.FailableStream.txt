    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.stream.Streams.FailableStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 121) while declaring 0 methods (nom = 0) and only 2 fields (nof = 2). Weighted method count and method-related metrics are zero (wmc = 0, nopm = 0, nopf = 0), and cohesion metric is not informative (lcom = -1.0). The high LOC combined with no decomposed methods or modular members indicates the class's implementation is not broken into smaller responsibilities, consistent with Insufficient Modularization."
