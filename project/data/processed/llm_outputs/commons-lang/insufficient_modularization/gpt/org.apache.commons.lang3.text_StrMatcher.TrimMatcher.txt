    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=21, wmc=0, nom=0, dit=1. Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0) and there is no coupling to other code (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size, zero measured complexity/methods and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
