    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 952), an extremely high number of fields (nof = 130) with almost all public (nopf = 128) indicating many bundled constants/state, moderate-to-high complexity (wmc = 29) across a non-trivial number of methods (nom = 23), and low cohesion (lcom = 0.739). The combination of large LOC, many public fields, and low cohesion indicates multiple responsibilities that could be split into smaller, more focused classes or modules. The listed dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemProperties, JavaVersion, StringUtils, Strings) further suggest the class interacts with multiple concerns rather than a single cohesive responsibility."
