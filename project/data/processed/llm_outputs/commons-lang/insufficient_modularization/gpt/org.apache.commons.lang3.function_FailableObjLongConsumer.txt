    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=30, NOM=2, WMC=2, NOF=1. Low complexity (WMC=2) and small size (LOC=30, only 2 methods) indicate it does not need further decomposition. LCOM=-1.0 suggests good cohesion. Fan-in=0 and fan-out=0 show no coupling context requiring split. Therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
