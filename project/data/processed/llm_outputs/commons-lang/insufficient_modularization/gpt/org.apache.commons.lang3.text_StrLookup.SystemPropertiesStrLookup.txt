    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being too large or complex: LOC = 11, WMC = 0, NOM = 0. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT = 1). There is no evidence of high implementation complexity or many responsibilities that would justify further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
