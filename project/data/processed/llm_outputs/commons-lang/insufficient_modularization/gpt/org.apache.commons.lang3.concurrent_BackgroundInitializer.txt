    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.BackgroundInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class is non-trivial in size (loc=235) with a moderate number of methods (nom=16) and cyclomatic complexity (wmc=21), indicators do not point to insufficient modularization. Cohesion is good (lcom=0.25), only 8 public methods (nopm=8) suggesting internal encapsulation, a modest number of fields (nof=5), and existing internal decomposition (nc=4 nested/inner classes including a Builder). Depth of inheritance (dit=3) and zero fanin/fanout indicate the class is self-contained rather than a large god-class. Taken in isolation, these metrics support that further decomposition is not clearly required."
