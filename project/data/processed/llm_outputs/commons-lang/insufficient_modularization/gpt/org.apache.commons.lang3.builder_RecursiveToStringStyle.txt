    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.RecursiveToStringStyle",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not overly complex: LOC=37, 1 field (nof=1), 4 methods (nom=4) of which 2 are public (nopm=2), and WMC=5. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating minimal coupling. Although LCOM=0.75 suggests some lower cohesion, the overall size and complexity are low and do not justify further decomposition in isolation. Dependencies on ReflectionToStringBuilder and ClassUtils reflect expected utility usage rather than evidence of an undecomposed large class."
