    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely case of Insufficient Modularization: it has a large size (loc=255) and high implementation complexity (wmc=28), with many methods (nom=26, nopm=26) and several fields (nof=5, nopf=3). Cohesion is moderate to low (lcom=0.538), indicating multiple responsibilities. These elements together suggest the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
