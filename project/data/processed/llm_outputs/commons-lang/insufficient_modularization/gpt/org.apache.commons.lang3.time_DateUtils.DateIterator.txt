    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=43), very low complexity (wmc=0), no methods reported (nom=0) and only two fields (nof=2). Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence of high implementation complexity or excessive size that would suggest further decomposition is needed."
