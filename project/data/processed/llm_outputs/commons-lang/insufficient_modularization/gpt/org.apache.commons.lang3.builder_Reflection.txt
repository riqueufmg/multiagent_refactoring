    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.Reflection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=20, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Given the single method, low complexity and lack of fields or dependencies, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
