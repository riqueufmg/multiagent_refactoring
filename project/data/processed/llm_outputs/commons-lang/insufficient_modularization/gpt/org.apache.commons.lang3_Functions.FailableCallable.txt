    "justification": "The class is trivial and does not show signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=14 (very small), number of methods=0, number of fields=0, WMC=0 (no internal complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). There are no responsibilities or internal complexity to decompose further; LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion issues given the absence of members."
