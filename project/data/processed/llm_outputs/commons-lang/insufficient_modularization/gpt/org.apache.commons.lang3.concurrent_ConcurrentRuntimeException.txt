    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=32, NOF=1, NOM=3 (NOPM=2) and WMC=3 indicate low implementation size and complexity. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency), and there are no subclasses (DIT=0, NC=0). Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion, the very small number of methods and fields means further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
