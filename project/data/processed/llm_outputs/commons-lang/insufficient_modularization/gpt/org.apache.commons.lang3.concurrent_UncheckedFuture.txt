    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: 44 LOC and only 5 methods (nom=5) with low overall complexity (WMC=5). The LCOM value (-1.0) indicates high cohesion rather than a monolithic collection of unrelated functionality. There are no incoming or outgoing coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no recorded dependencies, so there is no metric evidence that the class bundles responsibilities that should be split. Given these metrics, there is no indication of insufficient modularization."
