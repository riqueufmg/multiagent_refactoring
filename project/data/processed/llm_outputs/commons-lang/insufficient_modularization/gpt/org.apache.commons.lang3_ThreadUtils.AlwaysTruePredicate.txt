    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and low-complexity: LOC=14, WMC=0, NOM=0, no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). There are no methods to decompose and cohesion metric is not indicating fragmentation (LCOM=-1.0, likely not applicable). Given its minimal size and lack of complexity, it is not a candidate for further decomposition (no insufficient modularization)."
