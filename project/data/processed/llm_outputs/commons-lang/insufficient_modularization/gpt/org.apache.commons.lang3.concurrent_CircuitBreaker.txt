    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=36, NOM=6, WMC=6 (low complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). Single constructor (NC=1), no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
