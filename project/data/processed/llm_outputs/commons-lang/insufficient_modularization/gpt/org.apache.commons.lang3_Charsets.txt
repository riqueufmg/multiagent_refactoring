    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=31, NOM=3, WMC=3 indicate low size and complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. NOF=0 and NC=0 (no fields, no nested classes) and fanin/fanout=0 show low coupling/dependencies. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
