    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: loc=41, wmc=0, nom=0, lcom=-1.0. It has only 3 fields (nof=3) and no evident method complexity or coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Given the low size, zero method complexity, and absence of coupling or dependencies, there is no evidence this class has insufficient modularization."
