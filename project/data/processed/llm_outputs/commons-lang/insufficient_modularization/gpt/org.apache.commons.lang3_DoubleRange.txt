    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.DoubleRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=45, NOM=4, WMC=4 and NOF=1 indicate a small, low-complexity implementation. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show low coupling, so there is little interaction that would motivate splitting. Although LCOM=1.0 indicates limited field sharing among methods, the class has only one field and few methods, so the cohesion concern is minor given the overall small size. DIT=2 reflects inheritance depth but does not imply excessive internal responsibilities. Based on these metrics, further decomposition is not warranted."
