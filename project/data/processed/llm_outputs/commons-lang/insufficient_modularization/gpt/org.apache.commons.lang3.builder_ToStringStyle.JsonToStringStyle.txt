    "justification": "The class has a high size (loc = 169) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and only two fields (nof = 2), indicating a large block of code that is not decomposed into methods or smaller classes. WMC = 0 (no distributed complexity) combined with loc = 169 suggests functionality is implemented monolithically (e.g., large initializers or inline logic) rather than modularized. The cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) is not positive evidence of strong cohesion. These elements together indicate insufficient modularization and that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
