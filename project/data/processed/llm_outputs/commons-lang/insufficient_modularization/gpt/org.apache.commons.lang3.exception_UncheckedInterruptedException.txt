    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: loc=14, nom=1, wmc=1, nof=1, lcom=0.0. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. Given the single method/field, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
