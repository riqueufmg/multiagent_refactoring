{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modularized: it is large (loc = 467) with many methods (nom = 37, nopm = 35) and high complexity (wmc = 45), which typically indicates multiple responsibilities that could be split. Cohesion metric is negative (lcom = -1.0), suggesting low cohesion among members. It also depends on a wide range of distinct types (18 listed dependencies: FailableBooleanSupplier, FailableBiFunction, FailableDoubleBinaryOperator, FailableConsumer, FailableFunction, FailableRunnable, FailableShortSupplier, FailableSupplier, FailablePredicate, FailableCallable, FailableIntConsumer, FailableLongSupplier, FailableIntSupplier, FailableBiConsumer, FailableDoubleConsumer, FailableLongConsumer, FailableBiPredicate, FailableDoubleSupplier), implying the class handles many different concerns. Additionally, it has no depth in inheritance (dit = 0) and no recorded external interactions (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), which together with the other metrics point to a single, monolithic class that would benefit from decomposition into smaller, higher-cohesion components."
