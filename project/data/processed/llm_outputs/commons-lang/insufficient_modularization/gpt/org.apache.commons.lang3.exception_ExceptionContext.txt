    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ExceptionContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No: the class shows no signs of insufficient modularization. It is small (LOC=50), has a modest number of methods (nom=7) and moderate complexity (WMC=7). Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate the class needs further decomposition."
