    "justification": "The class is very small and contains no members: loc=11, nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0. It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is -1.0 (no measurable cohesion due to absence of methods). These metrics indicate no substantial size or complexity that would suggest it needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
