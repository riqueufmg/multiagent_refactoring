    "justification": "Class is small and simple in isolation: loc = 10, nom = 0, nof = 0, wmc = 0. Coupling and dependencies are minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dependencies = []). These metrics indicate low size, low complexity, and low coupling, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
