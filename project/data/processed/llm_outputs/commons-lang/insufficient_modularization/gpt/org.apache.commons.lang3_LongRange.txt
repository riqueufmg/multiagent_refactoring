    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=53), low complexity (wmc=5), limited number of methods (nom=5, nopm=4), high cohesion (lcom=1.0), and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Inheritance depth (dit=2) is modest. These metrics indicate the class is already appropriately modular and does not need further decomposition."
