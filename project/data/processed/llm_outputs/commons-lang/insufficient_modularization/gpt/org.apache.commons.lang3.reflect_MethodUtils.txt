    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.MethodUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 674), high complexity (WMC = 76), and many methods (nom = 34, public methods = 26) which suggests multiple responsibilities bundled together. Cohesion is only moderate (LCOM = 0.3235294117647059) rather than very high, implying the methods are not all tightly related. The class depends on a variety of utilities (ArrayUtils, ClassUtils, TypeUtils, MemberUtils, AccessibleObjects, LangCollectors), indicating it handles diverse concerns. Taken in isolation, these metrics and dependencies justify that MethodUtils is likely not sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
