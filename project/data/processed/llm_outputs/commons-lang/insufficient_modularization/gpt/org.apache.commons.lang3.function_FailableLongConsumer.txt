    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: 41 LOC, 3 methods, low complexity (WMC=3), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and modular; further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or implementation complexity."
