    "justification": "LCOM=1.0 indicates a strong lack of cohesion (methods do not share state). The class has 3 fields and 5 methods (4 public) with 89 LOC and WMC=5 — a moderate size and complexity that, combined with low cohesion, suggests multiple responsibilities that could be split. fanin=0 and fanout=0 show the class is self-contained, so internal decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
