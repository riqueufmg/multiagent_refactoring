    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableIntFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=28, WMC=2, NOM=2, NOF=1. Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0), and there are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no evidence it requires further decomposition."
