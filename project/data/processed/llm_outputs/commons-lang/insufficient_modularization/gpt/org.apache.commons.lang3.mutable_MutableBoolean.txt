    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 16 methods (nom=16) and a moderate complexity (wmc=17), it is small in size (loc=138) and contains only 2 fields. The LCOM value is 0.125, indicating high cohesion (methods operate on the same state), and there are no inbound or outbound coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the focused purpose implied by these metrics and the lack of evidence of multiple responsibilities, there is no indication of insufficient modularization."
