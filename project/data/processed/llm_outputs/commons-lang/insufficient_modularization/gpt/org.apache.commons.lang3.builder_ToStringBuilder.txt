    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=646) and large number of methods (nom=63, nopm=63) producing a wide public surface; high implementation complexity (wmc=68) indicating many branching/complex behaviors; small number of fields (nof=4) but many methods suggests multiple responsibilities implemented as behavior rather than state decomposition. It also depends on multiple collaborators (org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringStyle, org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionToStringBuilder), implying mixed concerns (string construction, style handling, reflection-based logic) that could be separated. Taken in isolation, these metrics (loc, nom, nopm, wmc and dependencies) justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
