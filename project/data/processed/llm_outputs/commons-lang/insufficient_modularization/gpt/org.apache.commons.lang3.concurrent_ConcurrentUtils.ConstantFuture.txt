    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=47, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods to decompose (nom=0), only one field, negligible complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling/dependencies. These elements provide no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
