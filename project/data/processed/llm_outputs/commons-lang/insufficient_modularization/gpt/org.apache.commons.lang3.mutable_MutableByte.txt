    "justification": "LCOM=0.064516129032258 indicates high cohesion; only 2 fields (nof=2) and a single inheritance level (dit=1) suggest a focused responsibility. Although nom=31 and loc=274 with wmc=32 show moderate size/complexity, the lack of fanin/fanout (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no external dependencies imply the class is self-contained rather than a large, multi-concern module. Therefore there is no strong evidence this class needs further decomposition."
