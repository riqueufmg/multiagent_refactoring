    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=28, nom=3, wmc=3. Cohesion not an issue (lcom=-1.0). No incoming/outgoing coupling that would indicate entangled responsibilities (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Given the low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or needs further decomposition."
