    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.stream.Streams",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and exposes a wide API surface: LOC = 384 and NOM = 21 (NOPM = 18 public methods) indicate substantial size and many responsibilities. The aggregate complexity is non-trivial (WMC = 21). While cohesion is moderate (LCOM = 0.4286), the combination of high LOC, many methods (especially many public methods), and non-trivial complexity suggests the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization (e.g., splitting responsibilities or extracting helper/strategy classes). The presence of an inner/related type (Streams.FailableStream) also indicates multiple concerns that could be separated."
