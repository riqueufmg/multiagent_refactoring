    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=39, nom=2, nopm=2 indicate minimal size; wmc=6 shows only moderate complexity; lcom=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). Metrics do not show excess size, complexity, or low cohesion that would justify further decomposition."
