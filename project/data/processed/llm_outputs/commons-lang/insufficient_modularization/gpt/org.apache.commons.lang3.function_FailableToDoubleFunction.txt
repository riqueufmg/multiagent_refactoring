    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=28, NOM=2, WMC=2, no fields (NOF=1 but NOPF=0), LCOM=-1.0 (indicating cohesion), DIT=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0, and no dependencies. Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence this single class requires further decomposition (no insufficient modularization)."
