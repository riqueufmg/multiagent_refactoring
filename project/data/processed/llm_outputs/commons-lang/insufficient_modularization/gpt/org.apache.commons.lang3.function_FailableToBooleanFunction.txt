    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=28, WMC=2, NOM=2, NOF=1. Cohesion indicator LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Low complexity and size together with zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies indicate there is no obvious need to further decompose this class; metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization."
