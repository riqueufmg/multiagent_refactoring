    "justification": "Class is small and already minimally decomposed: LOC=13, number of methods (nom)=1, weighted methods per class (wmc)=1, LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the single-method, low-complexity implementation, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
