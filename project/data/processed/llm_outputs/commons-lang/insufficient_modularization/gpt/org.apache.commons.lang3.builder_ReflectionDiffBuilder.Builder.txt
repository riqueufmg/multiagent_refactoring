    "justification": "Class is small and low complexity: LOC=39, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=2. Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. Given its small size, lack of methods, and low complexity/coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
