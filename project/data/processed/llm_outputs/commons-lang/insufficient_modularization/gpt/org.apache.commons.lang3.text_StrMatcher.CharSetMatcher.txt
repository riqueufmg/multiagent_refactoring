    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=27, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1. No incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a non-problematic cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0). These metrics indicate a simple, focused class rather than one that needs further decomposition, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
