    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=15, NOM=1, WMC=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0) and there are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given a single method, low complexity, and compact size, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
