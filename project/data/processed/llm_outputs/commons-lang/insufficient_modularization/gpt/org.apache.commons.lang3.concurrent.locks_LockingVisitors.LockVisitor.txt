    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks.LockingVisitors.LockVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a large size (loc = 215) while containing a relatively large number of fields (nof = 8) but no methods (nom = 0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc = 0). This combination indicates substantial implementation/data is concentrated in a single class and could be split into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity. Additional supporting metrics: lcom = -1.0 (cohesion metric present but not indicating clear decomposition), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no external interactions to justify monolithic grouping). Based on these elements taken in isolation, the class likely needs further decomposition."
