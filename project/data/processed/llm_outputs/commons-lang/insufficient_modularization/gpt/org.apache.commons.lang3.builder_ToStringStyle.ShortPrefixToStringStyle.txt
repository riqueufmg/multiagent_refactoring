    "justification": "The class is small and simple: loc=20, nom=0 (no methods), nof=1 (one field), wmc=0, nc=0 and dit=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies). LCOM=-1.0 reflects the absence of methods rather than a cohesion problem. Given the lack of methods, low size, zero complexity and zero coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
