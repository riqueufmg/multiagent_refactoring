    "justification": "Class analyzed in isolation does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc = 31), no fields (nof = 0) and no methods (nom = 0 / nopm = 0), very low complexity (wmc = 0), no inheritance depth (dit = 0), no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). LCOM = -1.0 (not indicative of cohesion issues). These metrics indicate the class is minimal and does not require further decomposition."
