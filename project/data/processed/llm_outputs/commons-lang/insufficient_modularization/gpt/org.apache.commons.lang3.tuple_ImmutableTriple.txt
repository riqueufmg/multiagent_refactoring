    "justification": "No smell: the class is small and cohesive. Key metrics: LOC=113 (moderate size), WMC=8 and NOM=8 (moderate complexity and method count), LCOM=0.25 (good cohesion), DIT=1 (shallow inheritance). There are no incoming/outgoing dependencies recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0) and the number of fields (NOF=6, NOPF=4) does not coincide with high complexity or poor cohesion. These values do not indicate that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
