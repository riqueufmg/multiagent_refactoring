    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=32, number of methods=3 (nom=3), weighted method count WMC=4 and only 1 field (nof=1, nopf=0). Although LCOM=1.0 indicates low sharing of fields between methods, the overall size and complexity are minimal, so further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or implementation complexity."
