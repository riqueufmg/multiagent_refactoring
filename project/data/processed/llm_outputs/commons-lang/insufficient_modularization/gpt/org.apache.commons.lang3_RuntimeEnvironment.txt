    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=53), low overall complexity (wmc=6), small number of methods (nom=5), and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Dependency and coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies count=2). Given these values, there is no evidence the class is overly large or multifaceted and it does not require further decomposition based on the provided data."
