    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.UncheckedFutureImpl",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=36), low method count (nom=3, nopm=2), low complexity (WMC=3), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), and low coupling/dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and well-factored, so further decomposition is not warranted."
