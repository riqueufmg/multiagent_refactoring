    "justification": "Class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 585), many methods (NOM = 45) including many public methods (NOPM = 42), high complexity (WMC = 71) and several fields (NOF = 13). The large public API surface and overall complexity indicate the class likely bundles multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity (even though LCOM = 0.0889 shows cohesion, the sheer method/count/complexity metrics justify decomposition)."
