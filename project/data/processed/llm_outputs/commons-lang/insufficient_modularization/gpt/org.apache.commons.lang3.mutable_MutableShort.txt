{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableShort",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class is large and complex for a simple mutable wrapper: nom (number of methods) = 31, loc = 274, and WMC (complexity) = 32 while holding only nof (number of fields) = 2. These metrics indicate many behaviors implemented on very little state, suggesting the class has multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. (DIT = 1, fanin = 0, fanout = 0, LCOM = 0.064516 indicate the class is shallow in the hierarchy and isolated, so the observed size/complexity is internal to this class rather than inherited or heavily connected.)"
