    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.BasicThreadFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: size (loc=227) is relatively large for a single class; number of fields nof=11 and number of methods nom=10 (with nopm=8 public) indicates a large public surface and many internal state elements; cyclomatic complexity wmc=14 is moderate-to-high, increasing implementation complexity. These combined metrics (high LOC, many fields and public methods, and non-trivial WMC) suggest the class may be handling multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity. Note: cohesion metric lcom=0.2 is low, but the raw counts of fields/methods and complexity still justify considering further decomposition. Dependency present: org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.BasicThreadFactory.Builder (builder-related logic may contribute to added responsibilities)."
