    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions.FailableBiFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal complexity: LOC=18, number of fields=0, number of methods=0, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0. No incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the absence of methods/fields and low complexity/coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or could be further decomposed."
