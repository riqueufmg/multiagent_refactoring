    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=14, number of methods (nom)=1, number of fields (nof)=1, WMC=1 (low complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its minimal size, single responsibility and low complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
