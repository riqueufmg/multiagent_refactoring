    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. It has a small number of methods (nom=7), modest size (loc=145) and low complexity (wmc=8). Cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.4286), indicating related responsibilities rather than a mix of unrelated features. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0) and dependencies are limited to an inner ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream and ObjectUtils. Given these metrics, there is no strong evidence that further decomposition would meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
