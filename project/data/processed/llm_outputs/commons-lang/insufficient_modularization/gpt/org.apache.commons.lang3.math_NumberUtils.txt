    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=1271); high implementation complexity (wmc=196); large number of methods (nom=68) with many public APIs (nopm=62); many fields (nof=21) indicating multiple state elements; moderate cohesion (lcom=0.4118) which suggests it groups multiple responsibilities rather than a single cohesive role; no inheritance decomposition (dit=0) and zero fan-in/fan-out, consistent with a monolithic utility class centralizing behavior. Together these metrics indicate the class is too large and complex and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
