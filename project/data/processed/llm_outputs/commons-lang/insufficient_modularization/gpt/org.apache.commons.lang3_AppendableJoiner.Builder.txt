    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.AppendableJoiner.Builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 69) while exposing no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0) and holding multiple fields (nof = 4). This combination suggests implementation code/behavior is concentrated (likely in constructors or inline blocks) rather than decomposed into smaller methods or helper classes. The presence of an external functional dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBiConsumer) indicates behavioral responsibilities that could be modularized. These elements (loc=69, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=4, dependency on FailableBiConsumer) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
