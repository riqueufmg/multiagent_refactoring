    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, simple class: LOC=16, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0 and no dependencies. Given the absence of implementation content and complexity, there is no evidence this class has not been decomposed further; it is too small to warrant further modularization."
