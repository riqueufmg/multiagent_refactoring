    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: LOC is small (12), no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), no public methods (nopm=0), and complexity is zero (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. The negative LCOM (-1.0) does not indicate a cohesion problem given the absence of members. These metrics show no evidence of a large or complex class that requires further decomposition."
