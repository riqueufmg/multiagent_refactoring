    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.IntegerRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=53), has low complexity (wmc=5), a small number of methods (nom=5, nopm=4), only one field (nof=1), high cohesion (lcom=1.0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
