    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 364) combined with high implementation complexity (wmc = 59) and many methods (nom = 21, nopm = 12) indicate multiple responsibilities packed into one class. It has no inheritance depth (dit = 0), so behavior is not distributed via subclassing, and it depends on several external utilities (org.apache.commons.lang3.Validate, FormatFactory, StrMatcher, LocaleUtils, StringUtils), suggesting it coordinates multiple concerns. Cohesion is not maximal (lcom = 0.333...), i.e. only moderate cohesion. Taken together (high LOC + high WMC + many methods + moderate cohesion + multiple external dependencies) this class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
