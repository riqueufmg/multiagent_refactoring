    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: only 2 methods (nom=2), 30 lines of code (loc=30), low complexity (wmc=2) and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). It has no fan-in or fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
