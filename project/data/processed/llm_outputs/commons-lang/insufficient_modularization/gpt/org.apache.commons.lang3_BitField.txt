    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: the class is moderate in size (loc=161) with 18 methods (nom=18) and a moderate complexity (wmc=18). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), there are only 2 fields (nof=2), no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate an oversized, low-cohesion, or overly complex class that would clearly benefit from further decomposition."
