    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.CharSequenceTranslator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: moderate implementation size (loc = 91) combined with relatively high method complexity (wmc = 13) spread across a small set of methods (nom = 6) suggests complex, non-trivial behavior within the class. Cohesion is low (lcom = 0.6666666666666666), indicating the methods are not tightly related and the class likely embodies multiple responsibilities that could be separated. The single field (nof = 1) and zero fan-in/fan-out do not contradict the need for decomposition. Taken in isolation, these metrics justify refactoring the class into smaller, more cohesive components."
