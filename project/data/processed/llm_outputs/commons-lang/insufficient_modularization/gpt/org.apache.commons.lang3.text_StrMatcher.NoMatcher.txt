    "justification": "Class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=21), no fields or methods (nof=0, nom=0), zero measured complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), no external dependencies, and shallow inheritance (dit=1). These elements indicate the class is already minimal and not in need of further decomposition."
