    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableInt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization because it is large and behavior-rich despite representing a small data holder: nom (number of methods) = 30 and nopm (public methods) = 30 indicate a very large public API; loc (lines of code) = 267 shows substantial size; wmc (complexity) = 31 indicates high implementation complexity. These are high relative to nof (number of fields) = 2, i.e. few data fields but many methods/operations, suggesting the class mixes multiple behaviors rather than being a minimal value object. Although lcom = 0.0667 indicates methods are cohesive, the combination of high method count, large LOC, and elevated WMC supports decomposing the class into smaller, more focused modules to reduce size and complexity."
