    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of Insufficient Modularization: extremely large size (loc = 5740), very high number of methods (nom = 377, nopm = 367), and very high complexity (wmc = 870). It also has many fields (nof = 25, nopf = 25) and only moderate/low cohesion (lcom = 0.403). The combination of high method count, high complexity, many fields, and limited cohesion indicates multiple responsibilities and suggests the class can be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive modules. The variety of listed dependencies (ClassUtils, BooleanUtils, CharUtils, ObjectUtils, etc.) supports the likelihood of multiple concerns being handled in this single class."
