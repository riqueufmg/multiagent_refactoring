    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: loc=26, nom=2, wmc=2. It has minimal state (nof=1) and no reported coupling to other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0). Cohesion metric shows no indication of poor cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Given the low size, low complexity, few methods, and lack of external dependencies, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
