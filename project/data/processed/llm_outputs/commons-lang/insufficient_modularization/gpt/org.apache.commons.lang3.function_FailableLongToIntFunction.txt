    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=26, nom=2, wmc=2. Low coupling and external usage: fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]. Single field (nof=1) and no inheritance (dit=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion. These metrics show no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
