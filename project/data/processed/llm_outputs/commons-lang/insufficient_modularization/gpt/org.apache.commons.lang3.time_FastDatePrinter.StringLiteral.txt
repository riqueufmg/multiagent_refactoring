    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=25, nom=0 (no methods), nof=1 (one field), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0, fanout=0, and no dependencies. In isolation there is no evidence the class is overly large or complex and therefore no insufficient modularization smell is detected."
