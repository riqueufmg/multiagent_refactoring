    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharEncoding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc = 55), very few methods (nom = 2) and low overall complexity (wmc = 3) indicate limited behavior to decompose further. It is isolated (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and has modest state (nof = 6). These metrics suggest the class is compact and focused, so further decomposition is not warranted."
