    "justification": "Class shows no signs of Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=14), minimal complexity (wmc=1), only one method (nom=1) and one field (nof=1), perfect cohesion (lcom=0.0), zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (dit=0). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and does not require further decomposition."
