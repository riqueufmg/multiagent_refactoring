    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrBuilder.StrBuilderWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No evidence of insufficient modularization: class size is small (loc=50), there are no methods reported (nom=0) and no complexity (wmc=0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and there are no dependencies, so there is no indication the class is large or complex enough to require decomposition. LCOM is not informative (−1.0) but with no methods cohesion concerns cannot be established."
