    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition when considered in isolation: LOC=211 (moderate size), WMC=18 (moderate complexity), NOF=8 and NOM=12 (manageable number of fields and methods), NOPM=5 (small public API), and LCOM=0.1667 (low cohesion metric value indicates good internal cohesion). Fan-in/fan-out are 0 and dependency list is small. These values suggest the class is reasonably cohesive and not excessively large or complex, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
