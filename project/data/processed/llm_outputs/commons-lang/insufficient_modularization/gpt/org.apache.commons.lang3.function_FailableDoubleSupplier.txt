    "justification": "The class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=13, number of methods=1 (nom=1), WMC=1 indicating minimal complexity, fanin=0 and fanout=0 showing no coupling to decompose, and LCOM=-1.0 indicating high cohesion. Given its minimal size and complexity and absence of dependencies, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
