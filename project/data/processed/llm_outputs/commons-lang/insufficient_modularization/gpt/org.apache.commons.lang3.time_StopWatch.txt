    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a decomposition candidate based on its internal size and complexity: LOC = 549, NOM = 38 (NOPM = 36) and WMC = 56 indicate a large number of methods and high overall complexity; NOF = 9 combined with many public methods (NOPM nearly equal to NOM) implies a large public API surface that can be split into smaller responsibilities; DIT = 0 and NC = 0 show no use of inheritance to distribute behavior, and FANIN/FANOUT = 0 suggests the class is self-contained/monolithic rather than modularized; listed dependencies include StopWatch.State and StopWatch.SplitState, indicating internal state and split-management responsibilities that could be separated (state handling, split logic, formatting/utility behavior). While LCOM is low (0.0789) suggesting cohesion, the absolute size and complexity metrics (LOC, NOM, WMC) still justify further decomposition to reduce class size and implementation complexity."
