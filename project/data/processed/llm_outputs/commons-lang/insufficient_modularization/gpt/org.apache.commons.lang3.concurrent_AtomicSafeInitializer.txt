    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LCOM=0.714 (poor cohesion) combined with LOC=95 and WMC=9 (moderate size/complexity) and NOM=7 with NOF=3 indicates multiple methods/behaviors operating on a small set of fields. Presence of an inner Builder and dependencies on FailableSupplier/FailableConsumer and ConcurrentException suggests the class encapsulates multiple responsibilities. DIT=3 adds inheritance-related complexity. These elements together indicate the class is not sufficiently decomposed and could benefit from further modularization."
