    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits hallmark signs of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 4411), a very high number of methods (nom = 244) with a large public API surface (nopm = 235), and extremely high complexity (wmc = 713). It has relatively few fields (nof = 10, nopf = 5) compared with the number of methods, indicating many independent behaviors implemented as methods rather than being grouped into smaller cohesive units. Cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.4057), which together with the massive method count and complexity suggests multiple responsibilities that could be split. These metrics, taken in isolation, justify that the class has not been completely decomposed and would benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
