    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=41, NOM=3, WMC=3 indicating low implementation complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
