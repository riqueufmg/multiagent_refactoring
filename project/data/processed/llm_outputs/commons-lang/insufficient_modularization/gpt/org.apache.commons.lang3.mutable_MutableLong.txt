{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableLong",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a relatively high method count (nom = 30), LOC = 267 and cyclomatic-weighted metric (wmc = 31), the cohesion is high (lcom = 0.0667) and there are only two fields (nof = 2). Depth of inheritance is shallow (dit = 1) and there are no reported incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These indicators show the class implements a single, cohesive responsibility (a mutable long wrapper) rather than multiple unrelated responsibilities, so there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
