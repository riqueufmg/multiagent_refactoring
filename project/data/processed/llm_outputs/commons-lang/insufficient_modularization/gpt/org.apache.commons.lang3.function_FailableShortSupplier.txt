    "justification": "The class is very small and already minimal: LOC=13, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. With a single method, no fields, and low complexity there is no evidence it needs further decomposition; cohesion metrics do not indicate modularization issues (LCOM=-1.0, likely not applicable). Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
