    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed/overlarge class: LOC is small (23), WMC = 0 and NOM = 0 (no internal method complexity), fan-in = 0 and fan-out = 0 (no coupling pressure), only 2 external dependencies, and LCOM = -1.0 (no sign of fragmented responsibilities). Although there are 4 fields, the absence of methods and the low size/complexity metrics indicate the class is not suffering from insufficient modularization."
