    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=7, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods or fields to decompose (NOM and NOF are zero) and overall complexity is minimal (WMC=0). Given the minimal size and lack of implementation content, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
