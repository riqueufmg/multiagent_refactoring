    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is moderate (74) but there are 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 weighted method complexity (wmc=0), only 1 field (nof=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and LCOM=-1.0 indicating cohesion. In isolation there is no evidence the class is overly large or complex and therefore no decomposition is justified."
