    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=94 (moderate size), NOF=3 (few fields), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods and no measured complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (cohesion indicator favorable), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling/dependencies). In isolation these values do not show a large, complex, low-cohesion class that would benefit from further decomposition."
