    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=16, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method count (wmc)=0, number of fields (nof)=3. Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Depth of inheritance (dit=2) is not by itself a sign of insufficient modularization. Given the low size, zero method complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
