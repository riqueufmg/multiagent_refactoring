    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=95, WMC=6, NOM=6 (NOPM=5). Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5) and there are no public fields (NOPF=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single external dependency: org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils). These metrics do not indicate a large, complex class that should be further decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
