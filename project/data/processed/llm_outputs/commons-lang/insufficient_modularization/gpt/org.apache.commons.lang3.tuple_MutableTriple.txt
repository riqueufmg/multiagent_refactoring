    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple.MutableTriple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. LOC=124 and WMC=11 indicate modest size and complexity; LCOM=0.2727272727272727 shows good cohesion (members are related); nof=5 fields (expected for a triple) and nom=11 (all public accessors/mutators) align with a single responsibility (holding three values) rather than multiple unrelated responsibilities. dit=1 and fanin/fanout=0 indicate low coupling. Given these metrics, there is no strong evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
