    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 1110), high implementation complexity (wmc = 245), large number of methods (nom = 43, nopm = 43) and a substantial number of fields (nof = 16). Cohesion is not high (lcom = 0.674), suggesting related responsibilities are spread across many methods. Consider decomposing this class to reduce size and per-class complexity."
