    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undivided, overly-large or highly complex class: LOC=129 (moderate size), NOM=6 and NOPM=2 (few methods), WMC=8 (low-to-moderate complexity), NOF=4 (few fields), LCOM=0.333 (good cohesion). Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 indicate no excessive coupling in the provided context. Given the small number of methods, low complexity and acceptable cohesion, there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
