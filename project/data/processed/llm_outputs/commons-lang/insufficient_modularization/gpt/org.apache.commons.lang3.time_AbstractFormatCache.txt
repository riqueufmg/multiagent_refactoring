    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.AbstractFormatCache",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Size and complexity indicators show the class is a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 166 and NOM = 10 (many methods), WMC = 12 (moderate internal complexity). Cohesion is not high (LCOM = 0.4), suggesting multiple responsibilities. There are only 2 public methods (NOPM = 2) but 10 total methods, indicating substantial internal implementation detail that could be split out. The class has 5 fields (NOF = 5) and depends on multiple concerns (TimeZones, LocaleUtils, and an inner ArrayKey), which also suggests mixed responsibilities (caching, locale/time handling, key management). These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
