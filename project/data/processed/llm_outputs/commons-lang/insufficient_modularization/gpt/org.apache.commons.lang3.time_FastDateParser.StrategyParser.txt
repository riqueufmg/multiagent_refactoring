    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: loc=51 (small class size), nom=0 (no methods to further decompose), nof=2 (only two fields), wmc=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion data but no methods present), fanin=0 and fanout=0 with dependencies=[] (no coupling). Considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
