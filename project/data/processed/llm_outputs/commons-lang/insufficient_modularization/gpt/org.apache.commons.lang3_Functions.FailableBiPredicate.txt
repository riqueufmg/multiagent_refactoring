    "justification": "Class shows no signs of excessive size or complexity: LOC=17 (small), nom=0 and nof=0 (no methods/fields to decompose), wmc=0 (no method complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), and no dependencies. Given these metrics the class appears minimal and does not warrant further decomposition."
