    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, simple class: loc=23, nom=0 (no methods), nof=1 (single field), wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There is only a single external dependency (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils). Given the lack of methods, low LOC, minimal fields and zero complexity/interaction, there is no evidence the class contains multiple responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition."
