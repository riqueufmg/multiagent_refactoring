    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=165 (moderate size), WMC=17 (moderate complexity), NOM=12 with NOPM=5 (method count reasonable), NOF=4 (few fields), LCOM=0.25 (good cohesion), DIT=1 (shallow inheritance), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (low coupling). Given the class-level cohesion and moderate size/complexity, there is no strong evidence that the class has not been decomposed and requires further modularization."
