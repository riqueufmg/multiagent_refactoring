    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 584) and high implementation complexity (wmc = 48) combined with a large number of methods (nom = 36) of which almost all are public (nopm = 35), indicating a broad responsibility surface that could be split. The deep API surface (35 public methods) suggests multiple responsibilities that would benefit from decomposition. The class depends on multiple utility classes (org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils, ClassUtils, MemberUtils, JavaVersion, StringUtils, SystemUtils), implying varied functionality. Metrics such as dit = 0 and nc = 0 indicate it stands alone rather than being decomposed into subclasses or collaborators within the analyzed scope. Taken together (high LOC, high WMC, many public methods, diverse dependencies), these elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
