    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastTimeZone",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class does not show signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=55), small number of fields (nof=2) and methods (nom=6), moderate complexity (wmc=10) and low lack-of-cohesion (lcom=0.3333) — indicating reasonable cohesion. It has no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a small public API (nopm=3). These metrics suggest the class is compact and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
