    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.AbstractSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: small size (LOC=21), very few methods (NOM=2, NOPM=1), and low implementation complexity (WMC=2). Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although it has inheritance metrics (DIT=1, NC=3), the class itself is small and simple, so further decomposition is not indicated."
