    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=28), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal state (nof=1), zero complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion issues given the lack of methods. These metrics do not justify further decomposition."
