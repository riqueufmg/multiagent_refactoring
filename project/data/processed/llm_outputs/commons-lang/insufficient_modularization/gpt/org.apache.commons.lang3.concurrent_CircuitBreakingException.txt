    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=37, NOM=4, WMC=4 and only 1 field (NOF=1). Coupling indicators show no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). Although LCOM=1.0 indicates low cohesion, the overall size and low complexity do not support further decomposition; metrics do not exhibit the large size or high complexity characteristic of Insufficient Modularization."
