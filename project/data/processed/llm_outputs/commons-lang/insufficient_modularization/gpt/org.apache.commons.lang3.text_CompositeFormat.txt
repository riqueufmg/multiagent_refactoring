    "justification": "Class has small size and low complexity (loc=72, wmc=6), a small number of methods and public methods (nom=6, nopm=6), only 3 fields (nof=3), and moderate-to-good cohesion (lcom=0.333). No coupling or inheritance concerns are indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=0). These metrics do not indicate that the class is insufficiently modularized or that it needs further decomposition."
