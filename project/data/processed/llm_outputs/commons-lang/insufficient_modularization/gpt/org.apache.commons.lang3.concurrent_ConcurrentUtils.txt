    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 202) combined with a non-trivial number of methods (nom = 12, nopm = 10) which suggests many responsibilities exposed as public methods; high implementation complexity (wmc = 19) that could be reduced by decomposition; only moderate cohesion (lcom = 0.5) implying the methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility; and no structural decomposition via nesting or inheritance (nc = 0, dit = 0). Additionally, the class interacts with multiple distinct dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentException, ConcurrentRuntimeException, ConcurrentInitializer, org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ExceptionUtils), consistent with handling several concerns. Together these elements justify marking this class as a candidate for further decomposition."
