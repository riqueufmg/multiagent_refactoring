    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being undersized-modularized: high method count (nom = 29) with many public methods (nopm = 25), large size (loc = 314) and non-trivial complexity (wmc = 34). Although cohesion appears acceptable (lcom = 0.172), the combination of many public operations and overall size/complexity indicates the class likely groups multiple responsibilities that could be split into smaller, focused modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
