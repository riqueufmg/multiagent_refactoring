    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=31, number of fields=2, number of methods=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There is no evidence of high implementation size or complexity that would motivate further decomposition; the low LOC, zero methods and zero complexity measures justify that Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
