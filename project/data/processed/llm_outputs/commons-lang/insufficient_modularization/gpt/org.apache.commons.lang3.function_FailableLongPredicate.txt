    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=65), modest number of methods (nom=6) and low complexity (wmc=6); only 2 fields; high cohesion (lcom=-1.0); no incoming/outgoing coupling shown (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies listed. These elements suggest the class is small, cohesive, and not a candidate for further decomposition in isolation."
