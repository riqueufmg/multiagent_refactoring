    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=46, NOM=3, WMC=3. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and there are no dependencies. Given low size and low complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed or that further decomposition is required."
