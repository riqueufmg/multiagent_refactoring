    "justification": "Class is small and simple, so insufficient modularization is not detected. Metrics: loc=26, nom=2, wmc=2 indicate low size and complexity; lcom=-1.0 indicates high cohesion; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling/dependencies; nc=0 and dit=0 show no inheritance complexity. Given these values and analyzing the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it should be further decomposed."
