    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC = 126 (small/medium size), NOM = 14 with NOPM = 14 (methods count is moderate), WMC = 15 (borderline complexity but not extreme), LCOM = 0.142857 (low cohesion value meaning high internal cohesion), NOF = 2 (few fields), DIT = 1 (shallow hierarchy), FANIN/FANOUT = 0 and only two dependencies. High cohesion and modest size/complexity imply the class is not a clear candidate for further decomposition."
