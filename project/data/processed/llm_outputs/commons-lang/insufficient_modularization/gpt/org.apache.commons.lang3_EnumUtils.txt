    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.EnumUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a large size (loc=322) and high implementation complexity (wmc=30) combined with many operations (nom=23) and many public methods (nopm=20), which indicate multiple responsibilities and a broad public API that could be split. Cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.4348) rather than high, suggesting related functionality is not tightly focused. It also contains multiple fields (nof=4) while having no inheritance or nested decomposition (dit=0, nc=0), supporting the case that further decomposition into smaller classes/modules would likely reduce size and complexity."
