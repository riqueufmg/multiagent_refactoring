    "justification": "The class is small and already well-modularized: LOC=27, NOM=2, WMC=4 indicate low size and complexity; LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion; only 1 field (NOF=1) and DIT=1 suggest simple structure; fanin=0 and fanout=0 and a single dependency imply low coupling. These metrics do not support further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
