    "justification": "Metrics show the class is tiny and trivial: LOC=12, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and no dependencies. There are no methods or fields to decompose and no complexity or coupling that would benefit from further modularization, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
