    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC=37 (small), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods / no complexity), NOF=1 (single field), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling), LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion data indicating issues). Given the small size, lack of methods/behavior, and low coupling, there is no evidence that this class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
