{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.math.IEEE754rUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13, nopm=13) and 180 lines of code (loc=180) with a weighted methods complexity of 25 (wmc=25). These values indicate substantial size and implementation complexity concentrated in a single class; the high number of public methods (nopm=13) suggests many exposed responsibilities. Taken in isolation, these metrics justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
