    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, simple class that does not show signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 22, number of methods (nom) = 0, WMC = 0, number of fields (nof) = 1, fanin = 0, fanout = 0, DIT = 1. There are no methods or significant complexity that would benefit from further decomposition, so there is no evidence this class has not been sufficiently modularized."
