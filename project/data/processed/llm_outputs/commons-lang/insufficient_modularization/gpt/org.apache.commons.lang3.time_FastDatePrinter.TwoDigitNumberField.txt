    "justification": "Insufficient modularization not detected: class is small (loc=36), has minimal state (nof=1) and no methods reported (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and LCOM=-1.0 indicating high cohesion. Metrics show no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
