    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=141 and NOM=12 show a moderate size and method count, WMC=13 indicates only moderate complexity, LCOM=0.4167 (well below 1) indicates reasonable cohesion, NOF=4 (NOPF=3) is small, DIT=1 minimal inheritance, and FANIN/FANOUT=0 show no coupling concerns in the provided data. Together these values suggest the class is sufficiently decomposed and does not require further modularization in isolation."
