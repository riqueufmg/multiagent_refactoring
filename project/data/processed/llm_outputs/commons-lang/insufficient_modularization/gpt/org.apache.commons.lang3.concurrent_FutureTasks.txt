    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=19, NOM=2, WMC=2. Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0) and there are no external couplings (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size, low complexity, few methods, and high cohesion, there is no indication that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
