    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: loc=68 (small size), nom=6 and wmc=6 (moderate number of methods and low complexity), nof=2 (few fields), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no external coupling). These values suggest the class is small, cohesive, and not a candidate for further decomposition."
