    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=39, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, DIT=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. There are no methods or internal complexity indicating multiple responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition. Metrics show low size and coupling, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
