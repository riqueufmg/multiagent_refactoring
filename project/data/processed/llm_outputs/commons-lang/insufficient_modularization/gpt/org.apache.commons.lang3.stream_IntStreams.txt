    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=37, WMC=4, NOM=4, NOF=0. Cohesion metric indicates high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). No incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). These metrics show low size and complexity, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition (no insufficient modularization)."
