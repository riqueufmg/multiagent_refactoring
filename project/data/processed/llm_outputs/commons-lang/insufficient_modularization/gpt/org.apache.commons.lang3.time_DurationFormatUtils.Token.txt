    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationFormatUtils.Token",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 92 (relatively large for a single class) while NOM = 0 (no methods), NOF = 4 (fields) and WMC = 0. A substantial size (92 LOC) combined with no methods suggests the class contains non-decomposed logic or multiple responsibilities expressed without modular behavior. LCOM = -1.0 and fanin/fanout = 0 further indicate low method cohesion and isolation. These elements together justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
