    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableInt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=31, LOC=267, LCOM=0.067), minimal fields (nof=2), and no dependencies. It shows high cohesion and single responsibility as a mutable wrapper for a primitive int."
