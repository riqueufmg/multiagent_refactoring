    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high metrics: LOC (549) and WMC (56) indicate significant size and complexity. It has 38 methods (nom) and 9 fields (nof), suggesting multiple responsibilities. The low LCOM (0.079) suggests high cohesion, but the overall size and method count imply insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
