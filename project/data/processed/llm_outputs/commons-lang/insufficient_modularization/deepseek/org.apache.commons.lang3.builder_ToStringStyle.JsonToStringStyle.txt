    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringStyle.JsonToStringStyle",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields, 0 methods, 0 public members, 169 LOC, and 0 dependencies. While LOC is moderately high, the lack of methods and complexity (WMC=0, NC=0) suggests it's primarily a data/configuration class rather than one with implementation complexity requiring decomposition."
