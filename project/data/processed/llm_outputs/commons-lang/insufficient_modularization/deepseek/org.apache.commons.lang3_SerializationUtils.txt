    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.SerializationUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 public methods (nom=7, nopm=7) and 145 lines of code (loc=145), indicating significant implementation complexity concentrated in a single class. The LCOM value of 0.43 suggests moderate cohesion, and the presence of an inner class (ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream) as a dependency hints at functionality that could be further decomposed into separate classes to reduce size and complexity."
