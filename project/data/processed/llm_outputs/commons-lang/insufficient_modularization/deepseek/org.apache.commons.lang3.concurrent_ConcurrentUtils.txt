    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom) and 202 lines of code (loc), indicating a large size and potential for further decomposition to reduce complexity. The weighted method count (wmc) of 19 suggests moderate complexity, and the lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate it operates in isolation, making it a candidate for splitting into smaller, more focused modules."
