    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.LazyInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=8, LOC=84, NOM=6) with high cohesion (LCOM=0.83) and minimal dependencies. It already delegates initialization logic to a Builder class, showing appropriate decomposition. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
