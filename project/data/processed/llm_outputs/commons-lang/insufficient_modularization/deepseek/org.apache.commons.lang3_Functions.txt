    "justification": "The class has 25 methods (nom) and 421 lines of code (loc), indicating high size and potential complexity. It contains 10 inner class dependencies, suggesting it aggregates multiple functional interfaces that could be decomposed into separate, more focused classes to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
