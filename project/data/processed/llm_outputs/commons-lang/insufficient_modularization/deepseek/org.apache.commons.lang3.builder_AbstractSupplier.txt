    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.AbstractSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: only 2 methods (1 public), 21 lines of code, and 2 weighted methods. It has no fields and minimal dependencies. These characteristics indicate the class is already appropriately modularized with no evidence of needing further decomposition."
