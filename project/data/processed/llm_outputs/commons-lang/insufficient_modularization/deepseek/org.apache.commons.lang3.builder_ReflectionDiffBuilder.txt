    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionDiffBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 12 methods (nom=12) with 5 public methods (nopm=5) and 165 lines of code (loc=165), indicating substantial size and complexity. The presence of an inner class 'Builder' in dependencies suggests incomplete decomposition, as inner class functionality could potentially be separated. High method count and lines of code exceed typical modular class thresholds."
