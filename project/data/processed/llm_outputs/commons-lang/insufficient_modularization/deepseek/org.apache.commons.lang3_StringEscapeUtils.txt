{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: 17 methods (nom=17), 291 lines of code (loc=291), and 24 fields (nof=24). All 17 methods are public (nopm=17), indicating the class handles multiple responsibilities. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and high lack of cohesion (lcom=1.0) suggest insufficient decomposition of functionality into smaller, more cohesive units."
