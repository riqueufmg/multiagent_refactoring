{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.DiffBuilder.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 0 methods with 69 lines of code, indicating minimal implementation complexity. No methods exist to decompose, and the single dependency is external. The negative LCOM suggests high cohesion, and the class appears to be a simple builder pattern implementation."
