    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 37 lines of code (loc=37), which is small in size. All methods are public (nopm=4), indicating a focused, utility-style interface. Low complexity (wmc=4) and no dependencies suggest minimal implementation complexity. No evidence of further decomposition being beneficial."
