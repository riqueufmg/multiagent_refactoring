    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (119 LOC, 11 methods) with low complexity (WMC=12, LCOM=0.27) and minimal dependencies. It already uses decomposition through an inner State class, and the metrics do not indicate excessive implementation complexity requiring further modularization."
