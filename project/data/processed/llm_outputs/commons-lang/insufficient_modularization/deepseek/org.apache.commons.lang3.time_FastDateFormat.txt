    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateFormat",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high complexity (WMC=44, LOC=422, NOM=43) and low cohesion (LCOM=0.093), indicating multiple responsibilities that could be separated. It has 8 fields and depends on multiple complex classes (FastDatePrinter, FastDateParser), suggesting it aggregates functionality that could be further decomposed."
