    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ClassPathUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 public methods and 80 lines of code, which is relatively small. It has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely a utility class with static methods. The lack of dependencies suggests it is self-contained. The size and complexity do not indicate a need for further decomposition."
