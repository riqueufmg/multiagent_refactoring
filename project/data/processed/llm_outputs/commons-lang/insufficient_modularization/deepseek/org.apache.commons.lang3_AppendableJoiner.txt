{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.AppendableJoiner",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 12 methods (nom=12) and 211 lines of code (loc=211), indicating substantial size and potential complexity. The weighted method complexity (wmc=18) suggests moderate method complexity. The presence of 8 fields (nof=8) and dependencies on multiple external classes indicates multiple responsibilities. These metrics collectively suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
