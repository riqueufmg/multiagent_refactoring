    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field, 2 methods, 26 lines of code, and 2 weighted methods complexity, indicating minimal size and complexity. No dependencies suggest it is already a focused, single-responsibility unit. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
