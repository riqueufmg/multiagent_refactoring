    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateFormatUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high method count (nom=18, nopm=17), high field count (nof=15, nopf=14), and high lines of code (loc=251). The lack of inheritance (dit=0, nc=0) and absence of external dependencies beyond FastDateFormat suggest all functionality is concentrated in this single class. High LCOM (0.61) indicates low method cohesion, further suggesting insufficient decomposition."
