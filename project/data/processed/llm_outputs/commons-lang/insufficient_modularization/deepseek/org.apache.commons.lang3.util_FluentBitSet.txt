    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.util.FluentBitSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 44 methods (nom=44) and 396 lines of code (loc=396), indicating high implementation complexity and size that could be reduced through further decomposition. The low LCOM value (0.068) suggests high method cohesion, but the large number of methods and lines of code exceeds typical modularization thresholds."
