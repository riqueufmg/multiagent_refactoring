    "justification": "Class has high method count (nom=37, nopm=35), high lines of code (loc=467), and high weighted method complexity (wmc=45), indicating it is large and complex. It also has many dependencies (18), suggesting it aggregates multiple responsibilities. These factors suggest further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
