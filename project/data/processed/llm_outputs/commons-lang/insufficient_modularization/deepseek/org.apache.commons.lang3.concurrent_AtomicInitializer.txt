    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods with 4 public methods, 2 fields, and moderate complexity (WMC=9, LCOM=0.71). The presence of an inner Builder class and dependencies on FailableSupplier, FailableConsumer, and ConcurrentException suggests multiple responsibilities related to initialization, configuration, and exception handling that could be further decomposed."
