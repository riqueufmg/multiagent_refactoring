    "justification": "Class has low complexity metrics (WMC=5, LOC=56, NOM=5) with no fields (NOF=1 is likely a static constant), no dependencies, and high cohesion (LCOM=-1 indicates no instance variables to measure cohesion against). Further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
