    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=10, LOC=101, NOM=9) and no indication of high implementation complexity or excessive responsibilities that would require further decomposition. It has a single public field (NOPF=1) and appropriate public methods (NOPM=8). The dependencies are minimal and focused on related builder functionality."
