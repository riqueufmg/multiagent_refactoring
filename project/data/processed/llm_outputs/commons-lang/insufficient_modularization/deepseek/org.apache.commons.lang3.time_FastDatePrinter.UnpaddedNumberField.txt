    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), and 39 lines of code (loc=39), which indicates minimal size and complexity. No dependencies suggest it is already a focused, single-responsibility unit. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
