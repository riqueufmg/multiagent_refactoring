    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Streams",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 4 methods and 198 lines of code, indicating high implementation complexity and size. The LCOM value of 0.75 suggests low method cohesion, and the presence of an inner class (Streams.FailableStream) shows partial decomposition that could be extended to further reduce complexity."
