{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.ConstructorUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods with 8 being public, 185 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 17. This indicates a high method count and implementation complexity concentrated in a single class that could be reduced through further decomposition into more focused helper classes."
