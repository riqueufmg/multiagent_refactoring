    "justification": "Class has 6 fields (nof=6) and only 2 methods (nom=2), resulting in a high LCOM value of 1.0 indicating low cohesion. The class size (loc=55) and complexity (wmc=3) are low, but the field-to-method ratio suggests insufficient decomposition where fields may not be properly encapsulated with behavior."
