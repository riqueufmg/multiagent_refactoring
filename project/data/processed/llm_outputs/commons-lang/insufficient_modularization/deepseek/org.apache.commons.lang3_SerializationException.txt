    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.SerializationException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 4 public methods, 38 lines of code, and a weighted method count of 4. It has no fields, no dependencies, and serves a single, cohesive purpose as a custom exception type. Further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
