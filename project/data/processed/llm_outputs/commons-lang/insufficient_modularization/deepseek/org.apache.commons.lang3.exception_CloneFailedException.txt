    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods, 29 lines of code, and 0 dependencies. Its size and complexity are minimal, and it already serves a single, well-defined purpose as a specific exception type. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
