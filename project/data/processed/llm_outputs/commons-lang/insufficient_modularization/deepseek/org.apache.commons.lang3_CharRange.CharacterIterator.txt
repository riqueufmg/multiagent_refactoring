{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharRange.CharacterIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields and 0 methods, with 89 LOC suggesting it's primarily a data structure or simple iterator. No methods exist to decompose, and dependencies are minimal (only its enclosing class). The negative LCOM indicates high cohesion, and low WMC/NC suggest minimal complexity."
