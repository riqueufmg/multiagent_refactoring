    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayFill",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (10 public) with 146 lines of code and a weighted method complexity of 22, indicating significant implementation complexity concentrated in a single class. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) suggests it is a utility class with procedural code that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and complexity."
