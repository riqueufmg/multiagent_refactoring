    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) with 8 public methods (nopm=8), 235 lines of code (loc=235), and a weighted method complexity of 21 (wmc=21). These metrics indicate a large and complex class that could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
