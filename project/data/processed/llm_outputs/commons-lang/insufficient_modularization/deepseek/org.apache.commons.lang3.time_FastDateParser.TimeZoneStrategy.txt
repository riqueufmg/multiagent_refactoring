    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.TimeZoneStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 fields (nof=7) and 109 lines of code (loc=109), indicating significant size and potential complexity. With no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and negative LCOM (-1.0), the fields are not being utilized by methods within the class, suggesting insufficient decomposition where responsibilities could be better modularized."
