    "justification": "Class has high complexity metrics: LOC (1363) and WMC (236) are very high, indicating large size and many decision points. It has many methods (59) and fields (12), suggesting multiple responsibilities. Low LCOM (0.22) indicates high cohesion, but the sheer size and complexity imply insufficient decomposition into smaller, focused modules."
