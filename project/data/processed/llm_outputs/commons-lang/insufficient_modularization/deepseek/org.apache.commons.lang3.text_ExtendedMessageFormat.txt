    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (364) and WMC (59) are substantial, and it has 21 methods with only 12 being public, indicating potential internal helper methods that could be extracted. The LCOM value (0.333) suggests moderate cohesion, meaning responsibilities may be grouped that could be separated into smaller modules."
