    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (584) and WMC (48) are high, and it contains a large number of methods (NOM=36, NOPM=35). This indicates the class is large and complex, suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
