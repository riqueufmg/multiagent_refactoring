    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.BasicThreadFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 11 fields (nof=11) and 10 methods (nom=10) with 227 lines of code (loc=227), indicating substantial size and complexity. The low LCOM (0.2) suggests high cohesion, but the presence of a nested Builder class dependency suggests the main class could be further decomposed to separate concerns and reduce implementation complexity."
