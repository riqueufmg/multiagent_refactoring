    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharSetUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 9 methods with 6 public methods, 151 LOC, and WMC of 26, indicating high implementation complexity and size that could be reduced through further decomposition. The negative LCOM value suggests high method coupling, and the class performs multiple string operations that could be separated into distinct responsibilities."
