    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.compare.ComparableUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) with 171 lines of code (loc=171) and a weighted method complexity of 10 (wmc=10), indicating moderate size and complexity. The presence of an inner class dependency suggests some decomposition exists, but the class could potentially be further decomposed to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
