    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableLong",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 30 methods (nom=30) and 267 lines of code (loc=267), indicating high implementation complexity and size that could be reduced through further decomposition. The low LCOM value (0.067) suggests high method cohesion, but the large number of methods and lines of code still exceeds typical modularization thresholds."
