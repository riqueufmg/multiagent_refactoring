    "justification": "High WMC (63) and LOC (271) indicate significant complexity. The class has 9 methods with only 3 public methods, suggesting internal helper methods that could be extracted. LCOM of 0.67 shows moderate cohesion, meaning methods may not be strongly related and could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
