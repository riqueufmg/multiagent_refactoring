    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18) with a high WMC (18) and LOC (161), indicating significant implementation complexity concentrated in a single class. All methods are public (nom=nopm=18), suggesting the class handles multiple responsibilities without decomposition into smaller, more focused units."
