    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom) and 170 lines of code (loc), indicating a large, monolithic structure. The weighted method complexity (wmc) of 25 suggests moderate to high implementation complexity. The lack of decomposition is evident as it has no children (nc=0) and no parent (dit=0), and it depends on multiple utility classes, suggesting it aggregates multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
