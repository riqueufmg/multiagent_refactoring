    "justification": "Class has 15 methods with only 3 public methods, indicating many private/internal methods that could be grouped into separate helper classes. Low LCOM (0.2) suggests high cohesion, but 91 LOC and 16 WMC show moderate complexity that could benefit from decomposition of internal logic."
