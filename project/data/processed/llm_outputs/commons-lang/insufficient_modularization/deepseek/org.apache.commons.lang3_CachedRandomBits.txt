    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 1 public method (nopm=1), 7 fields (nof=7), low complexity (wmc=6), and small size (loc=67). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates high cohesion, and there are no dependencies suggesting missing abstractions. The current modularization appears sufficient for its responsibilities."
