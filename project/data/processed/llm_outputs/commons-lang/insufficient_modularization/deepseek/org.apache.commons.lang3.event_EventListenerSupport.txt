    "justification": "Class has 15 methods (nom=15) with 8 public methods (nopm=8) and 219 lines of code (loc=219), indicating substantial size and complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. The weighted method complexity (wmc=17) and lack of inheritance (dit=0) suggest all functionality is concentrated in this single class."
