```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrMatcher.TrimMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 21 lines of code (loc=21). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and Depth of Inheritance Tree is 1 (dit=1), indicating minimal inheritance. While the class is nested (indicated by the name StrMatcher.TrimMatcher), its extremely small size and low complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, well-contained component."
