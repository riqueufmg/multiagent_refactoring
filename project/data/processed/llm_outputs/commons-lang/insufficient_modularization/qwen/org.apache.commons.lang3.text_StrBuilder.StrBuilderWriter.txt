{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrBuilder.StrBuilderWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0, wmc=0) and only 50 lines of code (loc=50). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, lightweight component with no signs of insufficient modularization."
