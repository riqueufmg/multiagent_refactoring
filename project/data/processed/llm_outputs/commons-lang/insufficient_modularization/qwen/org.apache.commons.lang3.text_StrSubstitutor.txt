{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrSubstitutor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 55 total methods (nom), 51 public methods (nopm), 782 lines of code (loc), and weighted method count of 98 (wmc). The high number of methods and lines of code suggests the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further breakdown into smaller, more focused classes."
