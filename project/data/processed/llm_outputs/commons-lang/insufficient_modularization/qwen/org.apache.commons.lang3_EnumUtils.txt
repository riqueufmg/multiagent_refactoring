    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.EnumUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 23 methods (nom=23) with 20 public methods (nopm=20), high weighted method count (wmc=30), and 322 lines of code (loc=322), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The class could benefit from decomposition to reduce its implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
