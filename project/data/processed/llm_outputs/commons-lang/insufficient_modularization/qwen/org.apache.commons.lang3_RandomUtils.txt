    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 29 methods with 314 lines of code, which is within reasonable limits for a utility class. The WMC of 34 indicates moderate complexity. The LCOM value of 0.17 suggests good cohesion among methods. With 6 fields and mostly public static methods (25 out of 29), this appears to be a well-structured utility class that is appropriately modularized for its purpose of providing random utility methods."
