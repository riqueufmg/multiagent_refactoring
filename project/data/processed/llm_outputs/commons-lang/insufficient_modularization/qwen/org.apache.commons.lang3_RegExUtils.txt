    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.RegExUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom=21) with 20 being public (nopm=20), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 26 (wmc=26), suggesting high complexity. With 280 lines of code (loc=280) and only 1 field (nof=1), this class concentrates too many regex utility operations in a single class rather than being decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The high method count and complexity suggest insufficient modularization where related methods could be grouped into separate specialized classes."
