{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.InheritanceUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 34 lines of code (loc=34), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 public methods that are likely related to inheritance utility functions, this class appears to have appropriate modularization for its simple responsibility."
