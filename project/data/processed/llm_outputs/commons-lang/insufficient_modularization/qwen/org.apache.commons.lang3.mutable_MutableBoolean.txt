{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableBoolean",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 16 methods (nom=16) and 138 lines of code (loc=138), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=17) indicates low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class is already well-decomposed. The low LCOM value (0.125) suggests good cohesion, and the lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates simplicity. The class represents a simple mutable boolean wrapper with appropriate functionality and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
