{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.NumberRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (WMC=1), 19 lines of code, 3 nested classes, and no dependencies. The metrics indicate a simple, well-encapsulated class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low WMC and minimal complexity suggest the class is appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
