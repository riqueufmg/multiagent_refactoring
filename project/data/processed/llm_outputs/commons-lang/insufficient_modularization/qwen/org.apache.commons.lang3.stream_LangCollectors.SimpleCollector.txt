    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.stream.LangCollectors.SimpleCollector",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 0 methods, with 34 lines of code. The low number of fields and methods indicates proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. WMC of 0 and LCOM of -1.0 further indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further modularization."
