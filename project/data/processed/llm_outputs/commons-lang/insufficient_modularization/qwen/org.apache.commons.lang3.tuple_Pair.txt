{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple.Pair",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16, nopm=16) and 159 lines of code (loc=159), which while substantial, does not indicate insufficient modularization given that all methods are public and likely represent the complete interface for a tuple pair class. The WMC of 18 indicates moderate complexity but is appropriate for a class providing 16 public methods. The LCOM of 0.375 suggests reasonable cohesion, and the class appears to be properly focused on its core responsibility as a pair tuple implementation."
