    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrLookup.SystemPropertiesStrLookup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, DIT is 1 showing no inheritance depth, and LCOM is -1.0 which is inconclusive. The class appears to be a simple, minimal implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed and has minimal size and complexity."
