{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.TimedSemaphore",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 21 methods (nom), 30 weighted method count (wmc), 309 lines of code (loc), and 17 fields (nof). The class also has a dependency on its own nested Builder class, suggesting it's managing multiple responsibilities including configuration building and timed semaphore logic within a single class structure."
