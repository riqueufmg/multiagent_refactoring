{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 52 methods (nom=52, nopm=52) and 703 lines of code (loc=703), indicating high size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=82) further confirms high implementation complexity. The high LCOM value (0.7307692307692307) suggests poor cohesion, meaning the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes. These metrics collectively indicate that the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce both size and implementation complexity."
