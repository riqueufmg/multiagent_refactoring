    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableCallable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 14 lines of code (loc=14). It has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no class hierarchy (dit=0). The class is already minimal in terms of size and complexity, with only a single method and no internal structure that could be further decomposed. The low LOC, minimal method count, and absence of complex relationships indicate sufficient modularization."
