    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ContextedRuntimeException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 126 lines of code (loc=126), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=15) indicates moderate complexity. The class has a low Lack of Cohesion (lcom=0.1428571428571428), suggesting good internal cohesion. The class depends on only 2 other classes, indicating focused responsibilities. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, its current size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as a significant issue."
