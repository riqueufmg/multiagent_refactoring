    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 18 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). There are no functional dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no fields (nof=0). The lack of methods and minimal size indicates this is likely an interface or very simple abstract class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
