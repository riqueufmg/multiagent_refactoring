    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 45 methods (nom=45) with 42 public methods (nopm=42), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 71 (wmc=71), suggesting high complexity. With 585 lines of code (loc=585), the class is large and could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The high method count and complexity suggest that further modularization would improve maintainability."
