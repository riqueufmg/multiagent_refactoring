    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrBuilder.StrBuilderReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 89 lines of code. The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No other complexity metrics (no inheritance, no coupling) suggest insufficient modularization."
