```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 377 methods (nom) with 367 public methods (nopm), 25 fields (nof), and 5740 lines of code (loc). The high number of methods and lines of code indicates the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity. The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) value of 870 further supports this indication of high complexity."
