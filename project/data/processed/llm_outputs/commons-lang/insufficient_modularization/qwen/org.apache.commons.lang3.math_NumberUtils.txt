    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 68 methods (nom=68) with 21 public methods (nopm=21), 1271 lines of code (loc=1271), and a weighted method count of 196 (wmc=196). These metrics indicate high complexity and size that could benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The class implements numerous number utility functions that could be logically grouped into separate modules."
