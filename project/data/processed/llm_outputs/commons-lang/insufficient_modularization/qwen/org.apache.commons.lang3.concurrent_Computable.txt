    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 16 lines of code (loc=16), and no fields (nof=0). It represents a simple functional interface with minimal complexity that does not require further decomposition. The low number of methods and small size indicate sufficient modularization."
