    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 130 fields (nof=130) and 128 private fields (nopf=128), indicating a large amount of data encapsulated in a single class. With only 23 methods (nom=23) and 952 lines of code (loc=952), the class is data-heavy but method-light, suggesting insufficient decomposition. The high LCOM value of 0.739 indicates poor cohesion, meaning many methods do not access the same instance variables, which is a strong indicator that the class should be split into multiple cohesive modules. The class also has a WMC of 29, which is relatively high for the number of methods, indicating complex internal structure that could benefit from modularization."
