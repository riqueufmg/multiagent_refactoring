{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 59 methods (nom) and 27 public methods (nopm), with a total of 1363 lines of code (loc). The weighted method count (wmc) is 236, indicating high complexity. The class also has 12 fields (nof) and depends on 7 other classes, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. These metrics indicate the class is large and complex enough that further decomposition could reduce its size and implementation complexity."
