    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 28 lines of code (loc=28), and minimal structural complexity (wmc=0, dit=1). The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
