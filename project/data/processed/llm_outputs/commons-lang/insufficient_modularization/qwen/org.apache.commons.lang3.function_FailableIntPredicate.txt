    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableIntPredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 65 lines of code (loc=65), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=6) indicates low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to have a focused responsibility. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, nc=0) suggests proper modularization without excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
