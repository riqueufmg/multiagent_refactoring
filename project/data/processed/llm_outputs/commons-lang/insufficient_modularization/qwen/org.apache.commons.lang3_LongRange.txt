    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.LongRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 53 lines of code (loc=53), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=5) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and good cohesion (lcom=1.0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low number of methods and fields suggests appropriate decomposition has already been achieved."
