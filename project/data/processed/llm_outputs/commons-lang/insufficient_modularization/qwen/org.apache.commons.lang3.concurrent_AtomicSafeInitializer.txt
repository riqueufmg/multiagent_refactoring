    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AtomicSafeInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods and WMC of 9, which is manageable. It has only 95 lines of code, indicating reasonable size. The LCOM value of 0.714 suggests good cohesion within the class. The class has 3 fields and 4 public methods, showing a clear and focused interface. The dependency count is limited to 4 external types, indicating controlled coupling. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
