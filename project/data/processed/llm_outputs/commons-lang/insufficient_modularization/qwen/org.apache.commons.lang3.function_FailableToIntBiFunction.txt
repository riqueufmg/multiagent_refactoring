    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableToIntBiFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 31 lines of code (loc=31), which indicates a very small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no dependencies, this class appears to be well-modularized and serves a single, specific purpose as suggested by its name (converting a bi-function to int with failure handling). The size and complexity are appropriate for its functional role."
