```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeLiteral",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom), 7 weighted method count (wmc), 39 lines of code (loc), and 3 fields (nof). The lack of children (nc=0) and depth of inheritance (dit=1) indicates it's a simple, standalone class. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class. The small number of methods and fields, combined with low complexity metrics, indicates sufficient modularization has been achieved."
