    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AbstractCircuitBreaker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 119 lines of code (loc=119), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=12) indicates moderate complexity. The lack of fan-in (fanin=0) and fan-out (fanout=0) dependencies suggests this class is relatively isolated, and the low LCOM value (lcom=0.2727272727272727) indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be properly modularized with appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
