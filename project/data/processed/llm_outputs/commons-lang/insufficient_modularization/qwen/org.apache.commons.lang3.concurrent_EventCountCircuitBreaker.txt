{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.EventCountCircuitBreaker",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 19 methods (nom=19) and a weighted method count of 22 (wmc=22), indicating significant implementation complexity. The class also contains 316 lines of code (loc=316) and manages multiple dependencies including inner classes and external dependencies, suggesting it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
