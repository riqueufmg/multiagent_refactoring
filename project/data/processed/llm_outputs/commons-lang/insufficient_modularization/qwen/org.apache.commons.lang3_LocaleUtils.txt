```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.LocaleUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 43 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 291 indicating a large class size, NOM (Number of Methods) is 21 which is excessive for a single class, and it has 7 fields with only 11 public methods out of 21 total methods suggesting complex internal structure. The high WMC value specifically indicates the class has too many complex methods that should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
