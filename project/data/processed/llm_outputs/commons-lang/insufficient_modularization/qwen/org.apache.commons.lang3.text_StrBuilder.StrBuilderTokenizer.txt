    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrBuilder.StrBuilderTokenizer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 29 lines of code (loc=29). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, DIT is 1 showing no inheritance depth, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple, well-modularized component with minimal responsibilities."
