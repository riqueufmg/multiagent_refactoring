{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.UncheckedException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 14 lines of code (loc=14), and 4 nested classes (nc=4). The low number of methods and low cyclomatic complexity indicate that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple exception wrapper with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
