{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Range",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 27 methods (nom=27) with 26 of them being public (nopm=26), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=47) is high, suggesting significant implementation complexity. With 373 lines of code (loc=373), the class is large in size. The high number of methods and lines of code suggest that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity, which are key indicators of Insufficient Modularization."
