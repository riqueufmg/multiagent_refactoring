    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.StandardToStringStyle",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 41 methods (nom=41, nopm=41) and 302 lines of code (loc=302), indicating high size and complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no inheritance (dit=1), this suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its implementation complexity and improve maintainability. The high method count relative to fields indicates potential grouping of related functionality that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
