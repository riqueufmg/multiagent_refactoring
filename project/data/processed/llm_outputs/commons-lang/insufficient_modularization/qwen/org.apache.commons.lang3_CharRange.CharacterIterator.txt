{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharRange.CharacterIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 89 lines of code (loc=89). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0, nopf=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity. While the class is nested within CharRange, its low complexity and small size do not indicate insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
