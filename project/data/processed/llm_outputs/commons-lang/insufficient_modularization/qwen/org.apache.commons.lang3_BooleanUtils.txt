{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.BooleanUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 47 methods (nom=47, nopm=47) and 674 lines of code (loc=674), indicating high size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=107) further confirms high implementation complexity. With 7 fields (nof=7) and 6 public fields (nopf=6), the class contains substantial data and behavior that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high LCOM value (0.489) suggests poor cohesion, indicating that the class may be doing too many unrelated things and would benefit from further modularization."
