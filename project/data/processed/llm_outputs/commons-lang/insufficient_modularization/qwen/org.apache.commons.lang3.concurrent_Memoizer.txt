    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.Memoizer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (76 LOC, 6 methods) and low complexity (WMC=8). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates good cohesion, and the single inheritance level (DIT=1) suggests appropriate decomposition. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies indicate this class is relatively self-contained with appropriate modularization."
