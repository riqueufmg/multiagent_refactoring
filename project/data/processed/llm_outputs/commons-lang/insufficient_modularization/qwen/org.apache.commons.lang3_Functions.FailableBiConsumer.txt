    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 16 lines of code and 0 methods. The metrics indicate minimal functionality with no fields, no methods, and no dependencies. While the class is simple, it appears to be a functional interface or placeholder that doesn't exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization - it's appropriately sized for its purpose and doesn't contain multiple responsibilities that need decomposition."
