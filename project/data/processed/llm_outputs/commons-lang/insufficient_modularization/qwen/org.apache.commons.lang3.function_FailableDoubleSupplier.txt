    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 13 lines of code (loc=13). It has no dependencies and implements a single, focused responsibility as a functional interface for supplying double values. The class is already sufficiently decomposed with minimal complexity and size."
