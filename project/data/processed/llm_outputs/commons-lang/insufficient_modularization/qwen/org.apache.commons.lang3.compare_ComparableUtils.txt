    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.compare.ComparableUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) with 9 being public (nopm=9), which indicates a focused responsibility. The lines of code (loc=171) are reasonable for a utility class. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low complexity (wmc=10) suggest proper modularization. The class appears to be a well-contained utility class with a single responsibility for comparable operations."
