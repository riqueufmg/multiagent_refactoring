    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DatePrinter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) and 100 lines of code (loc=100), which represents a moderate size. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no fields (nof=0), the class appears to have a reasonable level of complexity for its functionality. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) equals the number of methods, indicating straightforward method complexity. Without additional context about the specific responsibilities or implementation details, the metrics do not clearly indicate insufficient modularization."
