```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) with 10 public methods (nopm=10), high Weighted Method Count (wmc=19), and 202 lines of code (loc=202). The high number of methods and complexity suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates moderate lack of cohesion, supporting the need for better modularization."
