    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ThreadUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 25 methods (nom=25) with 22 public methods (nopm=22), which indicates a focused utility class design. The weighted method count (wmc=31) and lines of code (loc=389) are reasonable for a utility class providing thread-related functionality. The class has low complexity (lcom=0.2) and minimal dependencies (4 dependencies), suggesting good cohesion and focused responsibility. The method-to-field ratio (25 methods to 3 fields) indicates the class is not overly complex for its functionality."
