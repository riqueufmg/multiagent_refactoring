    "justification": "The class has 91 lines of code which is relatively small, has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0), no dependencies, and is a simple inner class (dit=1). The lack of methods and low complexity (wmc=0) indicates it is already well modularized for its current functionality."
