    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharSequenceUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: WMC of 63 is very high, LOC of 271 exceeds typical single-class size limits, and LCOM of 0.667 suggests poor cohesion. With only 9 methods but high weighted method complexity, the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
