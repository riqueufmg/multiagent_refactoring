    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ArraySorter",

    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) with all being public (nopm=10), indicating a focused set of responsibilities. The lines of code (loc=123) and weighted method count (wmc=19) are relatively low, suggesting manageable complexity. The lack of fields (nof=0) and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates a simple, focused utility class that is appropriately modularized for its purpose."
