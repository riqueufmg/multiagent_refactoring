{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastTimeZone",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low complexity with WMC of 10 and only 6 methods. The LCOM value of 0.333 indicates good cohesion. With only 55 lines of code and 2 fields, the class is relatively small and well-contained. The low number of methods (6) and fields (2) suggests adequate modularization without excessive complexity that would require further decomposition."
