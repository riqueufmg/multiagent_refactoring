    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.CloneFailedException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3), 29 lines of code (loc=29), and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and simple structure indicates proper modularization. No complex dependencies or high complexity metrics suggest insufficient modularization."
