    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.stream.IntStreams",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 37 lines of code (loc=37), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this appears to be a simple utility class that is already well-modularized. The lack of complex internal structure (nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0) further supports that additional decomposition is not necessary."
