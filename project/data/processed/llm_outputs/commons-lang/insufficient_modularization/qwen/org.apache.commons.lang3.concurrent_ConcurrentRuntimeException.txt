```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentRuntimeException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 32 lines of code (loc=32), and weighted method count of 3 (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and low LCOM value (lcom=1.0) indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple exception wrapper with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
