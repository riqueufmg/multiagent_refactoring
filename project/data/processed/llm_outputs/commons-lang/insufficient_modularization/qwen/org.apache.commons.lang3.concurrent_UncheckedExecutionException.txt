    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.UncheckedExecutionException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 14 lines of code (loc=14), no fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low complexity metrics indicate proper modularization for this exception class which serves a single focused purpose."
