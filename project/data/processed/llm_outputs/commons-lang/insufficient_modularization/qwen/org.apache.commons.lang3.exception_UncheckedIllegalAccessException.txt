{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.UncheckedIllegalAccessException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), and very low lines of code (loc=14). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 1 (wmc=1), indicating minimal functional complexity. LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple data holder or exception wrapper with no signs of insufficient modularization as it lacks the complexity that would require further decomposition."
