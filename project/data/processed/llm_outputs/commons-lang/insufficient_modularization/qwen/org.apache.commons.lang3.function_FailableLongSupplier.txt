    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=0), 13 lines of code (loc=13), and very low complexity (wmc=1). With such minimal size and complexity, there is no indication that further decomposition would be beneficial. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its simple functionality."
