    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBiFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 44 lines of code (loc=44), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no static fields (nopf=0), the class is not overly complex in terms of data. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and minimal dependencies (only one dependency to FailableFunction) suggest proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple functional interface implementation with appropriate size and complexity."
