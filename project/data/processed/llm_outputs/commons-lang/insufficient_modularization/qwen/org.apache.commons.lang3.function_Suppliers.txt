    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 34 lines of code (loc=34), which indicates a small and focused class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=3), and there are no complex dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
