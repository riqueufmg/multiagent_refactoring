    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.NumericEntityEscaper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods and WMC of 10, but LCOM of 0.286 indicates good cohesion. With only 78 lines of code and 3 fields, the class size is reasonable. The class appears to have a single responsibility for numeric entity escaping functionality. While further decomposition could theoretically be possible, the current level of modularization is sufficient given the class's focused responsibility and manageable complexity metrics."
