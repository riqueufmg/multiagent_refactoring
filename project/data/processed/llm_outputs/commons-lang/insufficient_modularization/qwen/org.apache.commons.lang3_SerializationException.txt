    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 38 lines of code (loc=38), which indicates a small and simple class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=4), and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) or complex relationships (lcom=1.0). The class appears to be a simple exception class with minimal complexity that does not require further decomposition."
