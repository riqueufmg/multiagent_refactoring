    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableDoubleConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 41 lines of code (loc=41), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains good encapsulation. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, nc=0) indicate proper modularization for a small utility class."
