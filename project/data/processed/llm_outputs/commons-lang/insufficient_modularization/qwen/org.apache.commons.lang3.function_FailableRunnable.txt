    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 12 lines of code (loc=12). It has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no implementation complexity (wmc=1). The class is already minimal and well-decomposed for its functionality as a functional interface with a single run() method."
