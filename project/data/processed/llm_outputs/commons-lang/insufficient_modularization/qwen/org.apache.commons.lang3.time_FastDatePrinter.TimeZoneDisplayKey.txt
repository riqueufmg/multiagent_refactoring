    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.TimeZoneDisplayKey",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 44 lines of code (loc=44), and no dependencies. The metrics indicate a simple data holder class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. WMC=0 and LCOM=-1.0 suggest minimal method complexity and good cohesion for such a simple class."
