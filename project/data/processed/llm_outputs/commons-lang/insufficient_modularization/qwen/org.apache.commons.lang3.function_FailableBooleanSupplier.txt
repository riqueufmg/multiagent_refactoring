    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=0), very few lines of code (loc=13), and minimal complexity (wmc=1). With such a small size and low complexity, there is no indication that further decomposition would provide benefits. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its minimal functionality."
