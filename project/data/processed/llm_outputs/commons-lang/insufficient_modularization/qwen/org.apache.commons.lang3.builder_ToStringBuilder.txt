{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 63 methods (nom=63, nopm=63) and 646 lines of code (loc=646), indicating high size and complexity. The high number of methods suggests the class may contain multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) value of 68 further confirms high implementation complexity. The class appears to be doing too much work and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and complexity."
