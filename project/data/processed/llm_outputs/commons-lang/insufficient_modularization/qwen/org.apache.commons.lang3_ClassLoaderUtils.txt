    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 51 lines of code (loc=51), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=7) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and high cohesion (lcom=0.667), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
