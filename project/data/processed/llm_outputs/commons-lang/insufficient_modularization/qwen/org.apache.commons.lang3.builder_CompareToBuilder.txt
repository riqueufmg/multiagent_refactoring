    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 31 methods (nom), 29 public methods (nopm), 620 lines of code (loc), and weighted method count of 115 (wmc). These metrics suggest the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
