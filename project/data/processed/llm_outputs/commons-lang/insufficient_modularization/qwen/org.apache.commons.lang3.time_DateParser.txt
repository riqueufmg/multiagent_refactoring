    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 methods (nom=8) and 62 lines of code (loc=62), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=8) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no fields (nof=0), the class does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's a simple interface or utility class that is properly modularized."
