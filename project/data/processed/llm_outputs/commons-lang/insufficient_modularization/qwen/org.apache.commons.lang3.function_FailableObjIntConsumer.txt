    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 1 field (nof=1), with a low weighted method count (wmc=2). The lines of code (loc=30) indicate a very small class. With minimal complexity and size, there is insufficient evidence to suggest further decomposition would provide meaningful benefits. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
