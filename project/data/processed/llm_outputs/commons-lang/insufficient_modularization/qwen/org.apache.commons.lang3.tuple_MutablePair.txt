    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple.MutablePair",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) and 141 lines of code (loc=141), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=13) indicates moderate complexity. The Lack of Cohesion metric (lcom=0.416) suggests reasonable cohesion among methods. With only 4 fields (nof=4) and 3 public fields (nopf=3), the class is not overly complex in terms of data. The class has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1), indicating it's a standalone, well-contained class that doesn't require further decomposition."
