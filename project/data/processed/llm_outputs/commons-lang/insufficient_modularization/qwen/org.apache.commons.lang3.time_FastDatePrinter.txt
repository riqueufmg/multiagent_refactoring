{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 102 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 1132 indicating a large class size, NOM (Number of Methods) is 32 which is high, and NOF (Number of Fields) is 42 indicating many fields. The class also has a high number of dependencies (20) suggesting it has too many responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
