    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayFill",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) with 10 being public (nopm=10), which indicates a reasonable level of decomposition. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 22, which is moderate. The class has 146 lines of code (loc=146), which is not excessively large. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the metrics do not indicate a clear case of insufficient modularization as the method count and complexity are within reasonable limits for a utility class."
