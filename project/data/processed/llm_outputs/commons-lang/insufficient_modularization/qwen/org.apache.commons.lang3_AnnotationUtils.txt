    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.AnnotationUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 51 which is very high, indicating excessive method complexity. The class has 12 methods (NOM) and 268 lines of code (LOC), averaging ~22 lines per method which suggests complex implementations. The LCOM value of 0.4166666666666667 indicates poor cohesion, meaning methods are not closely related to each other. These metrics combined with the multiple dependencies on other utility classes suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
