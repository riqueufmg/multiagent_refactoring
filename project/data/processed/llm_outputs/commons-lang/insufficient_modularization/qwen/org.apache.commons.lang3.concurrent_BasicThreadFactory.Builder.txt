{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.BasicThreadFactory.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 0 methods, with 106 lines of code. While the LOC is relatively high for the number of fields, the lack of methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and simple structure (dit=1, no inheritance) indicates it is already well-decomposed. The Builder pattern implementation appears appropriately modularized for its functionality."
