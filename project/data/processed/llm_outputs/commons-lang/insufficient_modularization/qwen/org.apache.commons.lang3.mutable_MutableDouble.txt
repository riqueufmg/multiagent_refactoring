{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableDouble",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 32 methods (nom=32) but all are public (nopm=32), indicating they are all part of the public interface. The WMC equals the number of methods (wmc=32), suggesting each method has a cyclomatic complexity of 1. The class has low lines of code (loc=280) and only 2 fields (nof=2). The LCOM value is very low (0.0625), indicating good cohesion. The class represents a simple mutable wrapper for double values with no complex logic, so its current level of modularization is appropriate for its functionality."
