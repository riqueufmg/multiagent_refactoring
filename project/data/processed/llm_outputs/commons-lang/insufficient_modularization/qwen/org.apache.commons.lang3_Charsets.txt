    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Charsets",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3) and 31 lines of code (loc=31), which indicates a very small and simple class. With 0 fields (nof=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be properly modularized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low complexity metrics suggest it is appropriately decomposed."
