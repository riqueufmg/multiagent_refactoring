{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.MethodUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 34 methods (nom=34) with 26 public methods (nopm=26), high weighted method count (wmc=76), and 674 lines of code (loc=674). The high number of methods and complexity metrics indicate the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
