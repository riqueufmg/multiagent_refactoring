    "justification": "The class has very low complexity (WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1), minimal size (LOC=22), no dependencies, and appears to be a simple predicate class. While it could potentially be decomposed further, its minimal complexity and size do not indicate insufficient modularization as a significant smell."
