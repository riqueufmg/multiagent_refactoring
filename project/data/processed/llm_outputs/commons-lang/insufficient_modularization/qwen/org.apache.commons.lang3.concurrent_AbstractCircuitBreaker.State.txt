    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely an empty or minimal class. With only 31 lines of code (loc=31) and no complexity metrics (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0), there is insufficient implementation complexity or size to warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be properly modularized given its minimal nature."
