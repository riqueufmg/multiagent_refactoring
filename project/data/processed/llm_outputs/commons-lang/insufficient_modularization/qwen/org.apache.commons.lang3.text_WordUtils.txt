    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.WordUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15) with a weighted method count of 51 (wmc=51), indicating high complexity. The class contains 304 lines of code (loc=304) which is substantial for a single class. With 14 public methods (nopm=14), the class exposes a large interface that could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The high WMC value suggests the class has significant implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition."
