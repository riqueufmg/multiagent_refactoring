    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 27 lines of code, 1 field, and 0 methods. It has no dependencies, no inheritance (DIT=0), and no coupling metrics indicating simplicity. The low WMC (0) and lack of methods suggest this is likely an enum or simple data class that is already sufficiently modularized for its purpose."
