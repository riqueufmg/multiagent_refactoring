    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtils.ModifyType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. This appears to be a simple enum or data class that is already sufficiently modularized. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already minimal in size and complexity."
