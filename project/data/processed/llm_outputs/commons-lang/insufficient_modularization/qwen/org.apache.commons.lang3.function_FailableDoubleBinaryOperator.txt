    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableDoubleBinaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=0), 15 lines of code (loc=15), and very low complexity (wmc=1). The low number of methods and minimal code size indicate that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. There are no fields or complex dependencies that would suggest the need for further decomposition."
