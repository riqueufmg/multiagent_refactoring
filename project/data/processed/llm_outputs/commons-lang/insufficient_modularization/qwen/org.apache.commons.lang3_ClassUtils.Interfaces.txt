    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ClassUtils.Interfaces",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating no computational complexity. The LCOM value is -1.0 which typically indicates either no methods or a cohesive design. With minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly simplified and does not require further decomposition."
