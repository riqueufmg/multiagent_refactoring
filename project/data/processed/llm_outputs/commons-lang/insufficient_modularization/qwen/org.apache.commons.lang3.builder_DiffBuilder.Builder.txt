    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.DiffBuilder.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 0 methods, with 69 lines of code. While the LOC count is moderate, the low number of fields and methods indicates reasonable decomposition. The class appears to be a simple builder pattern implementation with minimal complexity (wmc=0, nom=0). There is insufficient evidence of incomplete decomposition or excessive size/complexity that would warrant further modularization."
