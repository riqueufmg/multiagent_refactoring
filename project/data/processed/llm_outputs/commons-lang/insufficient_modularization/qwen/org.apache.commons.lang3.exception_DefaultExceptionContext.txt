    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (99 LOC, 9 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=13). The LCOM value of 0.222 indicates good cohesion, and the class has only 2 fields with no public fields (NOF=2, NPF=0, NC=0). The method count (9) and complexity metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
