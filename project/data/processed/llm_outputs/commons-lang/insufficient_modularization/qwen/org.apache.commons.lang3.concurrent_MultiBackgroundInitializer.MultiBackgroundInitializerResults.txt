    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.MultiBackgroundInitializer.MultiBackgroundInitializerResults",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 94 lines of code (loc=94). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is a simple data holder or result container class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The nested class appears to be appropriately modularized for its purpose."
