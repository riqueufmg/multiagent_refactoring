    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 14 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). There are no functional dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no fields (nof=0). The minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as there is no evidence of functionality that needs further decomposition."
