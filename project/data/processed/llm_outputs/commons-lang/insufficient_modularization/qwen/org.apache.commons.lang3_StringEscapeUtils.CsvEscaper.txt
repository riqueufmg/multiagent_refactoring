    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtils.CsvEscaper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields (nof=4), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and minimal size (loc=20). The lack of methods and low field count indicates it is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
