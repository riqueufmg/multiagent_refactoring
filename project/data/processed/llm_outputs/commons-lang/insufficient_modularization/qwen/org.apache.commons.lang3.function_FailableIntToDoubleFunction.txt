    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableIntToDoubleFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 1 field (nof=1), with very low complexity (wmc=2, loc=26). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity metrics, indicates that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of functionality that could be further decomposed into separate modules or classes."
