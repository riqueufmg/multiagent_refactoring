    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBiPredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 72 lines of code (loc=72), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low implementation complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0), the class appears to be well-contained and focused on a single responsibility. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's not overly coupled with other components."
