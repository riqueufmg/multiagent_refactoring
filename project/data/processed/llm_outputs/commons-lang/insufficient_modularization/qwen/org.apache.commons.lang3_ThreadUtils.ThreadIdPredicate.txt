    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 21 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0). It appears to be a simple data class or predicate with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. The low size and complexity indicate sufficient modularization."
