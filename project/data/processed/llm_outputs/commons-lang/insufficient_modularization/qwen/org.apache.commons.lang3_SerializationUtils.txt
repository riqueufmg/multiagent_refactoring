    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.SerializationUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods (nom=7) with all being public (nopm=7), indicating a focused responsibility. The lines of code (loc=145) and weighted method count (wmc=8) are relatively low, suggesting manageable complexity. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.4285714285714285) indicate the class is reasonably cohesive and not overly complex, thus does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
