    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (124 LOC, 11 methods) and low complexity (WMC=11, DIT=1). The LCOM value of 0.27 indicates good cohesion within the class. With only 5 fields and no external dependencies, the class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality as a mutable triple data structure."
