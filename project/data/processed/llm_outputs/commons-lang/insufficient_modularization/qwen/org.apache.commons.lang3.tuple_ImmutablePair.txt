    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple.ImmutablePair",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (136 LOC, 11 methods) and low complexity (WMC=11). The LCOM value of 0.27 indicates good cohesion, and the class has minimal external dependencies (DIT=1, no fanin/fanout). The number of fields (5) and methods (11) suggests appropriate functional cohesion without excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
