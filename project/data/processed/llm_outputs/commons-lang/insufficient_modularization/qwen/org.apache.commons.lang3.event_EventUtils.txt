{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.event.EventUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 3 fields (nof=3), with low complexity (wmc=3) and reasonable size (loc=84). The LCOM value of 0.6666666666666666 indicates some cohesion issues but given the small number of methods, further decomposition would likely not improve modularity. The class appears to be appropriately sized and structured for its functionality."
