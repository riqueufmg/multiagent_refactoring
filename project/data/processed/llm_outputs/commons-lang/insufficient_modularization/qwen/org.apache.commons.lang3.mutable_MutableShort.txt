    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableShort",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 31 methods (nom=31, nopm=31) which indicates a relatively high number of methods for a single class. However, the WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 32 which is proportional to the number of methods, suggesting the methods are not overly complex. The LCOM value is 0.064516129032258 which is very low, indicating good cohesion among the methods. The class has only 274 lines of code (loc=274) which is manageable. With DIT=1, it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy, and having no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's a self-contained, simple class. The high number of methods is likely due to the nature of the mutable wrapper class requiring various arithmetic, comparison, and conversion operations, which is appropriate for its purpose."
