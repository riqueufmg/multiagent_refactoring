{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Strings",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 28 total methods (nom), 24 public methods (nopm), 563 lines of code (loc), and Weighted Methods per Class of 61 (wmc). These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The high number of methods and lines of code indicate insufficient modularization where the class has not been completely decomposed."
