    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 23 lines of code (loc). It has minimal responsibilities and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, well-focused component with only basic dependencies on CharUtils and Strings."
