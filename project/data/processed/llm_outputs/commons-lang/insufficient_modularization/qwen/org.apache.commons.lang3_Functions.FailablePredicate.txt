    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions.FailablePredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 15 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0). The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and the class appears to be a simple functional interface or minimal utility class that is already sufficiently modularized."
