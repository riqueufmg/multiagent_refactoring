{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.stream.Streams",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom=21) with 384 lines of code (loc=384), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of fields (nof=5, nc=0) and high ratio of private methods (nopm=18 out of nom=21) suggests poor decomposition of functionality. The WMC equals the number of methods (wmc=21), indicating simple method complexity but the overall class complexity remains high due to its size. The class contains inner class dependencies (Streams.FailableStream) which indicates potential for further modularization."
