    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.CodePointTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 3 fields (nof=0, nc=3) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
