    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ArchUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom) and 16 weighted method count (wmc) which indicates moderate complexity. With only 91 lines of code (loc) and 1 field (nof), the class is relatively small. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.2) suggests good internal cohesion. The class has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance (dit=0), indicating it's a simple utility class with focused responsibility. While further decomposition could theoretically be possible, the current level of modularization appears sufficient given its size and complexity."
