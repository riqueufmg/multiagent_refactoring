    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableIntToFloatFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0) and 1 field (nof=1), with a very low weighted method count (wmc=2). The class implements a single functional interface responsibility and has minimal complexity. The low number of methods and fields indicates proper modularization without unnecessary decomposition."
