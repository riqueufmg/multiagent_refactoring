    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks.LockingVisitors.LockVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 fields (nof=8) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 215 lines of code (loc=215). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the lack of methods suggests this may be a data-only class or interface rather than a complex implementation that needs decomposition. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further modularization."
