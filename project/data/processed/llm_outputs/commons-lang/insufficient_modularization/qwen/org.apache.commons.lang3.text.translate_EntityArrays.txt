{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArrays",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) with all being public static methods (nopm=12), indicating a utility class pattern. The WMC of 13 suggests low complexity, LCOM of 1.0 indicates good cohesion, and with only 106 lines of code (loc=106) and 10 fields (nof=10), the class is reasonably sized. The class appears to be a well-encapsulated utility class for entity array operations without signs of insufficient modularization."
