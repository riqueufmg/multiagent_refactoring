    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 53 lines of code (loc=53), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=5) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 0 package dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
