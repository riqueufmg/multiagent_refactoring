    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 67 methods (nom), 128 weighted method count (wmc), 1095 lines of code (loc), and 14 fields (nof). The high number of methods and fields combined with substantial lines of code suggests the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
