{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.DiffBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 27 methods (nom), 421 lines of code (loc), and a weighted method count of 38 (wmc). The class implements 23 public methods (nopm) with only 15 fields (nof), suggesting a high ratio of behavior to state that could benefit from decomposition. The low LCOM value (0.074) indicates methods are cohesive, but the overall size and method count suggest the class has not been completely decomposed and could be further modularized to reduce complexity."
