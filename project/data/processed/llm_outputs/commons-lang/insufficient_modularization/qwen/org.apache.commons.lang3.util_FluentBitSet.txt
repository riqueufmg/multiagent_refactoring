{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.util.FluentBitSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 44 methods (nom=44, nopm=44) and 396 lines of code (loc=396), indicating high size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=49) further confirms high implementation complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no dependencies, this suggests the class could benefit from decomposition to reduce its size and complexity through better modularization."
