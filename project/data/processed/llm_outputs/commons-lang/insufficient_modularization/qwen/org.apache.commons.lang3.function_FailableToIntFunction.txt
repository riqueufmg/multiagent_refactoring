    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableToIntFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a very small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no parameters in methods (nopm=0, nopf=0), the class exhibits simple structure and low implementation complexity. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance (dit=0) further supports that this is a well-contained, simple functional interface that does not require further decomposition."
