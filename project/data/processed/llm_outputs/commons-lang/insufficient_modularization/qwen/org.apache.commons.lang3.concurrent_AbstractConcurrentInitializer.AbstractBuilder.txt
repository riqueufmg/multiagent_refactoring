    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AbstractConcurrentInitializer.AbstractBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a very low LOC count of 54. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The WMC of 0 confirms there is no method complexity to address. While it has external dependencies, the class itself shows insufficient complexity to exhibit the Insufficient Modularization smell."
