```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrMatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) with only 5 attributes (nc=5), indicating a high method-to-field ratio that suggests mixed responsibilities. The WMC of 21 indicates high complexity for a single class, and the LCOM of 0.75 shows poor cohesion where many methods don't interact with the same fields. With 312 lines of code (loc=312), the class is large enough to benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes that would each handle specific matching responsibilities."
