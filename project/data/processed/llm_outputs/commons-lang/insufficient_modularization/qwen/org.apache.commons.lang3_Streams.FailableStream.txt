    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Streams.FailableStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 122 lines of code (loc=122). The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or configuration class rather than a complex business logic class that would benefit from modularization."
