    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateFormatUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18) and 251 lines of code (loc=251), which while substantial, does not indicate insufficient modularization given its purpose as a utility class for date formatting. The WMC of 18 matches the number of methods, suggesting each method has low complexity. The LCOM value of 0.611 suggests reasonable cohesion. With 15 fields (nof=15) and 14 public fields (nopf=14), the class maintains a clear utility class structure. The dependency on FastDateFormat is appropriate for a date formatting utility class."
