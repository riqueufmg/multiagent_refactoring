{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.BitField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods with only 2 fields, indicating reasonable decomposition. The WMC of 18 suggests moderate complexity but not excessive. With only 161 lines of code and no dependencies, the class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality. The LCOM of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the low method count relative to lines of code suggests appropriate method granularity."
