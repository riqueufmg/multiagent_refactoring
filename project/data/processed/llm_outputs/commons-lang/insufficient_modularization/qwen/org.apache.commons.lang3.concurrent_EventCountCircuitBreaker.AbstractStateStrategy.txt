    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0, wmc=0) and only 29 lines of code (loc=29). The absence of methods and minimal size indicates it is already sufficiently decomposed or represents a simple abstract base class that doesn't require further modularization."
