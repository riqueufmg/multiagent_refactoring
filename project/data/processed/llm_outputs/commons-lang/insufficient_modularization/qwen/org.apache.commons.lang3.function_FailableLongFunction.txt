    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no dependencies, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
