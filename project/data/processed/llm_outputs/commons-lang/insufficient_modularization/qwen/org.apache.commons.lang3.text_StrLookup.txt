    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrLookup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5, nopm=4), low WMC (5), and manageable LOC (89). The LCOM value of 1.0 indicates good cohesion, and the low number of fields (nof=3) suggests proper decomposition. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains reasonable size and complexity metrics."
