    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 53 lines of code (loc=53), and a low weighted method count (wmc=6). The low number of methods and lines of code indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
