{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.TimeZones",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4), minimal fields (nof=3), and relatively small size (loc=42). The LCOM value of 0.75 indicates some cohesion issues but given the small number of methods and fields, further decomposition would likely create unnecessary complexity rather than reduce it. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its current functionality."
