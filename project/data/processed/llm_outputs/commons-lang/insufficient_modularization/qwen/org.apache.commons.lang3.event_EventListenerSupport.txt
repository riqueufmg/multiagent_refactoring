{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.event.EventListenerSupport",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 15 methods (nom=15) and 17 weighted method count (wmc=17), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The lines of code (loc=219) is acceptable for a utility class handling event listener support functionality. The lack of fields (nof=5, all private) and low LCOM value (0.2666666666666666) suggests good cohesion. The class appears to have a single, well-defined responsibility for managing event listeners, and there's no clear indication that further decomposition would significantly reduce complexity or improve maintainability."
