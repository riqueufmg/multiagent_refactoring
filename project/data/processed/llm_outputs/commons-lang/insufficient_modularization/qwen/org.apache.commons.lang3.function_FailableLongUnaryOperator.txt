    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableLongUnaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 56 lines of code (loc=56), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no static fields (nopf=0), the class maintains simple state. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, nc=0) indicate proper modularization for a functional interface wrapper class."
