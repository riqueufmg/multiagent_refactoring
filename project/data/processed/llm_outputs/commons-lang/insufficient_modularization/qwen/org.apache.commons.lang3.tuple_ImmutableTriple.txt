    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 8 methods (nom=8, wmc=8), 113 lines of code which is reasonable for a simple data structure class, and follows single responsibility principle as indicated by low LCOM value (0.25). The class appears to be a well-contained immutable data structure with appropriate method count and complexity metrics that do not indicate insufficient modularization."
