    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields and 0 methods, with 44 lines of code. While it's a simple data holder, it represents a cohesive data structure for circuit breaker state management. The low complexity (WMC=0) and minimal scope suggest it's appropriately modularized for its purpose. No clear indication of functionality that should be further decomposed."
