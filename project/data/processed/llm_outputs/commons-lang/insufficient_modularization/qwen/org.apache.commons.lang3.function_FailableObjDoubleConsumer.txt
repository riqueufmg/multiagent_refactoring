    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableObjDoubleConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0) and 30 lines of code (loc=30), which indicates a small and focused implementation. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and serves a single, specific purpose without excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
