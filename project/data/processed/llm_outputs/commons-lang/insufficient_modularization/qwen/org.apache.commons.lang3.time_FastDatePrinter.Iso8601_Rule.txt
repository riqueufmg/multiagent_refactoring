    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with a low LOC count of 62. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal complexity. While it's a nested class, its size and complexity are within reasonable limits for its specialized ISO8601 formatting purpose, and further decomposition would likely not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
