    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.AppendableJoiner.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 69 lines of code (loc=69). While the class has a single dependency, the metrics indicate it is already well-decomposed with minimal complexity (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0). The low method count and simple structure suggest sufficient modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
