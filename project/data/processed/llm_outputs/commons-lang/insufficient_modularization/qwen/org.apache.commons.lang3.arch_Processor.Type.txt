    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.arch.Processor.Type",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 0 methods, 39 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple enum or data holder that is already sufficiently modularized."
