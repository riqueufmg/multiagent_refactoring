    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.CircuitBreakingException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 37 lines of code (loc=37), which indicates a small and focused class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=4), and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) or complex relationships (lcom=1.0). The class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains a simple, single-responsibility design."
