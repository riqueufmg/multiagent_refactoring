    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods (4 public) and 84 lines of code. The WMC of 8 indicates manageable complexity. LCOM of 0.833 suggests reasonable cohesion. The class has only 2 fields and follows a clear single responsibility pattern for lazy initialization. The size and complexity are within acceptable limits for a focused utility class."
