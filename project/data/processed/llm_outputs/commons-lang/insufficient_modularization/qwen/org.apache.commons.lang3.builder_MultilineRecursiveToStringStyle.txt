    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.MultilineRecursiveToStringStyle",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 126 lines of code (loc=126), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=15) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. The class has 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 public fields (nopf=0), showing proper encapsulation. The Lack of Cohesion metric (lcom=0.0) suggests good cohesion within the class. The dependency count is minimal (3 dependencies) and fanin/fanout are both 0, indicating the class is not overly coupled. While the class could potentially be decomposed, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization as the size and complexity are within acceptable ranges."
