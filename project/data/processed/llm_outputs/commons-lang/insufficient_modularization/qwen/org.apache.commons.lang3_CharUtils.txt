{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 26 methods (nom=26) and 255 lines of code (loc=255), which while substantial, does not indicate insufficient modularization given that all methods are public (nopm=26) suggesting they serve as a cohesive utility interface. The WMC of 28 indicates moderate complexity but is reasonable for a utility class. The LCOM value of 0.538 suggests reasonable cohesion, and the class appears to serve a single focused purpose as a character utility class."
