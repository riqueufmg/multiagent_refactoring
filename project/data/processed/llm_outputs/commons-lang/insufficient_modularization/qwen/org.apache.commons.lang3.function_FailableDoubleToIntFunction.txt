    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableDoubleToIntFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 26 lines of code (loc=26), which indicates a very small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and serves a single, specific purpose as a functional interface for converting double to int with failure handling capabilities."
