{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple.Triple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) and 14 weighted method count (wmc=14), which indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. The lines of code (loc=122) is reasonable for a class with this functionality. The lack of fan-in (fanin=0) and fan-out (fanout=0) dependencies, along with low coupling metrics (lcom=0.4166666666666667), suggests the class is well-contained and not overly complex. The number of fields (nof=2) and methods (nopf=1 public, nopm=12 total) indicates a focused, cohesive class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
