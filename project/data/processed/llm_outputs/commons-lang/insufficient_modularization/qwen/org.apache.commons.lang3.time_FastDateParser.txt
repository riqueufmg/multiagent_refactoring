    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 28 methods (nom), 77 weighted methods per class (wmc), 764 lines of code (loc), and 46 fields (nof). The high number of methods and fields suggests the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
