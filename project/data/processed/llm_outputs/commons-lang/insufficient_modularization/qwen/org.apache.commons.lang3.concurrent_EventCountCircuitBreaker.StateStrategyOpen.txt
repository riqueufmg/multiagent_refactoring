{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.EventCountCircuitBreaker.StateStrategyOpen",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The WMC (Weighted Method Count) is 0, indicating no complex methods. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion. Given the minimal size and complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed."
