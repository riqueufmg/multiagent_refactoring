    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrMatcher.StringMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 39 lines of code, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=1), and minimal structural complexity. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT of 1 shows no inheritance hierarchy. While the class could potentially be decomposed, its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, focused class with limited functionality."
