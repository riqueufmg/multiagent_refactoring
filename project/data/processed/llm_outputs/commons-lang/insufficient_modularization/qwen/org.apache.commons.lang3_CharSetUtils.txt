    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharSetUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 26 which is high for a class with only 9 methods, suggesting complex method implementations. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion in Methods) is -1.0 indicating poor cohesion. With 151 lines of code and 9 methods, the class concentrates too much functionality without proper decomposition, making it difficult to maintain and understand."
