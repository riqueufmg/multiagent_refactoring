```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.MemberUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 37 and 14 methods, suggesting it could be decomposed further. The LCOM value of 0.2857142857142857 indicates low cohesion, meaning the class likely contains methods that do not belong together and could be split into more focused, cohesive classes. With only 4 fields and 14 methods, the class has a moderate size but the complexity and cohesion metrics suggest insufficient modularization."
