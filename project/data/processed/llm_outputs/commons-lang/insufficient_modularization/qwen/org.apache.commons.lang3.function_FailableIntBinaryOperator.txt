    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableIntBinaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=0), 15 lines of code (loc=15), and a very low complexity (wmc=1). The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple functional interface with insufficient complexity to exhibit insufficient modularization."
