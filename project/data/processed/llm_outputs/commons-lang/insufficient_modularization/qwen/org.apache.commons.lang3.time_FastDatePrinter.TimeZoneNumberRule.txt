    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a low lines of code count (loc=41). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal complexity. The lack of methods and low complexity metrics suggest this class is already sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
