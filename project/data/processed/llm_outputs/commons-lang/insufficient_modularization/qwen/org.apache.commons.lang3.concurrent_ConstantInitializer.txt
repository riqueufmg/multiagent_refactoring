    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConstantInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (74 LOC, 7 methods) and low complexity (WMC=9). The LCOM value of 0.286 indicates good cohesion, and DIT=2 shows appropriate inheritance depth. The class appears to have a single responsibility of initializing constant values, and the metrics do not indicate excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
