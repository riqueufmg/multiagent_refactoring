```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AtomicInitializer.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 16 lines of code (loc=16). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies. This indicates a minimal, well-decomposed class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
