{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Predicates",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 29 lines of code (loc=29), and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and low LCOM value (lcom=1.0) indicates good cohesion. The absence of dependencies and low fan-in/fan-out metrics suggest this is a simple, well-contained utility class that does not require further decomposition."
