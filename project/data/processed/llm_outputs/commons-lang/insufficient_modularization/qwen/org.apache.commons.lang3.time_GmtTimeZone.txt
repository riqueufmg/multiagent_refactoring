    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.GmtTimeZone",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods with a WMC of 15, which indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. The LCOM value of 0.364 suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 60 lines of code and 6 fields, the class is relatively small and manageable. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates it's not tightly coupled to other classes. While there might be room for some refactoring, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization as the class appears to be of reasonable size and complexity."
