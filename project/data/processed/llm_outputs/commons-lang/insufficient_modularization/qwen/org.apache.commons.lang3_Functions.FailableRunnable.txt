    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 12 lines of code and 0 methods. It appears to be a simple functional interface or minimal utility class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The lack of methods (nom=0) and low size (loc=12) indicate it is already sufficiently decomposed."
