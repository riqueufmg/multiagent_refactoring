{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrTokenizer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 64 methods (nom=64) with 55 public methods (nopm=55), high Weighted Method Count (wmc=100), and 731 lines of code (loc=731). These metrics indicate excessive size and complexity for a single class, suggesting it has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its implementation complexity and size."
