    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ClassPathUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7, nopm=7) and 80 lines of code (loc=80), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=7) is low, suggesting low complexity. With no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this appears to be a simple utility class with appropriate modularization for its size and complexity."
