    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.TwoDigitNumberField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 36 lines of code (loc=36). With no methods present, there is no implementation complexity to decompose further. The class appears to be a simple field class with minimal functionality that does not require additional modularization."
