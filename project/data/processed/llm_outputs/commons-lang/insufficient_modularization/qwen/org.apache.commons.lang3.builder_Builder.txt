    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 12 lines of code (loc=12), and no fields (nof=0). The low number of methods and lines of code indicates minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple interface or minimal base class that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
