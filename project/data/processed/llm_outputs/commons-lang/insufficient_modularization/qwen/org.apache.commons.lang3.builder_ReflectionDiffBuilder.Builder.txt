```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionDiffBuilder.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), only 39 lines of code (loc=39), and no inheritance (dit=0, wmc=0). The low number of fields (nof=2) and lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate minimal responsibility. While the class could potentially be further decomposed, its extremely small size and low complexity do not constitute insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple builder pattern implementation with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
