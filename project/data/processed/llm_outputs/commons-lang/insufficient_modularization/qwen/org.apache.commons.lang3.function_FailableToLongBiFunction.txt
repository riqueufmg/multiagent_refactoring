    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 1 field (nof=1), with a low weighted method count (wmc=2) and only 31 lines of code (loc=31). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization for its purpose as a functional interface."
