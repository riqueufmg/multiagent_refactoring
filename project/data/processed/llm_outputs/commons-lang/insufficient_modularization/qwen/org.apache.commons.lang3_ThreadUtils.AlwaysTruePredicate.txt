    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is likely an empty or minimal class that does not contain complex functionality requiring further decomposition. With only 14 lines of code (loc=14) and no complexity metrics indicating high complexity (wmc=0, nc=0), there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately simple."
