{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods with a WMC of 23, which indicates moderate complexity. The LCOM value of 0.2857142857142857 suggests good cohesion within the class. With 273 lines of code, the class is of reasonable size. The low number of fields (9) and methods (14) indicates that the class is not overly complex and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be well-focused on its responsibility of handling character ranges."
