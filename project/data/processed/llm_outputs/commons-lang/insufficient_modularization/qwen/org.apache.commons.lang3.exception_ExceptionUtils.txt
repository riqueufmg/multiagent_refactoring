    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ExceptionUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 42 methods (nom), 36 public methods (nopm), 575 lines of code (loc), and WMC of 82. The high number of methods and lines of code suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
