    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.AbstractSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2) and 21 lines of code (loc=21), which indicates a very small and simple class. With 0 fields (nof=0) and only 1 public method (nopm=1), the class is already highly modularized. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=1) further supports that this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization - it is appropriately sized and decomposed for its purpose as an abstract supplier implementation."
