    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.EventCountCircuitBreaker.StateStrategyClosed",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies or coupling metrics that suggest complexity issues. The class appears to be a simple, well-decomposed component with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
