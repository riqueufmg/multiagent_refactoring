{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17) and 291 lines of code (loc=291), indicating high implementation complexity. It also has 24 fields (nof=24) with 16 private fields (nopf=16), suggesting significant data encapsulation that could be better distributed. The high number of methods and fields in a single class, combined with the substantial LOC count, indicates that further decomposition could reduce both size and implementation complexity."
