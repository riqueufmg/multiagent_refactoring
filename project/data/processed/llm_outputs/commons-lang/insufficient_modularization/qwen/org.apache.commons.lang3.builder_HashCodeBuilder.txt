{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.HashCodeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 37 methods (nom) with 31 public methods (nopm), 507 lines of code (loc), and a Weighted Method Count (wmc) of 72. The high number of methods and lines of code suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
