{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ExceptionContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7, wmc=7) and 50 lines of code (loc=50), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. With no fields (nof=0) and only 3 nested classes (nc=3), the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The low method count and moderate lines of code suggest sufficient modularization has already been achieved."
