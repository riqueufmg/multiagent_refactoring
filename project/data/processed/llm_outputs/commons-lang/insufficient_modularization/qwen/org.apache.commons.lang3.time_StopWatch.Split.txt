    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch.Split",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0, wmc=0) and only 35 lines of code (loc=35). The lack of methods and minimal size indicates it is already sufficiently decomposed. No further decomposition is needed as the class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal utility class."
