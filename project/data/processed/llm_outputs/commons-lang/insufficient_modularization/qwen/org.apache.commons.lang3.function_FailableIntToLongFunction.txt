    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableIntToLongFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 26 lines of code (loc=26), which indicates a very small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and serves a single, specific purpose as suggested by its name (converting int to long with failure handling capability). The low complexity metrics and small size do not indicate insufficient modularization."
