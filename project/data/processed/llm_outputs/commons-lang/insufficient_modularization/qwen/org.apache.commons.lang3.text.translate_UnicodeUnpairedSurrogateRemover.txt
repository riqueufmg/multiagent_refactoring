    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.UnicodeUnpairedSurrogateRemover",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 17 lines of code (loc=17), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is also very low, suggesting minimal complexity. With such a small size and low complexity, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already appropriately decomposed."
