```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionToStringBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 35 methods (nom), 29 public methods (nopm), 440 lines of code (loc), and weighted method count of 52 (wmc). With only 6 fields (nof) and 0 private fields (nopf), the class implements too much functionality within a single unit, indicating insufficient modularization. The high method count and complexity suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused components."
