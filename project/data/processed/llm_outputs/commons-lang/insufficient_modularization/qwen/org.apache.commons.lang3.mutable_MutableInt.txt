{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableInt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 30 methods (nom=30) and 267 lines of code (loc=267), which while substantial, is reasonable for a mutable integer wrapper class that needs to implement various numeric operations and comparisons. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 31, indicating moderate complexity. The class has no fields (nof=2, but nopf=0 suggests instance fields are minimal) and no dependencies, suggesting it's focused on its core responsibility. The low LCOM value (0.0666666666666666) indicates good cohesion among methods. For a utility class like MutableInt that wraps primitive operations, this level of complexity is acceptable and doesn't indicate insufficient modularization."
