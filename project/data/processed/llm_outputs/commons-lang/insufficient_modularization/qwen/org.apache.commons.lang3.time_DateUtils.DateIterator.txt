    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 43 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies. The class appears to be a simple data holder or iterator implementation that is already sufficiently modularized for its functionality."
