{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.UncheckedFuture",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 44 lines of code (loc=44), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. With no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies, the class appears to be well-modularized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low complexity metrics suggest the class is appropriately decomposed."
