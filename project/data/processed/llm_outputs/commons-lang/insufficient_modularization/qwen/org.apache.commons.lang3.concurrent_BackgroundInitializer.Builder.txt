    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=30 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and no dependencies. With no methods or significant functionality, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
