{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.JavaVersion",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods with a weighted method count of 43, which is moderate complexity. The lines of code (243) is reasonable for a class handling Java version detection and comparison logic. The class has low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and good cohesion (LCOM=0.0). The small number of fields (2) and methods (9) suggests appropriate encapsulation of related functionality without excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
