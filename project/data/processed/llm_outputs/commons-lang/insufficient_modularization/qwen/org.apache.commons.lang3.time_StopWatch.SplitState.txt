    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch.SplitState",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 lines of code and 0 methods, indicating it is already minimally implemented. With no fields, methods, or complex metrics, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be a simple enumeration or state holder that does not require further decomposition."
