    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ClassUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 66 methods (nom=66) with 59 public methods (nopm=59), indicating a large interface. The weighted method count is 157 (wmc=157), suggesting high complexity. With 1088 lines of code (loc=1088), this class is significantly large. The high number of methods and substantial LOC suggest that the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
