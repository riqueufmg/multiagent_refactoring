    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.UncheckedTimeoutException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), and very low lines of code (loc=14). The weighted method count (wmc=1) indicates minimal implementation complexity. With only 1 public method (nopm=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class already exhibits high cohesion (lcom=0.0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class represents a simple exception type with no complex functionality that would benefit from further decomposition."
