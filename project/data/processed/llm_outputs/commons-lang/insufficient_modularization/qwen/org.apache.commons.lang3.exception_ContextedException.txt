    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ContextedException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 126 lines of code (loc=126), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=15) indicates low complexity. The lack of fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.1428571428571428) suggest the class is focused. The class has no fan-in or fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicating it's relatively isolated. While it could potentially be decomposed further, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization as the class appears to be of appropriate size and complexity."
