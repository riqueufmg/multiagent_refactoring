    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Consumers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 32 lines of code (loc=32), and a low weighted method count (wmc=4). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low complexity metrics indicate this is a small, focused utility class that is appropriately modularized for its simple responsibility of providing consumer-related functionality."
