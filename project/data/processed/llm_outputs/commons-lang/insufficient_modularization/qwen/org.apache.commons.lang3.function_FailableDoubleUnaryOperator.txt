    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableDoubleUnaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 56 lines of code (loc=56), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=5) matches the number of methods, suggesting simple method complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this appears to be a well-contained, single-responsibility class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
