{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableLong",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 30 methods (nom=30) and 267 lines of code (loc=267), which while substantial, is within reasonable limits for a utility class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 31, indicating moderate complexity. The class has no fields (nof=2, nc=0) and no dependencies, suggesting it's a simple mutable wrapper class. The LCOM value of 0.0666666666666666 indicates good cohesion. While the method count is high, this appears to be a comprehensive utility class providing various operations for mutable long values, which is an acceptable design pattern. The metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class seems to have a single, well-defined responsibility."
