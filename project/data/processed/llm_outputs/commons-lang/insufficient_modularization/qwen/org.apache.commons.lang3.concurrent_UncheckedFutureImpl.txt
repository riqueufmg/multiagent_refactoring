    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.UncheckedFutureImpl",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 36 lines of code (loc=36), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 public methods (nopm=2) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1) further support that this is a well-contained, appropriately modularized class."
