    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Functions",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 5 public methods (nopm=5), with 78 lines of code (loc=78). The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, indicating low complexity. The class appears to be a utility class with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The metrics suggest the class is sufficiently modularized for its size and complexity."
