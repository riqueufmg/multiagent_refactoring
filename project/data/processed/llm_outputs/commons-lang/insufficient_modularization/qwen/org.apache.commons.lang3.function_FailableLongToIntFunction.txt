    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableLongToIntFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2), 1 field (nof=1), and 26 lines of code (loc=26). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity (wmc=2), indicates the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to have a single responsibility with appropriate size and complexity."
