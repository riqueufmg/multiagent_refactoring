    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.JavaUnicodeEscaper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 5 public), low lines of code (59), low weighted method count (6), and low depth of inheritance (3). These metrics indicate proper modularization with appropriate size and complexity for its functionality as a Unicode escaper utility."
