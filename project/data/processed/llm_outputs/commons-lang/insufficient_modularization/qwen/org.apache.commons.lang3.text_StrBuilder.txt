```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 150 methods (nom=150) with 145 public methods (nopm=145), high weighted method count (wmc=341), and 2304 lines of code (loc=2304), indicating excessive size and complexity that suggests insufficient modularization. The high number of methods and lines of code suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
