    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 17 lines of code and 0 methods, indicating it is already well-decomposed and minimal in size. The metrics show no functional complexity (wmc=0, nom=0) which suggests this is likely an interface or very simple class that does not require further decomposition."
