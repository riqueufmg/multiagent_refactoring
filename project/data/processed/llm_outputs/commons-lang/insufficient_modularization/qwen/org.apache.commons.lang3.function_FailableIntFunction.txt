    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableIntFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a very small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be well-encapsulated and appropriately modularized for its size and purpose."
