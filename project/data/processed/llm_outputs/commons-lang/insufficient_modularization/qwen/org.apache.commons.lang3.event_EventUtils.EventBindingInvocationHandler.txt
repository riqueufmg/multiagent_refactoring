    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 43 lines of code, which indicates a relatively simple class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) suggest the class is not overly complex and does not require further decomposition."
