    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.stream.LangCollectors",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (95 LOC) and complexity (WMC=6, NOM=6) for a utility class providing stream collectors. The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates moderate cohesion which is acceptable for this type of utility class. With only 6 methods and no complex dependencies beyond StringUtils, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
