    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.TimedSemaphore.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a low LOC count of 54. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest it is already sufficiently decomposed. The builder pattern implementation appears appropriately simple and focused."
