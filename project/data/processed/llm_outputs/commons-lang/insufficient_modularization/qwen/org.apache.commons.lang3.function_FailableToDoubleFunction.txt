    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and focused on a single responsibility. The size and complexity are appropriate for its functionality."
