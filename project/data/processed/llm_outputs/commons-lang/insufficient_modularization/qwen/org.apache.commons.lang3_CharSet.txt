    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharSet",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (159 LOC, 8 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=18). The LCOM value of 0.25 indicates good cohesion, and the dependency count is limited (2 dependencies). While further decomposition could theoretically be possible, the current modularization appears sufficient given the class's size and complexity metrics."
