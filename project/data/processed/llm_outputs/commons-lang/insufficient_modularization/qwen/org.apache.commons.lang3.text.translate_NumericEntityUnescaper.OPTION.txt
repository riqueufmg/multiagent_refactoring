    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). It appears to be an enum or simple data class with no functional behavior to decompose further. The metrics indicate minimal size and implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
