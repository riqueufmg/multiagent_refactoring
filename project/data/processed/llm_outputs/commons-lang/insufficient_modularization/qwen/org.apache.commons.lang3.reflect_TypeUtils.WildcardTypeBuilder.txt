    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeUtils.WildcardTypeBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 37 lines of code (loc=37), and no dependencies. The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed. The class appears to be a simple builder pattern implementation with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
