    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailablePredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 68 lines of code (loc=68), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to have a focused responsibility and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
