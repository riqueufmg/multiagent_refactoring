{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 244 methods (nom=244) with 4411 lines of code (loc=4411) and a weighted method count of 713 (wmc=713), indicating excessive size and complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. The high number of methods suggests the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from modularization to reduce its implementation complexity."
