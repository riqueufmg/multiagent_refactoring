    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.DiffResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) and 101 lines of code (loc=101), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=10) indicates moderate complexity. With only 6 fields (nof=6) and 1 public field (nopf=1), the class is not overly complex in terms of data management. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and no class coupling (nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests a relatively simple, self-contained class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
