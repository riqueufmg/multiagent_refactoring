    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 37 methods (nom=37) with 35 of them being public (nopm=35), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=45) is high, suggesting significant implementation complexity. The class serves as a utility class with many static factory methods for creating failable functional interfaces, which represents a large amount of functionality that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The high method count and complexity suggest insufficient modularization as the class could be further decomposed to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
