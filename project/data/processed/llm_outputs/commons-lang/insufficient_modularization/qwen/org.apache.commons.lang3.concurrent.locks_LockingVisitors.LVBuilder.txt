    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks.LockingVisitors.LVBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4), 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), and 75 lines of code (loc=75). The low method count and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple builder class with minimal complexity (wmc=0) and no inheritance depth issues (dit=2). The lack of methods suggests it may be a data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class needing decomposition."
