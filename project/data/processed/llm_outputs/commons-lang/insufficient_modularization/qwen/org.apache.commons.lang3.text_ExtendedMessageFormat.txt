    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.ExtendedMessageFormat",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 59 which is very high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 21 with only 8 fields suggesting poor cohesion, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 364 which is excessive for a single class. The high method count (21) and weighted method complexity (59) indicate the class has not been adequately decomposed into smaller, more manageable components."
