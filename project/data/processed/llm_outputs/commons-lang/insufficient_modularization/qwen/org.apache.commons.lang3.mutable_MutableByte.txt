    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableByte",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 31 methods (nom=31, nopm=31) which indicates a high method count, but the WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 32 which is relatively low for the number of methods. The LCOM value is 0.064516129032258 which is very low, indicating good cohesion. The class has only 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and 274 lines of code (loc=274). While the method count is high, the low cyclomatic complexity and good cohesion suggest the class is reasonably well-structured for its purpose as a mutable byte wrapper. The DIT=1 indicates it's not inheriting complexity from parent classes."
