{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.ConstructorUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with a weighted method count of 17 (wmc=17), indicating moderate complexity. The lines of code (loc=185) are relatively low. The class has no fields (nof=0) and no nested classes (nc=0), suggesting simple structure. While it has dependencies on 3 other classes, this is typical for utility classes in the reflection package. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
