    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods which is a moderate number, and 67 lines of code which is relatively small. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 9, indicating reasonable complexity. With only 1 dependency and no fields (nof=0), the class appears to be reasonably focused and decomposed. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
