    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 39 lines of code (loc=39), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=3) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no dependencies, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
