    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.FormattableUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 87 lines of code (loc=87), which is relatively small. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=8) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class is already well-contained. The low LCOM value (lcom=0.5) suggests good cohesion among methods. The class has no fan-in or fan-out dependencies, indicating it's isolated but not overly complex. These metrics suggest the class is sufficiently modularized."
