    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableObjLongConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0), 1 field (nof=1, nopf=0), low complexity (wmc=2), and 30 lines of code (loc=30). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity and small size, indicates adequate modularization without need for further decomposition."
