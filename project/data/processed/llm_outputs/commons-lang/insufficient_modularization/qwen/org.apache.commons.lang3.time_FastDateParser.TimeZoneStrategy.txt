    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.TimeZoneStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields and 0 methods, with 109 lines of code. While the LOC count is relatively high for the number of fields, the lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) indicates this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring decomposition. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further modularization."
