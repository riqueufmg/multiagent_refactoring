{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks.LockingVisitors.ReadWriteLockVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely an empty or minimal class. With no complexity metrics available (wmc=0, nc=0) and no dependencies, there is insufficient evidence of implementation complexity that would require further decomposition. The low LOC count (52) is not indicative of complexity on its own when the class lacks methods and fields."
