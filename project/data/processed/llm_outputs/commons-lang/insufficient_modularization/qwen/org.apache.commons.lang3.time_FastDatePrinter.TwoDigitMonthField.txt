    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.TwoDigitMonthField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 29 lines of code (loc=29). It also has minimal dependencies with 0 fanin and 0 fanout. The low complexity metrics indicate this class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
