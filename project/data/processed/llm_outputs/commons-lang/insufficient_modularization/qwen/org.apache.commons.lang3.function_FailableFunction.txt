    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 74 lines of code (loc=74), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low implementation complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no dependencies, the class appears to be well-focused and adequately modularized for its functionality."
