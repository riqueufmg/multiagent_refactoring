```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 38 methods (nom=38) and 549 lines of code (loc=549), indicating high size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=56) further confirms high implementation complexity. The class also has 9 fields (nof=9) and depends on 6 external classes, suggesting it has multiple responsibilities including time measurement, state management, and formatting operations. These metrics indicate the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
