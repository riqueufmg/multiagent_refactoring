{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.AppendableJoiner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 12 methods and WMC of 18, but LCOM value of 0.167 indicates good cohesion. The class size of 211 LOC is reasonable for its functionality. The metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to have appropriate internal structure and complexity for its responsibilities."
