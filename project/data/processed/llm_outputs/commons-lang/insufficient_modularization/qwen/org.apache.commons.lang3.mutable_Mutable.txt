{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.Mutable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a small and simple class. With 0 fields (nof=0) and no dependencies, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit complexity that would require further modularization. The low method count and minimal size suggest sufficient modularization has been achieved."
