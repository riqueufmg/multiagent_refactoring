{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.CalendarUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19) with 13 public methods (nopm=13), 164 lines of code (loc=164), and weighted method count of 20 (wmc=20). While the class has moderate complexity, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.1052631578947368) suggests good internal cohesion, and with only 3 fields (nof=3) and 1 public field (nopf=1), the class maintains reasonable modularization. The absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates it's a relatively self-contained utility class with appropriate scope and complexity."
