    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 34 methods (nom), 27 public methods (nopm), 660 lines of code (loc), and a very high weighted method count of 97 (wmc). The large number of methods and high WMC suggest the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
