{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AbstractFutureProxy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7) and 37 lines of code (loc=37), which is relatively small. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (nof=1, nc=2) indicate it is already well modularized. The WMC of 7 matches the number of methods, suggesting each method has single responsibility. LCOM of 0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class."
