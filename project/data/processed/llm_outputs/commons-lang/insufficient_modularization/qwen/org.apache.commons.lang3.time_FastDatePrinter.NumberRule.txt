    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 12 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). It appears to be a simple interface or minimal class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low size and complexity metrics indicate it is already sufficiently decomposed."
