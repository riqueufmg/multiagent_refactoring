    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemProperties",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has excessive size and complexity indicators: 205 methods (nom), 193 public fields (nopf), 2807 lines of code (loc), and WMC of 206. These metrics significantly exceed typical thresholds for well-modularized classes, suggesting the class should be decomposed into smaller, more focused components to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
