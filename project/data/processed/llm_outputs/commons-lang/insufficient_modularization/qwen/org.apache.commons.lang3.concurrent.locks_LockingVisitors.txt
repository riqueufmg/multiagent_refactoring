{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks.LockingVisitors",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 440 lines of code (loc) and contains 8 fields (nof) with 6 methods (nom). It also defines 3 inner classes as dependencies (ReentrantLockVisitor, ReadWriteLockVisitor, StampedLockVisitor), suggesting it is handling multiple locking mechanisms within a single class. The high line count and multiple inner class dependencies indicate the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
