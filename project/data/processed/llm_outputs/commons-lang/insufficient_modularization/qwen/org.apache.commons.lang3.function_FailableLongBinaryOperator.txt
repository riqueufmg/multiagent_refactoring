    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 15 lines of code which indicates minimal complexity and size. There are no dependencies or inheritance relationships (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The class appears to be a simple functional interface with minimal responsibilities that does not warrant further decomposition."
