{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 25 methods (nom=25) with 24 private methods (nopm=24), indicating a high concentration of functionality within a single class. The class contains 421 lines of code (loc=421) and has a Weighted Method Count of 26 (wmc=26), suggesting high implementation complexity. The presence of multiple related functional interfaces (FailableBiFunction, FailableSupplier, FailableConsumer, etc.) as dependencies indicates that this class likely serves as a central hub for various functional programming utilities, which could benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
