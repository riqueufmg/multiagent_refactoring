    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 43 lines of code (loc=43), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=8) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and 1 public method (nopm=2, nopf=1), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, nc=0) further support that this is a properly modularized, focused class."
