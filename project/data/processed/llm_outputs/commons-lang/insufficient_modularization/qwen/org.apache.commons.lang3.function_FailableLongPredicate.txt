    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableLongPredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 65 lines of code (loc=65), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to have a focused responsibility. The lack of dependencies (empty dependencies array) and zero fan-in/fan-out values indicate good isolation. Based on these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains a reasonable size and complexity level."
