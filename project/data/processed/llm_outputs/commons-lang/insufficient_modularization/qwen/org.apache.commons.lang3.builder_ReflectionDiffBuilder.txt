    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionDiffBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) and 165 lines of code (loc=165), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=17) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would require decomposition. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low coupling (lcom=0.25) suggest the class is well-focused. The depth of inheritance (dit=1) shows it's not part of a complex inheritance hierarchy. While the class has some complexity, it does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization that would warrant further decomposition."
