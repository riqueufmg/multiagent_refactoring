{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.AggregateTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 27 lines of code (loc=27), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no static fields (nopf=0), the class maintains simple data structure. The lack of class dependencies (nc=0) and shallow inheritance depth (dit=1) indicate good modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests cohesive design where all methods use the same instance variables."
