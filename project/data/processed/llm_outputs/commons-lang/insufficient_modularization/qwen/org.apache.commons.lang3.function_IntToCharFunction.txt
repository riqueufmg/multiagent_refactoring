    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 13 lines of code (loc=13). It represents a simple functional interface with minimal complexity that does not require further decomposition. The low number of methods and fields indicates sufficient modularization for its purpose."
