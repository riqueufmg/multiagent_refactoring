    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 1 field, 0 methods, and WMC of 0. The LOC is 41 which is relatively small. There are no dependencies or coupling metrics indicating complexity that would require further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, well-encapsulated strategy implementation with minimal responsibilities."
