    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.CircuitBreaker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 36 lines of code (loc=36), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 nested class (nc=1) and no dependencies (dependencies=[]), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
