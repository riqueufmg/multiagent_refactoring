    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.IDKey",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 37 lines of code (loc=37), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=5) indicates low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no class-level dependencies (nc=0, dit=0), this class appears to be appropriately modularized for its simple purpose as a key class for identity comparison."
