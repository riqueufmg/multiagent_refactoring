    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateFormat",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 43 methods (nom), 422 lines of code (loc), and Weighted Methods per Class of 44 (wmc). The class depends on 3 other classes but has 0 fanin and fanout, suggesting it may be doing too much internally rather than properly delegating responsibilities. The combination of high method count, high lines of code, and high WMC suggests this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
