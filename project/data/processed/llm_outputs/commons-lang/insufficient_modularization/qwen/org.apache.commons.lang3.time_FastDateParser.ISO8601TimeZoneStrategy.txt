    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.ISO8601TimeZoneStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 31 lines of code (loc=31). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or configuration class rather than a complex module requiring refactoring."
