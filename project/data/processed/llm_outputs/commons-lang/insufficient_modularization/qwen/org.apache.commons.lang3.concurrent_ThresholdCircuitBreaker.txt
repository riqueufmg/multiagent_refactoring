{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ThresholdCircuitBreaker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5), low lines of code (59), low weighted method count (7), and no class dependencies. The lack of complexity indicators such as high WMC, large LOC, or numerous methods suggests that further decomposition is not necessary. LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion among methods."
