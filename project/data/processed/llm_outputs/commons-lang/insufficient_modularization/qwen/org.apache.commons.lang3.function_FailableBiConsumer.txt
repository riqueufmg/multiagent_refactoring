    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBiConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no dependencies, the class appears to be well-modularized and focused on a single responsibility."
