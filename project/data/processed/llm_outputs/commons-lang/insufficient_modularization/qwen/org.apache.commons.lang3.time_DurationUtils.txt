```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17) with 14 public methods (nopm=14), high Weighted Method Count (wmc=25), and 170 lines of code (loc=170). The high number of methods and complexity metrics indicate that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity. The class also has multiple dependencies (6 external dependencies) which suggests it handles various responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
