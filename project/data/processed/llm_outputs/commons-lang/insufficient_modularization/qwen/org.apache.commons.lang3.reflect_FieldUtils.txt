{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.FieldUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 36 methods (nom=36) with 35 being public (nopm=35), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The Weighted Method Count is 48 (wmc=48) and Lines of Code is 584 (loc=584), suggesting high implementation complexity. The class manages field reflection operations but could be further decomposed into specialized components for different aspects of field manipulation, such as field retrieval, field modification, and field validation. The high method count and complexity indicate insufficient modularization as the class handles too many related but distinct responsibilities in a single unit."
