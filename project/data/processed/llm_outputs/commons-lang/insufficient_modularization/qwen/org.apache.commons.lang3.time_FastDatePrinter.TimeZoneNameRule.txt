    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.TimeZoneNameRule",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with 35 lines of code. The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or rule container with no complex behavior that would benefit from additional modularization."
