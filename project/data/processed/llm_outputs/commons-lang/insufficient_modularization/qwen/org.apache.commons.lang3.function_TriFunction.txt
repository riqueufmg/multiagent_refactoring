    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), with very low complexity metrics. The LOC is 30 which is minimal for a functional interface. The class represents a simple functional interface with no implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
