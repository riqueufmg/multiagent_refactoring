    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Validate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 54 methods (nom=54) with a high weighted method count (wmc=92), indicating high complexity. The large number of methods suggests the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high LCOM value (0.925925925925926) indicates poor cohesion, meaning the methods are not closely related to each other, which is a strong indicator that the class should be split into multiple cohesive modules. With 797 lines of code (loc=797), the class is also quite large and could be further decomposed to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
