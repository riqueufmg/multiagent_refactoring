    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.CharSequenceTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods with a WMC of 13, indicating moderate complexity. With only 91 lines of code and 8 nested classes, the class is relatively small and manageable. The LCOM value of 0.667 suggests reasonable cohesion. The low number of methods and moderate complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
