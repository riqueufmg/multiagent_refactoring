    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Conversion",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 43 methods (nom=43) and 1110 lines of code (loc=1110), indicating it is large and potentially complex. The high weighted method count (wmc=245) suggests significant implementation complexity. With 16 fields (nof=16) and no private fields (nopf=0), the class manages substantial state. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low cohesion (lcom=0.6744186046511628, closer to 1 than 0) further indicate insufficient modularization where the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more cohesive units."
