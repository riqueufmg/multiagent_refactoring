{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 40 lines of code (loc=40), which indicates a small and focused class. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. The class appears to be a simple exception class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and fields (nof=1, nopf=0) suggests it is already well-modularized and serves a single, specific purpose."
