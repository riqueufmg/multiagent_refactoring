{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.NotImplementedException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 methods (nom=8, wmc=8) and 81 lines of code (loc=81), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. With 2 fields (nof=2) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to be well-contained and focused on a single responsibility. The LCOM value of 0.5 suggests reasonable cohesion within the class. Given its small size and low complexity, further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
