    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.NumericEntityUnescaper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with all being public (nopm=3), indicating proper decomposition. The weighted method count (wmc=13) is reasonable for the number of methods. The lines of code (loc=95) is relatively small, and the lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests focused responsibility. The depth of inheritance (dit=1) indicates it's a base class, and the low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0) suggests methods are well-related."
