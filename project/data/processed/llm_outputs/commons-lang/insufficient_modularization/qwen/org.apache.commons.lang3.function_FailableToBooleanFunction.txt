    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableToBooleanFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is also very low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0), this class appears to be appropriately modularized for its simple functionality as a functional interface."
