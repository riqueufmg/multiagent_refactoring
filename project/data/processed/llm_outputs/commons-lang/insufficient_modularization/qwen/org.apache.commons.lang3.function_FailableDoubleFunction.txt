    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableDoubleFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 1 field (nof=1), with a very low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=2). The class is small in terms of lines of code (loc=28) and has no dependencies or inheritance. This indicates proper modularization for a simple functional interface class that represents a failable double function transformation."
