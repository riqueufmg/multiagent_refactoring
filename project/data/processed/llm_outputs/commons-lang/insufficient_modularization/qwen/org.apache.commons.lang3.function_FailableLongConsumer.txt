    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableLongConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 41 lines of code (loc=41), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and focused on a single responsibility. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
