{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableFloat",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 32 methods (nom=32) which is relatively high, but the lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1), and low lines of code (loc=280) suggest it's a focused utility class. The low LCOM value (0.0625) indicates good cohesion among methods, and the WMC equals the number of methods suggesting simple method complexity. This appears to be a well-contained mutable wrapper class with appropriate size and complexity for its purpose."
