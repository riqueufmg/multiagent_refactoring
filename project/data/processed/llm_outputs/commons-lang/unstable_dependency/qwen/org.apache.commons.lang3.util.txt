"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.lang3.util has stability of 1.0 (Ce=1, Ca=0), while its dependency org.apache.commons.lang3 has stability of 0.435 (Ce=10, Ca=13). Since the dependent package (org.apache.commons.lang3) is less stable than the depending package (org.apache.commons.lang3.util), this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. The more stable package (org.apache.commons.lang3.util) depends on a less stable package, which is the correct direction according to the principle."
