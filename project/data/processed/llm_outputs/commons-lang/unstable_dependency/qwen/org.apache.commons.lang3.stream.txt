"package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.stream",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.lang3.stream has outgoing dependencies on org.apache.commons.lang3.function and org.apache.commons.lang3. To determine stability, we calculate the instability metric (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) for each involved package. For org.apache.commons.lang3.stream: I = 2 / (2 + 2) = 0.5. For org.apache.commons.lang3.function: I = 2 / (7 + 2) = 0.22. For org.apache.commons.lang3: I = 10 / (13 + 10) = 0.43. Since org.apache.commons.lang3.stream (I=0.5) depends on packages that are more stable (lower instability) such as org.apache.commons.lang3.function (I=0.22) and org.apache.commons.lang3 (I=0.43), it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
