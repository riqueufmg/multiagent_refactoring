{
"package": "org.apache.commons.lang3",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.apache.commons.lang3' has outgoing dependencies to several sub-packages. To determine if it has an Unstable Dependency smell, we need to compare its stability (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) with the stability of its dependencies. 'org.apache.commons.lang3' has Ce=10 and Ca=13, so I=10/(10+13)=0.43. All of its outgoing dependencies have lower Ce and often similar or lower Ca, indicating they are more stable or equally stable. For example, 'org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable' has Ce=1, Ca=3, I=0.25; 'org.apache.commons.lang3.math' has Ce=1, Ca=3, I=0.25; 'org.apache.commons.lang3.arch' has Ce=0, Ca=1, I=0. Therefore, 'org.apache.commons.lang3' depends on packages that are as stable or more stable than itself, adhering to the Stable Dependencies Principle."
