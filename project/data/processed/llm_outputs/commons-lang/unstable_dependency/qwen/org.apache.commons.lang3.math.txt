"package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.math",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.lang3.math has outgoing dependencies only to org.apache.commons.lang3, which is more stable due to its larger size (73 classes, 26295 LOC) and higher afferent couplings (Ca=13) indicating greater usage by other packages. The stability metric (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)) shows org.apache.commons.lang3 is more stable (I=10/(13+10)=0.43) compared to org.apache.commons.lang3.math (I=1/(3+1)=0.25), thus the dependency direction aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle."
