"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.lang3.exception has a stability (I) of 0.17 (Ce=1, Ca=5, I=Ce/(Ce+Ca)), making it unstable. It depends on org.apache.commons.lang3 which has a stability (I) of 0.43 (Ce=10, Ca=13, I=Ce/(Ce+Ca)), making it more stable. Since the dependency is directed from a less stable package to a more stable one, it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
