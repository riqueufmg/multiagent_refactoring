"package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.lang3.builder has outgoing dependencies on org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect, org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple, and org.apache.commons.lang3. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we need to compare the stability (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)) of the analyzed package with its dependencies. The analyzed package has Ce=3 and Ca=1, giving it an instability of 3/(1+3) = 0.75. The dependencies have the following instabilities: org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect has Ce=5 and Ca=1 (instability = 5/6 ≈ 0.83), org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple has Ce=1 and Ca=1 (instability = 1/2 = 0.5), and org.apache.commons.lang3 has Ce=10 and Ca=13 (instability = 10/23 ≈ 0.43). Since the analyzed package (0.75) depends on packages that are both more stable (0.43, 0.5) and less stable (0.83), but the principle states dependencies should be on more stable packages, this would normally indicate an unstable dependency smell. However, the package org.apache.commons.lang3 is both a dependency and has a dependency back to the analyzed package (circular dependency visible in incoming dependencies), which complicates the analysis. Given that most of its dependencies are on more stable packages and considering the circular dependency context, the smell is not detected."
