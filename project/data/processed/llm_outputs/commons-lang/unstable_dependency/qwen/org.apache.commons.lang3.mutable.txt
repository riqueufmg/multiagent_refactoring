"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable has a stability of 0.1 (Ce=1, Ca=3), while its outgoing dependency org.apache.commons.lang3 has a stability of 0.43 (Ce=10, Ca=13). Since the mutable package depends on a more stable package, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. The incoming dependencies from less stable packages like org.apache.commons.lang3.text (stability=0.67) and org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect (stability=0.83) do not constitute unstable dependencies because the direction of dependency is towards the mutable package, not from it."
