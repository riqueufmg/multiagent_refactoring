"package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.arch",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.lang3.arch has no outgoing dependencies (Ce=0), so it cannot have unstable dependencies. While it is depended upon by org.apache.commons.lang3 which is much larger and more complex (73 classes, 26295 loc, Ce=10, Ca=13), this does not create an unstable dependency smell for arch since arch itself doesn't depend on anything. The stability metric I for arch is 1.0 (completely stable) since Ce=0, making it a stable component that others can safely depend on."
