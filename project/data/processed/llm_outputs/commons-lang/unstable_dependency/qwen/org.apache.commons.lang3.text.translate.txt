"package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate",

"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate has a stability value of 0.09 (Ce=1, Ca=1, stability=Ce/(Ce+Ca)=1/11≈0.09). It depends on org.apache.commons.lang3 which has a stability value of 0.43 (Ce=10, Ca=13, stability=10/23≈0.43). Since the analyzed package is less stable than the package it depends on (0.09 < 0.43), it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
