"package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect' has a stability value of 0.83 (Ce=5, Ca=1, stability=Ce/(Ce+Ca)=5/6≈0.83). Its outgoing dependencies are to packages with stability values: org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable (0.25), org.apache.commons.lang3.math (0.25), org.apache.commons.lang3.stream (0.33), org.apache.commons.lang3.compare (0.0), and org.apache.commons.lang3 (0.43). All these dependencies are to packages that are more stable than itself (lower stability values), which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
