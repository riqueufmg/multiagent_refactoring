"package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks has outgoing dependencies to org.apache.commons.lang3.function and org.apache.commons.lang3. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we need to calculate stability values. Stability is calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) where Ce is efferent couplings (outgoing dependencies) and Ca is afferent couplings (incoming dependencies). For org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks: Ce=2, Ca=0, so stability=2/(0+2)=1.0 (completely unstable). For org.apache.commons.lang3.function: Ce=2, Ca=7, stability=2/(7+2)=0.22. For org.apache.commons.lang3: Ce=10, Ca=13, stability=10/(13+10)=0.43. Since the analyzed package (stability=1.0) depends on packages that are more stable (0.22 and 0.43), it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
