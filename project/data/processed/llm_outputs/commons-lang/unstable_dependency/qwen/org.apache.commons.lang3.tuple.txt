"package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple has a stability index of 0.5 (Ce=1, Ca=1), while its outgoing dependency org.apache.commons.lang3.function has a stability index of 0.71 (Ce=2, Ca=7). Since the tuple package depends on a more stable package (0.71 > 0.5), this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not constitute an Unstable Dependency smell."
