"package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent' has outgoing dependencies on 'org.apache.commons.lang3', 'org.apache.commons.lang3.exception', and 'org.apache.commons.lang3.function'. To evaluate stability, we compare the instability (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) of the analyzed package with its dependencies. The analyzed package has Ce=3 and Ca=0, so its instability is I=1.0 (maximally unstable). The dependencies have the following instabilities: 'org.apache.commons.lang3' (Ce=10, Ca=13) => I=0.43, 'org.apache.commons.lang3.exception' (Ce=1, Ca=5) => I=0.17, and 'org.apache.commons.lang3.function' (Ce=2, Ca=7) => I=0.22. Since the analyzed package (I=1.0) depends only on packages that are more stable (lower instability values), it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
