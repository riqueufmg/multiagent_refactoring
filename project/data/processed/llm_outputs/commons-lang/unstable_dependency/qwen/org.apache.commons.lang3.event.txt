"package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.event",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.apache.commons.lang3.event' has outgoing dependencies to 'org.apache.commons.lang3.exception' and 'org.apache.commons.lang3.function'. To evaluate stability, we calculate I = Ca / (Ca + Ce) for each package. For 'org.apache.commons.lang3.event': I = 0 / (0 + 2) = 0 (maximally stable). For 'org.apache.commons.lang3.exception': I = 5 / (5 + 1) = 0.83. For 'org.apache.commons.lang3.function': I = 7 / (7 + 2) = 0.78. Since the analyzed package is maximally stable (I = 0) and depends on packages that are less stable (I > 0), this does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Stable packages can depend on less stable packages without creating an unstable dependency smell."
