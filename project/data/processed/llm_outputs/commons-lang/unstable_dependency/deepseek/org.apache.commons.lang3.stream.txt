  "justification": "The package has instability (I) = 0.5, calculated as Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 2/(2+2). Its outgoing dependencies are to packages with lower instability values: 'org.apache.commons.lang3' (I ≈ 0.4348) and 'org.apache.commons.lang3.function' (I ≈ 0.2222). Since the package depends only on packages that are more stable (lower I), the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated."
