Its outgoing dependencies are org.apache.commons.lang3.function (Ca=7, Ce=2, I≈0.778) and org.apache.commons.lang3.exception (Ca=5, Ce=1, I≈0.833). Both dependencies are more stable than the analyzed package (0.778 and 0.833 > 0.000), so the package does not depend on less stable components and no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
