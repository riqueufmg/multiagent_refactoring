"justification": "Analyzed package has Ce=1 and Ca=1 (Instability I = 1/(1+1) = 0.5). Its single outgoing dependency is org.apache.commons.lang3 (Ce=10, Ca=13, I = 13/(13+10) ≈ 0.565), which is slightly more stable than the analyzed package. Because the analyzed package depends only on a more stable package, it does not depend on a less stable component, so the Unstable Dependency smell is not present for this package. (Note: there is a mutual dependency — org.apache.commons.lang3 also depends on this package — which means a more stable package depends on a less stable one, but that is a violation relative to org.apache.commons.lang3 rather than this analyzed package.)"
