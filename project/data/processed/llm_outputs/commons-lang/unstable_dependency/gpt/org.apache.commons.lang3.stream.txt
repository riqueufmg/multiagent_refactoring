"justification": "Analyzed package org.apache.commons.lang3.stream has Ce=2, Ca=2 -> instability I = 2/(2+2) = 0.50. Its outgoing dependencies are: org.apache.commons.lang3.function (Ce=2, Ca=7 -> I = 2/(2+7) ≈ 0.22) and org.apache.commons.lang3 (Ce=10, Ca=13 -> I = 10/(10+13) ≈ 0.43). Both outgoing dependencies have lower instability than the analyzed package (they are more stable), so the package does not depend on less stable components. Incoming dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect Ce=5, Ca=1 -> I ≈ 0.83; org.apache.commons.lang3 I ≈ 0.43) do not change this assessment. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
