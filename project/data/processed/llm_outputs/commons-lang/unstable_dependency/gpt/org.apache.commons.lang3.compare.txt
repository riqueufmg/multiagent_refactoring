"justification": "org.apache.commons.lang3.compare has Ce=0 (no outgoing dependencies) and Ca=1, giving stability I=1.0. It does not depend on any other packages, so it cannot depend on less-stable packages. The only incoming dependency is from org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect (Ce=5, Ca=1, I≈0.1667), which depends on this package — that is the correct direction (less stable package depending on more stable one). Therefore no Unstable Dependency is detected for org.apache.commons.lang3.compare."
