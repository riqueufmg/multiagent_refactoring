"justification": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder has Ca=1, Ce=3 => stability I = 1/(1+3) = 0.25. It has outgoing dependencies to: org.apache.commons.lang3 (Ca=13, Ce=10 => I = 13/23 ≈ 0.565), org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect (Ca=1, Ce=5 => I = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667), and org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple (Ca=1, Ce=1 => I = 0.5). Because it depends on org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect which is less stable (I ≈ 0.1667) than org.apache.commons.lang3.builder (I = 0.25), the Stable Dependencies Principle is violated (package depends on a less stable package) -> Unstable Dependency detected."
