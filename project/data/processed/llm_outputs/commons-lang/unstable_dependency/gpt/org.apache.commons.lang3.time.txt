"justification": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time has Ce=4 and Ca=1 -> stability I = 1/(1+4) = 0.20 (unstable). Its outgoing dependencies have higher stability: org.apache.commons.lang3.function I = 7/(7+2) = 0.78, org.apache.commons.lang3 I = 13/(13+10) = 0.565, org.apache.commons.lang3.exception I = 5/(5+1) = 0.83, org.apache.commons.lang3.math I = 3/(3+1) = 0.75. All outgoing dependencies are more stable than org.apache.commons.lang3.time, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
