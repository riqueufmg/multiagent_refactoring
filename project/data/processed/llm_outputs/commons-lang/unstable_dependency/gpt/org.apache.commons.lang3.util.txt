"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=1, Ca=0 (stability I = 0/(0+1) = 0). Outgoing dependency: org.apache.commons.lang3 (Ce=10, Ca=13, stability I = 13/(13+10) ≈ 0.565). Incoming dependencies: none. Because org.apache.commons.lang3.util depends only on org.apache.commons.lang3 which is more stable (higher stability index) than org.apache.commons.lang3.util, the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated and there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
