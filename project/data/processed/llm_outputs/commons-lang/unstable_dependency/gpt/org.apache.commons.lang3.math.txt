"package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.math",
"detection": true,
"justification": "org.apache.commons.lang3.math has Ce=1 and Ca=3 (instability I = 3/(3+1) = 0.75), and its sole outgoing dependency is org.apache.commons.lang3 which has Ce=10 and Ca=13 (instability I = 13/(13+10) ≈ 0.565). Because org.apache.commons.lang3.math is more stable (higher I) yet depends on a less stable package (lower I), this violates the Stable Dependencies Principle and constitutes an Unstable Dependency. The dependency relationship is explicit in the outgoing dependencies (depends on org.apache.commons.lang3). Incoming dependencies (org.apache.commons.lang3.time and org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect) further show usage by relatively unstable packages, but the primary smell is that the analyzed package depends on a less stable package (org.apache.commons.lang3)."
