"justification": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable has Ce=1 and Ca=3 (stability I = 3/(3+1) = 0.75). It has an outgoing dependency to org.apache.commons.lang3 which has Ce=10 and Ca=13 (stability I = 13/(13+10) ≈ 0.565). Because org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable depends on org.apache.commons.lang3 whose stability (≈0.565) is lower than its own (0.75), this violates the Stable Dependencies Principle and indicates an Unstable Dependency smell."
