It has an outgoing dependency to org.apache.commons.lang3 which has Ce=10 and Ca=13 -> stability = 13/(13+10) = 0.5652. Because the analyzed package (stability 0.8333) depends on a less stable package (stability 0.5652), the Stable Dependencies Principle is violated -> Unstable Dependency detected."
