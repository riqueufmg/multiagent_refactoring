"package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.arch",

"justification": "The package has Ce=0 (no outgoing/efferent dependencies) and Ca=1 (one incoming), giving instability I = 0/(0+1) = 0 (fully stable). There are no outgoing dependencies to less-stable packages; the only relation is an incoming dependency from org.apache.commons.lang3. Therefore the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated and Unstable Dependency is not detected."
