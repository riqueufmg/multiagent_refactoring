"justification": "org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple has Ce=1 and Ca=1 (instability I = 1/(1+1) = 0.50). Its only outgoing dependency is org.apache.commons.lang3.function which has Ce=2 and Ca=7 (I = 2/(2+7) ≈ 0.22), so tuple depends on a more stable package — this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. Incoming dependency org.apache.commons.lang3.builder (Ce=3, Ca=1, I=0.75) depends on tuple, but incoming unstable dependents do not make tuple violate the principle. Therefore no Unstable Dependency is detected."
