Outgoing dependencies: 1) org.apache.commons.lang3.function: Ce=2, Ca=7 -> I = 2/(7+2) = 0.222; 2) org.apache.commons.lang3: Ce=10, Ca=13 -> I = 10/(13+10) = 0.435. Both outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than the analyzed package. Incoming dependencies: none (Ca=0). Because the package depends only on more stable packages (lower I values), the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
