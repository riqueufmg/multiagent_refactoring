It depends on org.apache.commons.lang3.exception (Ca=5, Ce=1, stability = 0.833) and org.apache.commons.lang3 (Ca=13, Ce=10, stability = 0.565). Because org.apache.commons.lang3.function depends on org.apache.commons.lang3 whose stability (0.565) is lower than the analyzed package (0.778), the Stable Dependencies Principle is violated (depends on a less stable package)."
