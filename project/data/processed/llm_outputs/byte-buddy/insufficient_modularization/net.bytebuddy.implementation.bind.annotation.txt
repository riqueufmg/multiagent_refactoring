It also exposes/contains many nested roles (FieldResolver, Factory, Duplex/Simplex, ForGetter/ForSetter, StaticFieldConstructor, InstanceFieldConstructor, AccessorProxy, multiple Appender/MethodCall variants) and depends on a wide variety of unrelated subsystems (dynamic type generation, bytecode manipulation, method/field descriptions, assigner, auxiliary proxies, etc.), indicating concentrated, diverse responsibilities and a bloated interface that would benefit from decomposition into smaller, cohesive abstractions."

Metrics and dependency scope indicate a single, cohesive responsibility rather than a bloated abstraction."
