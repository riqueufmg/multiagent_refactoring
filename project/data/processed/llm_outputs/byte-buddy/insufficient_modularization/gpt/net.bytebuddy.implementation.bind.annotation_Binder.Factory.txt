    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: LOC=87 (moderate size), WMC=0 and NOM=0 (no measured method complexity or many methods to split), NOF=5 (small number of fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), and only three external dependencies. There is no evidence of high complexity, large size, or high coupling that would justify 'Insufficient Modularization'."
