    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc = 37), very low field count (nof = 2) and no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) so there is nothing to further decompose; zero complexity (wmc = 0) and no measured coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and LCOM = -1.0 provide no evidence of a large, complex, or multifaceted class that would benefit from additional decomposition."
