    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 137) while showing no methods (nom = 0) and only two fields (nof = 2). Coupled with zero weighted method count (wmc = 0) and an indeterminate/negative cohesion indicator (lcom = -1.0), these metrics indicate a mismatch between class size and modular structure: substantial implementation exists but is not decomposed into methods or smaller collaborating units. Given these facts (loc=137, nom=0, nof=2, wmc=0, lcom=-1.0) further decomposition is likely to reduce size and implementation complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is detected."
