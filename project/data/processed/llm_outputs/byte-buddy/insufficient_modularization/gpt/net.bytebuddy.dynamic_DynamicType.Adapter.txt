    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Adapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 1214) and a high number of features (nof = 54) indicating it contains many responsibilities that could be split. It depends on a wide range of unrelated areas (33 distinct dependencies across attribute appenders, scaffolding, descriptions, implementation and ASM utilities), suggesting multiple concerns are mixed. Given these metrics in isolation (large LOC, high feature count, many diverse dependencies), further decomposition into smaller, more focused modules/classes is warranted."
