    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=52, wmc=1, nom=1, nof=1. It has no inheritance (dit=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two listed dependencies. Cohesion metric does not indicate a decomposition need (lcom=-1.0). Given the low size, low complexity, minimal members and low coupling, there is no evidence that this class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
