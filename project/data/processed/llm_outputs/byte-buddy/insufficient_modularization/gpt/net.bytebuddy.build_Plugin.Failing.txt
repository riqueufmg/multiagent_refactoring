    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Failing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no internal structure to decompose: nom=0 (no methods), nof=0/nopf=0 (no fields), and wmc=0 (no measured complexity). Fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate no coupling that would suggest responsibility bloat. Although LOC=96 is non‑zero, it is not accompanied by methods or complexity metrics that would indicate a single large, undecomposed implementation. LCOM=-1.0 appears to be an invalid/uncomputed value and cannot be used to justify insufficient modularization. Given the absence of methods/fields and complexity, there is no evidence in the provided metrics that the class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
