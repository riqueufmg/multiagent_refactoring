    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and lacks internal complexity that would indicate incomplete decomposition: LOC=22, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1, DIT=1, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods to refactor or split and coupling/cohesion metrics do not suggest internal complexity or low cohesion, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
