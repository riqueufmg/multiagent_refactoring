    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.SuperMethodCall.WithoutReturn",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No evidence of Insufficient Modularization: the class is small (loc=19), has no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0), indicating little internal implementation to decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=1 and LCOM=-1.0 do not indicate a need for further decomposition in isolation. Therefore there is no justification, from the provided metrics and dependencies, to flag insufficient modularization."
