    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is small (39), there are zero methods and zero fields (nom=0, nof=0), WMC=0 indicating no internal complexity, fanin and fanout are 0 showing no coupling pressure, and only one dependency (TypeList). LCOM value is not meaningful here. There is no evidence the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
