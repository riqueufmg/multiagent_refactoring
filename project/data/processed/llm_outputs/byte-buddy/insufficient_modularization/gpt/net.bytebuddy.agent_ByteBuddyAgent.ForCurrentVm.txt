    "justification": "No evidence of Insufficient Modularization in the provided metrics: LOC is 98 (moderate size), number of methods (nom) = 0 and WMC = 0 (no measured method complexity), number of fields (nof) = 3 (small state), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no coupling/dependencies). LCOM is -1.0 (metric unavailable), so cohesion cannot be assessed, but the available measures show low size and low complexity. Given the class-only data, there is insufficient indication that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
