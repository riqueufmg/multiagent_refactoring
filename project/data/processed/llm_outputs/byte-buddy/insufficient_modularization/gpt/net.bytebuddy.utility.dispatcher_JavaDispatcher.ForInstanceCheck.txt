    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: loc=31, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), nof=1 (single field), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), and only one external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
