    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=46), no behavioral complexity (nom=0, wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two listed dependencies. There is no evidence of many methods, high complexity, or high coupling that would justify further decomposition; LCOM value is non-informative given nom=0. Therefore, do not detect Insufficient Modularization."
