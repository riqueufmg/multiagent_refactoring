    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.ForClassFileApi",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit insufficient modularization: loc=78 (small), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods and no cyclomatic complexity), nof=2 (few fields), dit=1, lcom=-1.0, fanin=0 and fanout=0, and only two dependencies. In isolation these metrics show low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
