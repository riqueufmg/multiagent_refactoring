    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: it contains a large number of fields (nof = 12) and a substantial size (loc = 261) while depending on a wide variety of unrelated types (dependencies include FieldDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, TypeList, Assigner, StackManipulation, JavaConstant, AnnotationDescription, FieldLocator, etc.). This combination of many fields, significant LOC and diverse dependencies suggests multiple responsibilities and cross-cutting concerns that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or helpers to reduce size and complexity."
