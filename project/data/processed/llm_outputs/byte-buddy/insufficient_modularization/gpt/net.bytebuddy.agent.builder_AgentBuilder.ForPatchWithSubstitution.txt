    "justification": "The class is very small and non-complex: LOC=33, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, NOPF=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only two declared dependencies. Given the low size and absence of methods/complexity, there is no indication that further decomposition is required."
