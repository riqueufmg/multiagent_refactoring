    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.Compiled",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large implementation size (loc = 142) combined with a relatively high number of fields (nof = 12) indicates the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be split. The class shows zero counted methods (nom = 0) despite substantial LOC, suggesting logic is concentrated in fewer structural elements (initializers/anonymous blocks/large methods not captured) rather than decomposed into smaller methods. The class depends on many distinct collaborators (net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter), which suggests multiple concerns are handled within this single class. The cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) is not indicating strong cohesion. These elements together justify that the class exhibits Insufficient Modularization and would likely benefit from further decomposition."
