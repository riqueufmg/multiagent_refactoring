    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: moderate size (loc=95) with very low structural complexity (wmc=0, nom=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), few fields (nof=3) and no significant cohesion issues (lcom=-1.0). Only a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) is listed. Given these values and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
