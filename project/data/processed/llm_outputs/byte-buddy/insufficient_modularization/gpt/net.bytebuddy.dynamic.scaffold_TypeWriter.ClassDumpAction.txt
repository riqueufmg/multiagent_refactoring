    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has substantial size (loc=114) while exposing 8 fields (nof=8) but no declared methods (nom=0, nopm=0). A large LOC with zero methods and wmc=0 suggests functionality or complexity is not split into methods or smaller classes. Fanin=0 and fanout=0 show little modular interaction, and the cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not indicate clear internal modular structure. These indicators together point to Insufficient Modularization: the class appears not fully decomposed and could be split to reduce size and complexity."
