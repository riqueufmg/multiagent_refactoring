    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.OfPrimitiveArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=60 (small), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods/complexity to decompose), fields=2 (few fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issue reported). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
