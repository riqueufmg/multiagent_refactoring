    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ParameterTypeRegistrant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: very small (loc=11), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no cohesion concerns reported (lcom=-1.0). Single declared dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) does not indicate internal size or complexity that would require further decomposition. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class needs further modularization."
