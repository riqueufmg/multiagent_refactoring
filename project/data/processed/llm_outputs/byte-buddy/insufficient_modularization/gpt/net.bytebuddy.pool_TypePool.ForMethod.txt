    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 90 (moderate size), number of fields = 4, number of methods = 0, WMC = 0, fan-in = 0, fan-out = 0, and only three external dependencies. The absence of methods and very low complexity metrics indicate there is no large, monolithic implementation to decompose further."
