    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.MethodBinding",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 174 LOC but defines 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 10 fields (nof=10), indicating substantial size without decomposition into operations. The combination of high LOC with no methods and nontrivial field count suggests responsibilities/data that could be split into smaller classes. DIT=1 (shallow hierarchy) offers no indication decomposition is achieved via inheritance. LCOM=-1.0 is not informative but the other metrics (loc, nof, nom) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized. Dependencies on multiple external types (StackManipulation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation, MethodDescription) further imply multiple concerns that could be separated."
