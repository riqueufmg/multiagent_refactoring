    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: small size (loc = 58), no methods (nom = 0) and zero complexity (wmc = 0) mean there is no substantial implementation to split; limited coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only three external dependencies also argue against modularization. The presence of fields (nof = 5) without behavioral complexity suggests a simple data/holder role rather than an under-decomposed class."
