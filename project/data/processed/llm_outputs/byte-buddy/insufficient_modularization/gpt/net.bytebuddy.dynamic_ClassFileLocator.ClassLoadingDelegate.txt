    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ClassLoadingDelegate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 292) indicating high implementation volume, a relatively high number of fields (nof = 9) suggesting multiple responsibilities or state clusters, and multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy) implying mixed concerns. Additionally, the metrics show zero declared methods (nom = 0) despite the large LOC, which often indicates long initializers or monolithic blocks that could be split into smaller, focused classes or helper components. These elements together justify that the class should be further decomposed."
