    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undersized or monolithic class: LOC is 70 (moderate size), WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPF=0, NOPM=0 and fanin/fanout are 0, showing no concentrated complexity or many responsibilities. Dependencies are limited to two types (TypeList, TypeDefinition). LCOM is -1.0 (no evidence of low cohesion). Given the low complexity, absence of many methods/fields, and minimal external coupling, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
