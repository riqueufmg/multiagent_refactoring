        "No evidence of insufficient modularization: small size (loc = 34) and no methods (nom = 0) indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition. Complexity metrics are zero (wmc = 0), coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and there are no dependencies listed. LCOM = -1.0 provides no indication of poor cohesion. Therefore, there is no justification from the provided metrics to flag Insufficient Modularization."
