    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=29, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), single field (nof=1), very low complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). The limited size, absence of internal complexity, and minimal dependencies indicate no need for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
