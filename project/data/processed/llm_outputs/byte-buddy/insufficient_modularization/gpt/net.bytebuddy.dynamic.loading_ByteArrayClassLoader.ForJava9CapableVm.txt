    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=30, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods or measured complexity to suggest multiple responsibilities or a need for further decomposition. No dependency or coupling indicators point to excessive internal size or complexity. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
