    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForEnumerationDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 247) while containing a moderate number of fields (nof = 7) and no reported methods (nom = 0). The combination of high LOC with few methods suggests bundled implementation content that has not been decomposed into smaller units. Its dependencies span multiple distinct types (TypeDescription, MethodDescription, EnumerationDescription, AnnotationValue), indicating it interacts with varied concerns. These facts (high LOC, multiple fields, zero methods, and diverse dependencies) justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
