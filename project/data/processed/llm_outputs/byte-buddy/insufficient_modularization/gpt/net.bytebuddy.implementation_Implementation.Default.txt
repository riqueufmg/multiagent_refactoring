    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 792) and a high number of fields (nof = 33) indicating substantial internal state and likely multiple responsibilities. It also depends on a broad and diverse set of components (dependencies include TypeInitializer, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, AnnotationValueFilter, TypeList, StackManipulation, ByteCodeAppender, AuxiliaryType, MethodReturn, TypeDescription, TypeWriter, etc.), showing wide coupling to different concerns (bytecode generation, type/annotation descriptions, scaffolding and writing). Taken in isolation, these metrics and the dependency breadth suggest the class is not decomposed enough and would benefit from further modularization."
