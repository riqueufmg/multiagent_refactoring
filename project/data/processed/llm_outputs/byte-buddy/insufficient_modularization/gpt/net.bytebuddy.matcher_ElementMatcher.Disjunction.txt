    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being overly large or complex: LOC=57, NOM=0, NOF=1, WMC=0. Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no methods to indicate concentrated behavior that should be split. Given these metrics and the absence of internal complexity, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
