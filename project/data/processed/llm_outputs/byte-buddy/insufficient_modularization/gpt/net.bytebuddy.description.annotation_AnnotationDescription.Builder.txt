    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription.Builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modular: it has a very large size (loc = 390) while showing no method decomposition (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and no measured complexity (wmc = 0). Despite low cohesion/complexity metric values (lcom = -1.0, which is uninformative) and zero fanin/fanout, the class depends on many distinct types (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.enumeration.EnumerationDescription), indicating it handles multiple responsibilities. The combination of large LOC and multiple external dependencies with no apparent method-level decomposition justifies flagging Insufficient Modularization: the class should be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
