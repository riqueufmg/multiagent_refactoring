    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.ForEmulatedAttachment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Provided metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class is small and lacks internal complexity: LOC=18, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine). Given zero methods/fields and low LOC, there is no evidence in the supplied data that the class should be further decomposed."
