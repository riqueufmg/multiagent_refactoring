    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.FieldComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=22, number of methods=1 (nom=1), WMC=3 (low complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already simple and focused, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
