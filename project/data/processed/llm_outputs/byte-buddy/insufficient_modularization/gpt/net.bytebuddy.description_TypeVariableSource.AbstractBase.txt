    "justification": "The class shows no indicators of insufficient modularization when considered in isolation: LOC=33 (small), NOF=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0 (no fields or methods to split), WMC=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), NC=0, DIT=1, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. Dependencies are limited (TypeDescription, ModifierReviewable, TypeList) but there is no internal size or complexity (methods/fields) that would justify further decomposition."
