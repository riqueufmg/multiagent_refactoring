    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.InstanceFieldConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: LOC is small (51), WMC is 0 and there are no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (dit=1). These metrics indicate the class is small and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
