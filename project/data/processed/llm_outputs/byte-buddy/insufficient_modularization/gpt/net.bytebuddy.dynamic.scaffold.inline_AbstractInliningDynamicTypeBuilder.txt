    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=48, NOM=2, NOF=2, WMC=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=0). There are no incoming/outgoing coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate low size and low complexity so further decomposition is not warranted; presence of multiple external dependencies alone does not imply insufficient modularization."
