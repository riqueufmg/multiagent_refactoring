    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: very small size (loc=34), no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0), minimal state (nof=3), and no coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is simple and does not require further decomposition."
