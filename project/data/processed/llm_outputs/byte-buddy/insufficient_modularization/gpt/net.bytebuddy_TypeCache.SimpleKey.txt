    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: loc=48, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0. Low coupling and impact: fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=0. lcom=-1.0 with nom=0 implies cohesion metrics are not showing fragmentation. Only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin). There is no evidence from the provided metrics that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
