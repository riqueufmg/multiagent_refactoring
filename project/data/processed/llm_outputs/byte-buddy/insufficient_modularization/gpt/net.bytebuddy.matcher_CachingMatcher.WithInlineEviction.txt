    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=31, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1, DIT=1, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods to decompose (NOM=0), minimal state (NOF=1) and no coupling to other classes, so there is no evidence that further modularization (decomposition) is needed."
