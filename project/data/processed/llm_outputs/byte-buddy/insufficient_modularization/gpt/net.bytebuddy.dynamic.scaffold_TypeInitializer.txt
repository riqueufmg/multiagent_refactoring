    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 139 LOC but only 3 methods (nom = 3), implying an average of ~46 lines per method which indicates large methods that could be further decomposed. WMC is low (3) but cyclomatic complexity does not capture method size; the high LOC concentrated in few methods suggests insufficient modularization. There are 4 fields and no external dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), indicating substantial internal implementation that could be split into smaller, focused methods or helper classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
