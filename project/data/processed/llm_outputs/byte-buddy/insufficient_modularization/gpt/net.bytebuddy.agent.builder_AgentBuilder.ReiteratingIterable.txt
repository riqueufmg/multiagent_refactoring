    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=22, WMC=0, number of methods (nom)=0, number of public methods (nopm)=0, number of fields (nof)=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no methods to further decompose. Given the low size and complexity metrics and lack of internal functionality, there is no indication of insufficient modularization."
