    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: low number of fields (nof=2) and methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and modest size (loc=77). There is no evidence of many responsibilities or high internal complexity that would justify further decomposition based on the provided data."
