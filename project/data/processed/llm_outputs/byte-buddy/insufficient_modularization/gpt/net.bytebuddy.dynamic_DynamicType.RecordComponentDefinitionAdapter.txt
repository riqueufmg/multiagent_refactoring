    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: loc=56, wmc=0, nom=0 (no methods to decompose), nof=3 (few fields). Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although a list of dependencies is present, the class-level metrics show low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that it has not been sufficiently decomposed or that further modularization is required."
