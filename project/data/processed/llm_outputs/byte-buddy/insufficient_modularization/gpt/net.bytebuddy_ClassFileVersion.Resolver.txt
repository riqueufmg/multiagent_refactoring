    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed large or complex class: LOC is 51 but number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted methods complexity (wmc) = 0, indicating no concentrated implementation complexity to decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and there are no reported fields or package-level methods (nof = 0, nopf = 0, nopm = 0). Given the lack of methods and complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
