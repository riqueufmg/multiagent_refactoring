    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: loc=22, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. These metrics indicate minimal size, no internal behavior to split, and low coupling. There is no evidence of a large or complex implementation that would benefit from further decomposition."
