    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: it has a small-to-moderate size (loc=79), very low structural complexity (wmc=0), no declared methods (nom=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it depends on only two types. These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough, nor does it contain multiple responsibilities that would justify further decomposition."
