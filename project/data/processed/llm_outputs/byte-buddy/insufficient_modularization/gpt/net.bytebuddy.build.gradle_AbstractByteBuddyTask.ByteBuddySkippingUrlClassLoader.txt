    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTask.ByteBuddySkippingUrlClassLoader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Based on the provided metrics the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC is small (46), there are no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), complexity is minimal (wmc=0), and coupling indicators are zero (fanin=0, fanout=0) with no external dependencies. These values indicate the class is small and simple in isolation and does not require further decomposition according to the given data."
