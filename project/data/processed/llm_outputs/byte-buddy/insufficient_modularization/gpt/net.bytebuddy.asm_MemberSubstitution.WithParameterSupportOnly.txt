    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and simple: LOC=12, WMC=0, no fields or methods (nof=0, nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0), LCOM not applicable, and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). With no implemented methods or internal complexity and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence that the class has unresolved internal responsibilities that would require further decomposition."
