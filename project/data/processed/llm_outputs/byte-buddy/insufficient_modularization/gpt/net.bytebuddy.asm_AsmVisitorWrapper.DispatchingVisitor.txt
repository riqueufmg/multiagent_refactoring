    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class. LOC = 60 (moderate size) and WMC = 0 (no measured cyclomatic complexity) show low implementation complexity. NOM = 0 (no methods) and DIT = 0 indicate the class has no behavioral surface that would suggest multiple responsibilities to split. FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 show no coupling that would benefit from internal decomposition. Although NOF = 6 (six fields) could suggest state, by itself—given the lack of methods, complexity, and coupling—there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization."
