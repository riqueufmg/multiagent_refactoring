    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.SuperMethodCall",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High lack of cohesion (LCOM = 1.0) indicates the class's methods do not share common state, suggesting multiple unrelated responsibilities. The class size (LOC = 109) is moderate while containing only 4 methods (NOM = 4) and 2 fields (NOF = 2), implying relatively large or distinct method implementations that could be separated. All methods appear public (NOPM = 4) and WMC = 4 shows method complexity is modest but spread across unrelated behavior. Dependencies on several role-like inner components (WithoutReturn, TerminationHandler, Appender) further suggest multiple concerns bundled into this class. These factors, considered in isolation, support that the class is insufficiently modular and could benefit from decomposition."
