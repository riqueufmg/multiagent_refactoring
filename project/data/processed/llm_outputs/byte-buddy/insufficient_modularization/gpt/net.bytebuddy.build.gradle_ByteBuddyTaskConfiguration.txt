    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=37, NOM=2, WMC=2, LCOM=0.0. It has few fields (NOF=2) and only one public method (NOPM=1). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating no wide coupling. These metrics show low size and complexity and high cohesion, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
