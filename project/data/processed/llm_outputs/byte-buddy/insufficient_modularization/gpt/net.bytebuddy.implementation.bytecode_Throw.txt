    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=20, NOM=2, WMC=2 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show no coupling that would suggest unseparated responsibilities. DIT=1 indicates shallow inheritance. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
