    "justification": "The class is large and complex in isolation: loc = 153 and wmc = 17 (both high), nom = 8 with nopm = 7 (many methods, many public methods). These values indicate substantial implementation size and complexity that could be decomposed. Although lcom = 0.0 (high cohesion) and nof = 3 (limited state), the combination of high LOC and WMC with multiple public methods justifies that the class has not been sufficiently modularized and could be split to reduce size/complexity. Dependencies count (8 listed) further suggests multiple responsibilities/interaction points that may be separable."
