    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=49, WMC=0, nom=0, nof=1, nopf=0. It has no methods, no measured complexity or coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only a few declared dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is compact and cohesive; there is no evidence it has not been sufficiently decomposed."
