    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=72, number of methods=3, WMC=6. Although LCOM=0.6667 indicates moderate cohesion issues, the low method count and limited size (and no incoming/outgoing dependencies: fanin=0, fanout=0) do not provide sufficient evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
