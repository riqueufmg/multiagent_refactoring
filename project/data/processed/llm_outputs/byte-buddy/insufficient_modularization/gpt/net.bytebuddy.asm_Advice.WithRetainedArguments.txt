    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being too large or complex: loc=27 (small), nom=0 and nof=0 (no methods or fields to decompose), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling pressure). There is only a single listed dependency (MethodDescription). Given the absence of internal size, complexity, or coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
