    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.VisibilityBridgeStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single method (nom=1) with very low complexity (wmc=1) and small size (loc=48). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). These metrics indicate the class is small and simple, so there is no evidence that it has not been sufficiently decomposed or would benefit from further modularization."
