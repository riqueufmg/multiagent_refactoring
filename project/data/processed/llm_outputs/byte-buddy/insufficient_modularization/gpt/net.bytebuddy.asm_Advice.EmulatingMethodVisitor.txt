    "justification": "Metrics indicate no smell: small size (loc=48), no methods (nom=0) and therefore no method complexity (wmc=0), few fields (nof=3), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1 (not indicating cohesion problems). In isolation there is no evidence the class is excessively large or complex and thus no insufficient modularization."
