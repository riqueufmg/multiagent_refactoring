    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: although LOC is 204, it has only 3 methods (nom=3) and low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=3), indicating limited implementation complexity. Cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0) and coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0). The presence of 10 fields (nof=10) alone does not justify decomposition given the low method count and complexity. Dependencies are minimal. Therefore there is no strong evidence that the class must be further decomposed."
