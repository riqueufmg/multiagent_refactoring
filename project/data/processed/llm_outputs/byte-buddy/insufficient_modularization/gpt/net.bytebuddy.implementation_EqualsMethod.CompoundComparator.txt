    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc: 43), contains a single field (nof: 1) and no methods (nom: 0), has zero measured complexity (wmc: 0), zero incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin: 0, fanout: 0), and an LCOM of -1.0 indicating no cohesion problem in the provided data. These metrics indicate limited size and complexity, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided information."
