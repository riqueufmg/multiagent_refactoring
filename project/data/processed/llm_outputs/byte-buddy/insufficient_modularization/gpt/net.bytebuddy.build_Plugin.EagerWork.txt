    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=22, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted methods complexity (wmc)=0, number of fields (nof)=1. Coupling is minimal: fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). No methods or internal complexity to decompose further, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
