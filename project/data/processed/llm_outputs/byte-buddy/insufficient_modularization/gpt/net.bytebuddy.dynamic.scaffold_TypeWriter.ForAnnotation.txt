    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForAnnotation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LOC is relatively high (loc=118) while the class shows no declared methods (nom=0) and only one field (nof=1), indicating a large, monolithic implementation with few decomposed members; complexity/interaction metrics are minimal (wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion is not expressed (lcom=-1.0), so responsibilities are likely bundled rather than separated. The class also depends on net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, suggesting multiple concerns that could be extracted. These factors justify that the class has insufficient modularization and would benefit from decomposition."
