    "detection": true,
    "justification": "loc=236 and nof=6 indicate a relatively large class with multiple fields; method-level metrics are missing/zero (nom=0, nopm=0) which suggests behavior may be aggregated rather than decomposed. The class also lists multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy), implying mixed responsibilities. Taken in isolation, the size (LOC) combined with multiple fields and dependencies justifies that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is detected."
