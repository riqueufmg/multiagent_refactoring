    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.SimpleModuleReference",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=35, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), WMC=0 (no complexity), DIT=0, fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). LCOM=-1.0 indicates trivial cohesion. These metrics provide no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition; although some dependencies are listed, the class itself shows no signs of insufficient modularization."
