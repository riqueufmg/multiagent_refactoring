    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class: LOC=46, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1, DIT=0. Fan-in and Fan-out are 0 and dependencies are minimal. There are no methods and very low complexity/cohesion signals, so there is no evidence that this class has not been decomposed further or would benefit from additional modularization."
