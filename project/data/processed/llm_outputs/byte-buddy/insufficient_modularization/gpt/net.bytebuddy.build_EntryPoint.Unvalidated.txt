    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.EntryPoint.Unvalidated",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC 35), very few fields (nof 2), no methods (nom 0) and no complexity (WMC 0), shallow inheritance (DIT 1), low coupling (fanin 0, fanout 0), and high cohesion (LCOM -1.0). These metrics indicate the class is small, simple and self-contained, so further decomposition is not warranted."
