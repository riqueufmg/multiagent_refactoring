        "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 1004) combined with a high number of fields (nof = 35) and a non-trivial number of public fields (nopf = 9). At the same time it reports no methods (nom = 0) and zero measured complexity (wmc = 0), suggesting substantial implementation/state concentrated in a single class rather than decomposed into smaller, focused types. These metrics (loc, nof, nopf, nom) indicate the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
