    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and non-complex: LOC=13, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. With no methods or fields to decompose and no internal complexity or dependencies, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
