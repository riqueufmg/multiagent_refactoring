    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.RecordMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=15, WMC=2, NOM=2, NOPM=1. It has no reported coupling or reachability concerns (fanin=0, fanout=0, DIT=0) and a high cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0). Given the minimal size, method count, and low complexity, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
