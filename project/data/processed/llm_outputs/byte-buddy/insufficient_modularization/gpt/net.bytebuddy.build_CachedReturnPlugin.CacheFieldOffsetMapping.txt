    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin.CacheFieldOffsetMapping",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it has very small size and complexity (loc=22), only one field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating there is little to decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric is non-problematic (lcom=-1.0). These metrics show the class is already small and simple, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
