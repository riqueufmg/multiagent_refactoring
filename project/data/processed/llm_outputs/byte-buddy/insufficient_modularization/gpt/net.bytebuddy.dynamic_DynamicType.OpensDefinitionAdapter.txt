    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.OpensDefinitionAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: small size (loc=49), very low complexity (wmc=0), no methods to decompose (nom=0), and only a few fields (nof=3). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no evidence of high cohesion problems (lcom=-1.0 does not indicate a decomposable monolith). Given these metrics in isolation, the class does not meet the criteria for Insufficient Modularization."
