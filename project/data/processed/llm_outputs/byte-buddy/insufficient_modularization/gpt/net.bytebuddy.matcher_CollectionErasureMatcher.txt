    "justification": "Metrics show a small, cohesive class: loc=30, nom=3, wmc=4, nopm=2, nof=1 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size, low complexity and high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0) and there is no deep inheritance (dit=0). There is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or excessive size/complexity that would warrant further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
