    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.GenericTypeRegistrant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 121 lines of code (loc = 121) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and only a single field (nof = 1). This combination indicates a large amount of code contained without decomposition into methods or smaller units. Low coupling metrics (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and the absence of declared methods suggest that functionality is implemented in a monolithic block (e.g., large initializer or embedded logic) rather than modularized. These facts point to Insufficient Modularization."
