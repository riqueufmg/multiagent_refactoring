    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and contains no decomposable behavior: LOC=30, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, Fan-in=0, Fan-out=0. With zero methods/fields and negligible complexity/coupling (only two referenced types), there is no evidence that the class has an internal size or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
