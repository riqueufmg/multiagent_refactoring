    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.ModuleFinder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being too large or complex: loc=11, nof=0, nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. LCOM=-1.0 indicates no method cohesion measure due to absence of methods. Given the absence of fields, methods, and complexity, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition (the listed dependency does not change these internal metrics)."
