    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods reported (nom=0), low complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LOC=67, the absence of methods and low coupling/complexity provide no evidence that the class is large or contains multiple responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition."
