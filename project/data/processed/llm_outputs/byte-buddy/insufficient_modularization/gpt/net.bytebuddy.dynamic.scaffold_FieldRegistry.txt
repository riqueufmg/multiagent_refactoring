    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldRegistry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization because it has a relatively large implementation size (loc = 228) while exposing very few methods (nom = 2, wmc = 2). It declares many fields (nof = 11), which suggests multiple responsibilities or state that could be grouped or extracted. The presence of an inner/related type (dependency on net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldRegistry.Compiled) indicates some internal decomposition already, but the overall file size still remains large. Although cohesion (lcom = -1.0) and low complexity reduce the risk of tangled logic, the combination of high LOC and many fields with few methods indicates the class has not been further decomposed into smaller, focused modules and could be split to reduce size and improve maintainability."
