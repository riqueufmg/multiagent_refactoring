    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_jmhType_B3",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has an extremely large number of fields (nof = 256) while having no methods (nom = 0) and very low LOC (18). WMC = 0 and LCOM = -1.0 indicate absence of encapsulated behavior; DIT = 3 shows deeper inheritance but does not reduce the field bloat. The combination of many fields with no behavior/operations suggests the class has not been decomposed and should be modularized into smaller, cohesive units."
