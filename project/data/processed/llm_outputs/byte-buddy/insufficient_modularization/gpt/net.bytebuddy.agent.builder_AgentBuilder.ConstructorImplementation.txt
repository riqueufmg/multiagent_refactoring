    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: loc=57 (small size), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods and no measured complexity), nof=2 (only two fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling evidence), dit=1 (shallow inheritance). LCOM=-1.0 does not show degraded cohesion for further decomposition. Although several external types are listed in dependencies, the class's own low size and complexity metrics do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
