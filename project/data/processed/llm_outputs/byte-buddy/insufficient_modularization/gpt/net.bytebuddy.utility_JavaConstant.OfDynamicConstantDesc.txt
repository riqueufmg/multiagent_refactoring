    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=38, WMC=0, no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems. Given its small size and low complexity/coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
