    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is very large (loc = 1670) and exposes many fields (nof = 43), indicating multiple responsibilities that can be separated. Although nom = 1 and wmc = 1 are low, the class contains many nested/related types (nc = 15) and numerous internal components referenced in the dependencies (ForClassLoader, NoOp, MultiReleaseAware, Initializable, Dispatcher, CreationAction, BootLoaderProxyCreationAction, Resolution, ClassLoadingDelegate, etc.), which implies the class is acting as a container for many behaviors. The combination of high LOC, many fields, and many embedded components justifies decomposing this class into multiple, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
