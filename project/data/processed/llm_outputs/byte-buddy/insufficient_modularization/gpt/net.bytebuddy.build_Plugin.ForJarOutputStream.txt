    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that should be further decomposed: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted method count (wmc) = 0 imply no internal behavioral complexity to split; number of fields (nof) = 1 shows minimal state; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 with a single listed dependency indicate very low coupling; although lines of code (loc) = 64 is moderate, without multiple methods or measurable complexity there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities. LCOM = -1 is undefined/neutral and does not provide support for a cohesion-based decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
