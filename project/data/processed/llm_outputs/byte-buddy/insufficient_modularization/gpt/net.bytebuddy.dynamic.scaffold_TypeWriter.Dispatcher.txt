    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. Evidence: small size (LOC = 57), no methods reported (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and zero weighted method count (wmc = 0) indicating little internal behavior to decompose; low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate the class is already small and simple, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
