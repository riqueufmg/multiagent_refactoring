    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex single class that requires further decomposition: LOC=59 (modest size), NOF=2 (only two fields), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods/low complexity), DIT=1, LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issues detected due to lack of method logic), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling pressure). Although a few external dependencies are listed, the class in isolation has no behavioral complexity or many responsibilities that would justify marking it as insufficiently modularized."
