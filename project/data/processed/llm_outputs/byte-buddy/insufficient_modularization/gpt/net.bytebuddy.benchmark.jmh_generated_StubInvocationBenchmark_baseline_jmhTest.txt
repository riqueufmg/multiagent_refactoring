    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_baseline_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: a very large number of fields (nof = 263) combined with large size (LOC = 276) and relatively high complexity (WMC = 42). It has few methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) handling a disproportionate amount of state, which suggests multiple responsibilities packed into a single class rather than being decomposed. Its zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) indicates the complexity is internal to the class. These elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization and recommend further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
