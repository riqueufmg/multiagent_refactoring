    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an insufficiently modularized class: loc=96 (moderate size), nom=0 and nopf=0 (no methods/fields to decompose), wmc=0 (no measured complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), DIT=2 (reasonable inheritance depth). Dependencies are limited to three types. There is no evidence of high complexity, low cohesion, or high responsibility that would justify further decomposition."
