    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc = 26), very low structural complexity (wmc = 0), no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0), a single field (nof = 1), and no external coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
