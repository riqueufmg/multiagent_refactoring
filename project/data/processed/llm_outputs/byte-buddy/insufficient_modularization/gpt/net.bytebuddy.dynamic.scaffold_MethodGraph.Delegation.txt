    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, large or complex class: LOC is small (53), number of methods (nom) = 0 and WMC = 0 (no internal complexity to split), number of fields (nof) = 3 (small state), fanout = 0 and fanin = 0 (low coupling), and LCOM does not signal cohesion problems. Given these elements in isolation, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
