    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it has a very small public surface (nom = 2 methods, nopf = 0 public fields), low complexity (wmc = 2), high cohesion (lcom = -1.0), and no coupling indications (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Although LOC = 126 and nof = 6 show some size, the low method count and complexity and strong cohesion indicate the class is not an undivided, overly complex module that requires further decomposition."
