    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=29, no methods (nom=0), low complexity (WMC=0), only two fields (nof=2), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not show signs of insufficient modularization."
