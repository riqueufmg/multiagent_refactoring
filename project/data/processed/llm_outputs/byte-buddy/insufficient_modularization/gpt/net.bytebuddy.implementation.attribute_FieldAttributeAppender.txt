    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: it has a large size (loc=175) while exposing very little decomposition (nom=1), indicating a single large method likely carrying multiple responsibilities. It holds state (nof=3) but provides only one method to operate on it, suggesting behavior is concentrated rather than split into smaller units. Although cyclomatic complexity is low (wmc=1), that metric does not mitigate the large implementation size. The class also interacts with multiple distinct concerns as evidenced by its dependencies (AnnotationAppender, AnnotationValueFilter, FieldDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), which supports the view that the class is coordinating several responsibilities that could be separated. These elements together justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
