    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: low size and complexity (loc=83, wmc=0), no methods (nom=0) and only a small number of fields (nof=3), minimal external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies count=2). With no internal method complexity or high cohesion issues indicated, there is insufficient evidence in the provided metrics to recommend further decomposition."
