    "justification": "The provided metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class. LOC = 108 but NOM = 0 and WMC = 0, showing no methods or cyclomatic complexity to decompose. NOF = 3, FANIN = 0, FANOUT = 0 indicate low coupling, and LCOM = -1.0 implies high cohesion. Given the absence of methods and behavioral complexity, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
