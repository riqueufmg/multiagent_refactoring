    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy.UsingLookup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC is small (63), WMC is 0 and NOM/NOPM are 0 indicating no internal method complexity to decompose, NOF is 1 (very few fields), fanin and fanout are 0 (low coupling), and DIT is 1 (shallow inheritance). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
