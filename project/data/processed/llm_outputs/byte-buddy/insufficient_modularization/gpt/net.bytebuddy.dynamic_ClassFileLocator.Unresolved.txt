    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=22, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics show no evidence of a large, monolithic implementation that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
