    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.Simplex",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, simple class: LOC=36, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=2. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are only two external dependencies. There is no evidence of high complexity, many responsibilities, or large size that would suggest further decomposition is required when the class is considered in isolation."
