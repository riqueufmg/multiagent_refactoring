    "justification": "Class exhibits strong indicators of insufficient modularization: extremely large size (loc = 8174), very high number of fields (nof = 163) and many methods (nom = 47) combined with elevated complexity (wmc = 47). The dependency list contains a large number of nested/inner types and responsibilities (30+ TypeDescription.* nested types such as Builder, Visitor, Delegator, Substitutor, AnnotationReader, OfParameterizedType, OfWildcardType, OfTypeVariable, OfGenericArray, OfNonGenericType, OfLoadedType, etc.), indicating multiple distinct concerns bundled into the same class. Taken in isolation, these metrics suggest the class is doing too much and would benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
