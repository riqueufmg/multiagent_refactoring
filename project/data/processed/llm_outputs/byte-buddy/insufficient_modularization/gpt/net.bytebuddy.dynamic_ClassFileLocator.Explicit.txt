    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=54, no methods (nom=0) and no complexity (wmc=0). It has only 2 fields (nof=2) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only two listed dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and low behavioral complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
