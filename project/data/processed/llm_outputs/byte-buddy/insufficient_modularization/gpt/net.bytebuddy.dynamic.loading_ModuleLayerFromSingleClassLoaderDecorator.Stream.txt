    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.Stream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and not complex: loc=10, WMC=0, NOM=0, nof=0, nopf=0. It shows no internal implementation to decompose (no methods or fields) and has minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only a single listed dependency. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class suffers from insufficient modularization."
