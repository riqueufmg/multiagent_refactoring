    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=39, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is low (DIT=1). Lack of methods and very low complexity metrics indicate no remaining large, undecomposed implementation to split; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
