    "justification": "The class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 22, NOM = 0, WMC = 0, NOF = 1. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and there are no methods to split (nom = 0). Given the low size and complexity metrics and negligible dependencies, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
