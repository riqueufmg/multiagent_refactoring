    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.ClassWriterStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high size (loc = 118) but very few methods (nom = 2), implying large methods (~59 LOC per method) that could be further decomposed. WMC = 2 indicates low branching/complexity per method but does not mitigate the concentrated size; nof = 1 and nc = 1 show minimal state/constructors, and fanin = 0 / fanout = 0 indicate the class is self-contained. LCOM = -1.0 is uninformative, so cohesion cannot be trusted to justify monolithic structure. Together these metrics suggest the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
