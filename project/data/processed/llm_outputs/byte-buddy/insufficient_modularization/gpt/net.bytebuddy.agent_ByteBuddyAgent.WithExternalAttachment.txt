    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.WithExternalAttachment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and shows no evidence of being insufficiently modularized: LOC is only 30, it declares 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only 1 field (nof=1), cyclomatic/complexity metrics are zero (wmc=0), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no justification to flag Insufficient Modularization."
