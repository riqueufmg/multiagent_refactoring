    "justification": "Class is small and focused: LOC=40, number of methods=3 (public methods=2), and weighted method count WMC=3 indicate low complexity and limited responsibility. Cohesion is acceptable (LCOM=0.666...), indicating related behavior. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 2 external dependencies), and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1). These metrics show the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
