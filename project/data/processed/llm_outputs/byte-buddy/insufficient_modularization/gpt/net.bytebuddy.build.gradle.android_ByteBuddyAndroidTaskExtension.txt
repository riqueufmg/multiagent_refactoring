    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidTaskExtension",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of being insufficiently modular: large size (loc = 228), many methods (nom = 23) with most being public (nopm = 22), and substantial implementation complexity (wmc = 23). It also declares a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 11), which together with the high method count suggests multiple responsibilities or a large amount of behavior concentrated in one class. Although lcom = 0 indicates good internal cohesion, the absolute size and complexity metrics (loc, nom, nopm, wmc, nof) justify considering further decomposition to reduce class size and implementation complexity. dit = 0 (no inheritance depth) further suggests functionality is concentrated in this class rather than distributed via subclassing, increasing the potential benefit of refactoring into smaller modules."
