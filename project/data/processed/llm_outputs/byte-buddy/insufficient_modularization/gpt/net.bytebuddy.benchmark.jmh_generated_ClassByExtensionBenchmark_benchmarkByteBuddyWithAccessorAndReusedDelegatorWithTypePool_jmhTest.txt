    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very high number of fields (nof = 263) concentrated in a single class, substantial size (loc = 276) and elevated complexity (wmc = 42). Relative to the small number of methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) this indicates a large amount of state and/or responsibility bundled into one class rather than decomposed. These elements (high nof, high LOC, high WMC) justify recommending further decomposition."
