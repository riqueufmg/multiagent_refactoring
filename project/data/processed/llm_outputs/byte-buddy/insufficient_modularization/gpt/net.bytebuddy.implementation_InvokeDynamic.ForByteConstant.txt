    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=28), minimal state (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0), very low complexity (wmc=0), shallow inheritance (dit=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few dependencies. These metrics indicate there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
