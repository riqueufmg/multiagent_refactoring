    "justification": "Class shows no indication of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=12), no methods or fields reported (nom=0, nof=0, nopf=0), very low complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
