    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=35, number of methods=3, WMC=5 (low complexity), single field (nof=1), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). Inheritance depth is 0 (DIT=0) and it has no fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is simple, focused, and does not show signs that it requires further decomposition."
