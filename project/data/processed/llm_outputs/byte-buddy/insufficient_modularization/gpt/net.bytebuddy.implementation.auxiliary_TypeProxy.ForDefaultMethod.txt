    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=35), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), low field count (nof=3) and no coupling activity (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is not indicative (-1.0) and listed dependencies are limited. These metrics, considered in isolation, do not justify further decomposition."
