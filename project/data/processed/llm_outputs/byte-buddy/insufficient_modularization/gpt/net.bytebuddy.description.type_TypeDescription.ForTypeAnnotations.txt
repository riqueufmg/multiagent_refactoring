    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=89), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (WMC=0) suggest the class is not large or complex; only 2 fields (nof=2) and low coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0) provide no evidence that it needs further decomposition. Dependency list is minimal (TypeList). Therefore there is no indication this class suffers from insufficient modularization."
