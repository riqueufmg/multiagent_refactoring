    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForArgument",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 251) combined with a relatively high number of fields (nof = 14) suggests multiple responsibilities or bundled concerns that could be split. There are multiple external dependencies (ParameterDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Assigner, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, AnnotationDescription) implying varied interactions that often accompany mixed responsibilities. The absence of methods recorded (nom = 0) alongside many fields further suggests data and behavior are not cleanly encapsulated or that the class is carrying disparate data that could be decomposed into smaller, cohesive units. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
