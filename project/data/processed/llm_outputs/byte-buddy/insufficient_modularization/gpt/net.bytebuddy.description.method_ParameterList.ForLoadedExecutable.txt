    "justification": "Size and state: LOC = 224 indicates a relatively large class body; NOF = 10 shows substantial internal state. Coupling to multiple concepts: dependencies include net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription and net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, suggesting the class spans parameter description and dispatcher concerns. These elements (large LOC, many fields, and involvement with multiple responsibilities) are consistent with Insufficient Modularization — the class appears not fully decomposed and could be split to reduce size and responsibilities."
