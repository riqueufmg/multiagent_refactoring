    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of being insufficiently modularized: a relatively large body (loc = 159) combined with a high field count (nof = 14) suggests accumulated state and multiple responsibilities. It also depends on several distinct external concerns (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement), indicating mixed functionality that could be separated. These factors justify further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
