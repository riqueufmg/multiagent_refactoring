    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForVirtualInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted methods complexity (wmc) = 0 indicate no internal behavioral complexity to decompose; number of fields (nof) = 2 is small; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 indicate low coupling; listed dependencies are limited (TypeDescription, Implementation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). LCOM = -1.0 provides no evidence of cohesion problems. Although LOC = 72, the absence of methods/complexity and low coupling/fields means there is no justification, from the provided metrics, to flag insufficient modularization."
