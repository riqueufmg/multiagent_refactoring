    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, multi-responsibility class: although LOC = 125 could suggest moderate size, nom = 0 and wmc = 0 show there are no reported methods or method complexity to split; nof = 7 fields is modest and LCOM = -1.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and the class has a limited set of external dependencies. Taken in isolation, these elements do not justify an Insufficient Modularization smell."
