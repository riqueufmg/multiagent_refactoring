    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of Insufficient Modularization: LOC=34, NOM=0, NOF=1, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, LCOM=-1.0. It has no methods, minimal state, zero measured complexity and no dependencies, so there's no evidence that it is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
