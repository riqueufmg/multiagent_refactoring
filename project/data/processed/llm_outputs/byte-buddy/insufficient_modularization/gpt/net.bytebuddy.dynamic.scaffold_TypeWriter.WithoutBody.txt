    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithoutBody",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that needs further decomposition: number of methods (nom) = 0, number of fields (nof) = 3, weighted method count (wmc) = 0, lines of code (loc) = 75 but with no methods or complexity, lack of coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Although the class has several external type dependencies, its internal size and complexity are minimal, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
