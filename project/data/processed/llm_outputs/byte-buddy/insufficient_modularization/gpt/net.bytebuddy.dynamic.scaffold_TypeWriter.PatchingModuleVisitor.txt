    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.PatchingModuleVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows a relatively large size (loc = 144) while declaring multiple fields (nof = 7) but reporting no methods (nom = 0) and zero measured complexity (wmc = 0). This combination (many fields + large LOC + no methods) indicates the class likely bundles multiple responsibilities or data/behavior that have not been decomposed into smaller units. The unusual cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) and the presence of external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription) further suggest mixed concerns. These elements justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
