    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size (loc = 1255) indicates a single class containing a lot of implementation that could be split. It has a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 12) while having no reported methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0), suggesting responsibilities are concentrated and not decomposed into smaller cooperating methods/classes. The dependency set (MethodDescription, ModuleDescription, OpenedClassReader, ClassFileVersion, PackageDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) spans multiple concerns (method/bytecode handling, module and package description, class reading, versioning, and plugin support), implying mixed responsibilities. Fan-in/fan-out are both 0 and do not counterbalance the large LOC and field count. These indicators collectively point to insufficient modularization."
