    "justification": "Class is small and lacks internal complexity: LOC=58, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=3; no method-level cohesion issues (LCOM=-1.0) and no external couplings (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). With zero methods and minimal size, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
