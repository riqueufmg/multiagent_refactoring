    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.ForByteBuddyAgent",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high size (loc = 131) while exposing no methods (nom = 0) and only one field (nof = 1), indicating substantial implementation packed without decomposition into methods. The WMC is 0 despite large LOC, reinforcing that the code is not broken into smaller methods. Minimal dependencies (fanout = 0, listed dependency: net.bytebuddy.agent.Installer) do not explain the large internal size, so further decomposition into methods/classes would likely reduce size and complexity."
