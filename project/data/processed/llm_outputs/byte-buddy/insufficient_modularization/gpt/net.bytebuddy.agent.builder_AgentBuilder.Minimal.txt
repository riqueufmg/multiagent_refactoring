    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Minimal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows small size and low complexity: LOC = 37 and WMC = 0 indicate minimal implementation complexity. No fields or methods are reported (nof = 0, nom = 0), and coupling is low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Dependencies list only two external types. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
