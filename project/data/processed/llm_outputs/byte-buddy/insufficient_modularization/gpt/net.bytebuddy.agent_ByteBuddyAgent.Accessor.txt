    "justification": "Large size (loc = 208) combined with no declared methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0, wmc = 0) indicates behavior has not been decomposed into methods. The class holds state (nof = 6) but lacks method-level decomposition to operate on that state. LCOM = -1.0 shows cohesion metric is invalid/indicates lack of measurable method-based cohesion. These elements (high LOC, nonzero fields, zero methods, and invalid/low cohesion) support detection of Insufficient Modularization."
