    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 757) which indicates substantial implementation concentrated in one class; a high number of external type dependencies (13 distinct dependencies) suggesting multiple responsibilities and interactions that could be separated; a single field (nof = 1) combined with large LOC implies substantial behavior rather than state, which is frequently a cue to split responsibilities into smaller collaborators. The moderate inheritance depth (dit = 3) also suggests added complexity that could be reduced by decomposing functionality. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
