    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.FrameComputingClassWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc = 55), minimal state (nof = 1), no methods (nom = 0) and zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 0). Coupling is low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and it has only two external dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is small and simple rather than an undivided large component that needs further decomposition."
