    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 931) and many fields (nof = 28) indicate substantial implementation packed into a single class; the dependency list includes numerous nested/inner types (ModuleDescription.Optional, ModuleDescription.Module, ModuleDescription.Exports, ModuleDescription.ModuleDescriptor, ModuleDescription.Opens, ModuleDescription.Requires, ModuleDescription.Provides) suggesting multiple distinct responsibilities contained within one top-level class; despite a moderate method/complexity count (nom = 9, wmc = 9) the large LOC and many fields imply significant code volume likely located in those nested types rather than being split into separate classes; dit = 1 and nc = 1 indicate the class is a standalone holder of this functionality rather than being decomposed. These elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
