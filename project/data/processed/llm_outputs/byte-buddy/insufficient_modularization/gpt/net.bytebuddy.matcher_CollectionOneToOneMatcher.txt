    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: 46 LOC, 3 methods (2 public), 1 field. Complexity is moderate (WMC=8) but not high for further decomposition. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. No deep inheritance (DIT=0) or nested classes. Fan-in/fan-out are 0, showing low coupling. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
