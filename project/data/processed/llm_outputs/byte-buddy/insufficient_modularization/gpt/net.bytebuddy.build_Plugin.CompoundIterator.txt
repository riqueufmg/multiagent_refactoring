    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted methods complexity (wmc) = 0 show no concentrated behavioral complexity to decompose; number of fields (nof) = 2 is small; fan-in = 0 and fan-out = 0 indicate low coupling; LOC = 57 is moderate but, given zero methods and zero complexity, does not by itself justify further modularization. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
