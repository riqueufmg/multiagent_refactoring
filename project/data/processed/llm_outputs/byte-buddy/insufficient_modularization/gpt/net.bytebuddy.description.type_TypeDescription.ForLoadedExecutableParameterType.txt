    "justification": "Metrics show a small, low-complexity class when considered in isolation: loc=44 (small size), wmc=0 and nom=0 (no/very low implementation complexity and no methods to split), nof=3 (only three fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling suggesting cross-cutting responsibilities), and lcom=-1.0 (no evidence of lack of cohesion). There is no metric evidence of large size, high complexity, or multiple responsibilities that would indicate the need for further decomposition."
