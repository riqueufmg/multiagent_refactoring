    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being under-modularized: small size (loc = 79), low structural complexity (wmc = 0), no methods to split apart (nom = 0), a modest number of fields (nof = 4), minimal coupling (fanout = 0, fanin = 0), shallow inheritance (dit = 1), and limited external dependencies. LCOM is not indicating cohesion problems (lcom = -1.0). These metrics do not justify further decomposition."
