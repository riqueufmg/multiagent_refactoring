    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=2), 1 field (nof=1), low complexity (WMC=3) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). It has no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its small size, low complexity, and single-responsibility indicators, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition (no insufficient modularization)."
