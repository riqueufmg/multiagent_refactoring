    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High LOC (450) combined with a large number of fields (nof=21) indicates the class is large in size and holds substantial state. The very low number of methods (nom=1) and low cyclomatic measure (wmc=1) show the class's complexity is not concentrated in many methods but in other content (likely embedded logic or multiple responsibilities). The provided dependencies include multiple inner/related types (Configurable, WrappingDispatcher, Default) and several loading-related collaborators (ClassLoaderDecorator, PackageDefinitionStrategy, ClassInjector, ByteArrayClassLoader), suggesting the class aggregates multiple responsibilities or implementation variants instead of being decomposed. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, and DIT is 0, indicating the class is not tightly coupled via inheritance and could be safely refactored into smaller units. These facts together justify that Insufficient Modularization is present and the class should be decomposed into smaller, focused classes or modules."
