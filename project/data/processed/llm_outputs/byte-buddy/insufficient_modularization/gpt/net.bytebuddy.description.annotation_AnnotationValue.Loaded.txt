    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.Loaded",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: it is very small (loc=26), has a single field (nof=1) and no methods reported (nom=0, wmc=0) so there is nothing within the class to further decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric does not indicate a problem (lcom=-1.0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
