    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=51, NOF=3, NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no measured complexity), DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. Low field count, absence of methods and low coupling indicate the class is not large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition. Dependencies are limited and do not suggest internal complexity. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
