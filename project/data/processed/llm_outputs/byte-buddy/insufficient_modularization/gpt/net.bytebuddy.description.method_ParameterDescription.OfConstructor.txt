    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=42, WMC=0. There is no evidence of many members or large implementation (NOF=0, NOM=0, NOPF=0, NOPM=0). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=3). LCOM=-1.0 provides no indication of poor cohesion. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no indication that the class has insufficient modularization."
