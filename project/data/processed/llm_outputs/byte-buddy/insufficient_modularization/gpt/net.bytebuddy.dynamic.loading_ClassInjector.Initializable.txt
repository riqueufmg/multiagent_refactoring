    "justification": "No — the class shows no evidence of being insufficiently modularized. Metrics indicate very small size and no internal complexity or members: LOC=15, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, NC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. With zero methods/fields and negligible complexity there is nothing to decompose further. (LCOM=-1.0 is non-informative here.)"
