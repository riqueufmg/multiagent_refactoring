    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.InjectionStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 132 LOC (loc=132) while reporting 0 methods (nom=0) and WMC=0, indicating a relatively large implementation with no method-level decomposition. It declares 3 fields (nof=3) but provides no methods to encapsulate behavior, and cohesion is not defined (lcom=-1.0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, giving no evidence of external modularization. These metrics (high LOC combined with nom=0 and WMC=0) indicate Insufficient Modularization: the class appears monolithic and would likely benefit from decomposition into smaller methods or classes to reduce size and complexity."
