    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: number of methods (nom) = 0 and number of fields (nof) = 2 show minimal internal surface; weighted method count (wmc) = 0 and lack of coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) indicate low complexity and low responsibilities; only two external dependencies are listed. Although LOC = 80 is non‑zero, the absence of methods/complexity and low coupling do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
