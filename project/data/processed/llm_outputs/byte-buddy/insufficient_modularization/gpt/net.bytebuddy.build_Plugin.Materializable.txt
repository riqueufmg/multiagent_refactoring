    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Materializable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although LOC is 134 and there are 8 fields (nof=8, loc=134), the class shows no operational complexity or responsibilities that indicate missed decomposition: number of methods is zero (nom=0, nopm=0), weighted method count is zero (wmc=0), and there is no coupling or usage indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0, nc=0). LCOM is not meaningful here (lcom=-1.0). The minimal dependency set and absence of methods imply the type holds data/constants or is a marker-like type rather than a large, decomposable implementation, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
