    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=32, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two dependencies are referenced. There is no indication of high complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
