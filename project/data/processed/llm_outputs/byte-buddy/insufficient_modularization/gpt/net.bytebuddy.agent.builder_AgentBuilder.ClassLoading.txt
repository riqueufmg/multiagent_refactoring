    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and has minimal complexity and coupling: loc=35, wmc=0, nom=0, nof=1, fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency [net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool]. With no methods, very low complexity and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class is large or doing multiple responsibilities that would warrant further decomposition."
