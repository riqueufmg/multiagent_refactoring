    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class is large and shows signs of multiple responsibilities: LOC = 843 (very large), number of fields = 20, number of methods = 15 (13 public) and WMC = 16 indicating substantial implementation complexity. Cohesion is moderate (LCOM = 0.5333) rather than high, suggesting the class groups multiple concerns. The dependency list includes many inner-role types (EqualsMethod.NullValueGuard, EqualsMethod.SuperClassCheck, EqualsMethod.NaturalOrderComparator, EqualsMethod.UsingJump, EqualsMethod.NoOp, EqualsMethod.TypePropertyComparator, EqualsMethod.TypeCompatibilityCheck) which indicate distinct responsibilities that could be extracted. Given these metrics and the presence of multiple specialized inner components, this class appears insufficiently modular and would benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
