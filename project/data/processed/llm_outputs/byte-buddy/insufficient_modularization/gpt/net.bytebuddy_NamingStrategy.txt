    "class": "net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modular: it has very high size (loc = 381) while exposing very few methods (nom = 3) and only moderate fields (nof = 12), indicating one large file with few distinct operations. WMC is low (3) which, combined with the large LOC, suggests large method bodies or multiple embedded responsibilities rather than many small cohesive classes. The listed dependencies include nested/inner types (NamingStrategy.BaseNameResolver, NamingStrategy.Suffixing, NamingStrategy.ForUnnamedType), implying the class contains multiple contained strategies that could be split out. These facts together justify that further decomposition would likely reduce the class size and implementation complexity."
