    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin.SafeVarargsAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=28), no methods reported (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic weight (wmc=0) indicating low implementation complexity. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, single listed dependency) and no incoming usage (fanin=0). Inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1) and LCOM is not indicative of cohesion problems here. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
