    "justification": "LCOM = 0.8 indicates low cohesion among methods, nom = 5 with nopm = 4 shows multiple publicly visible methods (possible multiple responsibilities), and WMC = 5 with LOC = 46 suggests non-trivial internal complexity that is not large but spread across several methods. These factors (high lack-of-cohesion combined with multiple public methods and moderate complexity) justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition (Insufficient Modularization)."
