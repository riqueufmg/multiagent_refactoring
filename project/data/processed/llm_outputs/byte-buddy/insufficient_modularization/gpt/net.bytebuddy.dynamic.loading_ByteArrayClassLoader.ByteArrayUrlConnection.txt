    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: LOC=31, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Cohesion/complexity indicators do not suggest internal complexity (LCOM=-1.0), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). With no methods and minimal state, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that decomposition would reduce size/complexity."
