    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy.Undefined",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no fields (nof=0) and no methods (nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LOC=61, the absence of behavior means there is nothing to decompose; LCOM is not applicable (lcom=-1.0). Therefore there is no evidence of a large or complex class that requires further modularization."
