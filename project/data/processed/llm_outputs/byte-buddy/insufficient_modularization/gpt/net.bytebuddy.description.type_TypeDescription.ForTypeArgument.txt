    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC = 50 (modest size), NOF = 2 (only two fields), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods/low complexity), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling), DIT = 0. Dependencies are limited. Given the small size, minimal state, and lack of internal complexity, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization for this class."
