{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy.Lazy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=25), no methods/fields reported (nom=0, nof=0), zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), minimal inheritance depth (dit=1), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already small and simple, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided data."
