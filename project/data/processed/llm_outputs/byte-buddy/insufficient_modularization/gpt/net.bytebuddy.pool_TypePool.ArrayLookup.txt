    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ArrayLookup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low complexity: LOC=39, WMC=0, NOF=3, NOM=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no external dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem in this isolated context. Given its small size, negligible complexity, and lack of coupling, there is no evidence that this class requires further decomposition (Insufficient Modularization not detected)."
