    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=25, 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), WMC=0 indicating no implementation complexity. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
