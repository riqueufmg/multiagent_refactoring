    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.DescriptionStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class is large and holds many fields while offering no methods: LOC = 293 and NOF = 11 indicate substantial size and state. NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 suggest behavior is not encapsulated in smaller cohesive units within the class. The negative/undefined cohesion metric (LCOM = -1.0) and absence of method decomposition further support low internal modularization. These elements together imply the class likely groups multiple responsibilities or large amounts of data and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
