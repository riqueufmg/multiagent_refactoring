    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion.Unresolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=22, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal: fanin=0, fanout=0 and only one listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate low size, low complexity and low coupling, so there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition (no symptoms of Insufficient Modularization)."
