    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=22, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods), only 1 field (NOF=1). Coupling is minimal (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) and there are only 2 declared dependencies. These metrics indicate there is no evidence of an overly large or complex class that requires further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
