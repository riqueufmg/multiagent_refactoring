    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and not complex in isolation — LOC = 42, WMC = 0 (no cyclomatic complexity), NOM = 0 (no methods to decompose), NOF = 1 (one field), DIT = 0 (no deep hierarchy). Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only two external dependencies are listed. Given the absence of methods and low size/complexity metrics, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
