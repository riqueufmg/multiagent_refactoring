    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.StringSetMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=36, NOM=3, WMC=5 indicate low size and moderate complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion, NC=0 and DIT=0 show no nested/complex hierarchy, and fanin/fanout are 0 indicating no coupling pressure. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed; further modularization is not warranted."
