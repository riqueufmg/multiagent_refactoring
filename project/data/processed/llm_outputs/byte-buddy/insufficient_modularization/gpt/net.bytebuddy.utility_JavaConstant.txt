    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 1907) and a large number of fields (nof = 28) indicate excessive implementation contained in a single compilation unit. The dependency list contains many inner/related types named as nested members of JavaConstant (e.g. net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.OfMethodHandleDesc, .OfDynamicConstantDesc, .Simple, .MethodHandle, .MethodType, .ForKind, .OfDirectMethodHandleDesc, .OfMethodTypeDesc, .OfClassDesc, .Lookup, .Visitor, .Dispatcher, .MethodHandles, .OfTrivialValue, .MethodHandleInfo), which implies the class encapsulates many distinct responsibilities and subcomponents rather than being decomposed into separate top-level classes. Although wmc is low (2) and lcom is negative (indicating cohesion measures do not show fragmentation), the combination of very high LOC and numerous nested types signals a maintainability and modularization concern: the class should be split into smaller, focused classes (or move many inner types to their own classes) to reduce size and implementation complexity. Additional supporting metrics: nom = 2 with many implicit responsibilities (many nested types), and fanin/fanout = 0 suggesting the large body is self-contained rather than distributed—both consistent with insufficient modularization."
