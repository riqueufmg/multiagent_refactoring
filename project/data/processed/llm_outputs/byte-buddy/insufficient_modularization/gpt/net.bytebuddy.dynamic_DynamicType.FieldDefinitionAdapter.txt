    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.FieldDefinitionAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (loc = 39), effectively no behavior (nom = 0 methods, nopm = 0), and zero complexity (wmc = 0). It has only a single field (nof = 1) and no coupling evidence (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Cohesion metric is not indicating decomposition need (lcom = -1.0). Although there are several listed type dependencies, the class itself contains minimal implementation and responsibilities, so there is no justification from the provided metrics to decompose it further."
