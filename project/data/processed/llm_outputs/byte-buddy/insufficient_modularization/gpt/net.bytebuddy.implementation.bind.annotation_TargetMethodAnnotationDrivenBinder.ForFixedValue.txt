    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undivided, complex class: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted methods per class (wmc) = 0 show no internal behavioral complexity to decompose; number of fields (nof) = 2 and lines of code (loc) = 69 indicate small size; coupling metrics (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) show low interdependence. Given these values, there is no evidence in isolation that the class requires further decomposition."
