    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=38, WMC=0, nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one external dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Given the small size, low complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or that it requires further decomposition."
