    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.ClassByExtensionBenchmark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has moderate size (loc=309), a fair number of methods (nom=23) and fields (nof=13), its internal cohesion is high (lcom=0.1739) and its weighted method complexity is moderate (wmc=25). Depth of inheritance is minimal (dit=0) and there is no measured external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating a single, focused responsibility rather than multiple unrelated responsibilities. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization that would clearly benefit from further decomposition."
