    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a non-trivial size (loc=430) and several fields (nof=10), its reported complexity is moderate (wmc=21, nom=12) and cohesion is high (lcom=0.25). The presence of multiple nested/dependent types (ClassResettingTransformer, Dispatcher, Strategy, BootstrapInjection, Disabled) indicates responsibilities have been factored into inner components rather than being concentrated in a single monolithic class. Low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (dit=1) further reduce the likelihood that further decomposition is necessary. Taken in isolation, these metrics do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
