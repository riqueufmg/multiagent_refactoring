    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=45, number of fields (nof)=3, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted methods per class (wmc)=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence of high implementation complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
