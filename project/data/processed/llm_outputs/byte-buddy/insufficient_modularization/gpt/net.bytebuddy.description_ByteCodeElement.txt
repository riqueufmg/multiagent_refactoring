    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Insufficient modularization not detected. The class has only 1 field (nof=1) and 2 methods (nom=2) with low cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=2). Cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LOC is moderate (loc=103), the small number of methods and low complexity metrics do not indicate multiple responsibilities or a need for further decomposition. Dependencies are limited and do not suggest internal overgrowth (dependencies: net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.DeclaredByType, net.bytebuddy.description.NamedElement, net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable)."
