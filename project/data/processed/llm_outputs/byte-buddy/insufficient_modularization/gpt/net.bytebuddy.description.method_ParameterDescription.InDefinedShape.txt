    "justification": "Metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=20), no methods or fields to decompose (NOM=0, NOF=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), high cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class is lightweight with only two listed dependencies, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
