    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingReflection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows hallmarks of insufficient modularization: it is very large (loc = 1057) and contains many fields (nof = 29), indicating a large implementation surface that can be split. It also depends on a diverse set of responsibilities (JavaDispatcher, PackageDefinitionStrategy, DynamicType, ClassLoadingStrategy, TypeValidation, AccessControllerPlugin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Visibility, ConstructorStrategy), which suggests multiple concerns are being handled within the same class. The absence of a deeper type hierarchy (dit = 0) and the reported lack/aggregation of methods data (nom = 0) further imply behavior is consolidated rather than delegated to smaller classes. Together these metrics justify flagging this class as a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
