Cohesion metric unavailable (LCOM=-1.0) but there is no indication of many responsibilities or methods to split. Low coupling: FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and only two listed dependencies. These metrics indicate no evidence of insufficient modularization (no large size, no high complexity, no many methods)."
