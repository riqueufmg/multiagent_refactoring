    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.DoubleIndexed",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and already minimal: 24 LOC, 1 field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (dit=0). These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or would benefit from further decomposition."
