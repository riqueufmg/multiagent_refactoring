    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveNarrowingDelegate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: it is large (loc = 180) while exposing very few methods (nom = 3, nopm = 2), producing a high average size/complexity per method (~60 LOC/method). Cyclomatic complexity is elevated (wmc = 19), suggesting complex method bodies that could be split. The class declares many fields (nof = 10) relative to its small public API and has reduced cohesion (lcom = 0.666), implying multiple responsibilities or mixed concerns. It is standalone (dit = 0, nc = 0) so decomposition into smaller classes or delegates would likely reduce size and complexity. Dependencies on multiple concerns (Implementation, StackManipulation, StackSize, TypeDefinition) further support that the class is handling several roles that could be modularized."
