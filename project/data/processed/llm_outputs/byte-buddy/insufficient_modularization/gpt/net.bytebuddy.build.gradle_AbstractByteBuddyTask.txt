    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTask",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and handling multiple responsibilities: LOC = 474 (very large), NOM = 32 methods (high) with NOPM = 24 public methods, and WMC = 50 (high cyclomatic complexity). It also has NOF = 12 fields and even defines an inner type (AbstractByteBuddyTask.TransformationLogger), which suggests partial/inline decomposition but remaining size is still large. The dependency list exposes many distinct concerns (EntryPoint, Plugin, MethodNameTransformer, Transformation, Discovery, ObjectFactory, ClassFileVersion, ClassFileLocator), indicating multiple responsibilities that could be separated. While LCOM = 0.09375 shows some cohesion, the combination of large size, high method/count and complexity justifies further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
