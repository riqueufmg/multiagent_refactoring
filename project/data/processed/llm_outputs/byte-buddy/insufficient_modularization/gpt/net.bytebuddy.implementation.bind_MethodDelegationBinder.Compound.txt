    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=42, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), and only a single listed dependency. These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex and does not require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
