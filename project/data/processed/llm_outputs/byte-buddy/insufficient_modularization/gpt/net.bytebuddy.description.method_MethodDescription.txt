    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc=1695) combined with many fields and methods (nof=35, nom=29) and a non-trivial complexity (wmc=29) indicate it holds multiple responsibilities. The dependency list includes numerous inner/related types (MethodDescription.SignatureToken, Token, InDefinedShape, TypeToken, AbstractBase, Executable, ParameterList, ParameterDescription, AnnotationList, AnnotationValue, TypeList, TypeDefinition, TypeDescription, etc.), suggesting the class bundles many concepts that could be separated. Low inheritance depth (dit=1) and many contained elements further support that this class has not been decomposed and would benefit from refactoring into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
