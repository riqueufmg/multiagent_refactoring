    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=39, nom=0 (no methods), nof=1 (one field), wmc=0 (no measured complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no external coupling). There is no internal implementation complexity or multiple responsibilities to decompose; LCOM is unavailable (-1.0) but other measures show no evidence that further modularization would reduce size or complexity. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
