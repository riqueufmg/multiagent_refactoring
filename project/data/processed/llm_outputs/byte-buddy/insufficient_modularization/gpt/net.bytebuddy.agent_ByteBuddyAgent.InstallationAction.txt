    "justification": "Class has very low size and complexity (loc=27, wmc=0), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only one field (nof=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]), cohesion metric not indicating fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). In isolation there is no internal complexity or multiple responsibilities to decompose further, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
