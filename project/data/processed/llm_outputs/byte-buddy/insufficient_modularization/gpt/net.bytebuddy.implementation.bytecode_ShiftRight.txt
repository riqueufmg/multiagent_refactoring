    "justification": "Class shows low size and complexity: LOC=93, NOM=4, WMC=4. It has a small number of fields (NOF=5) and few public methods (NOPM=3). Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1). Coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and listed dependencies are limited. Given the class-level metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required to reduce size or complexity."
