    "justification": "Large physical size (loc = 404) indicates a substantial implementation that is a candidate for further decomposition; decomposition-related metrics show no measured methods or fields (nom = 0, nof = 0, nopf = 0, nopm = 0), suggesting the class has not been modularized into smaller units; multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList) imply it handles several concerns; LCOM = -1.0 (undefined/low cohesion indicator) further supports insufficient modularization."
