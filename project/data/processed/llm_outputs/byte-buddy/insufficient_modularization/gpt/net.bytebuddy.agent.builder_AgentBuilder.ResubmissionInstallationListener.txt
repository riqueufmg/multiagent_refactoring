    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ResubmissionInstallationListener",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high number of fields (nof = 14) and a non-trivial size (loc = 144), suggesting multiple responsibilities or internal state that could be split. Measured method/complexity counts (nom = 0, wmc = 0) are either absent or indicate a measurement artifact, reinforcing the need for manual inspection; the low coupling to other types (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dependencies = 2) implies internal decomposition is feasible without broad ripple effects. These elements together justify flagging the class for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
