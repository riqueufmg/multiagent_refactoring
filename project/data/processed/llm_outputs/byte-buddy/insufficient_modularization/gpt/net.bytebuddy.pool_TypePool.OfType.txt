    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted methods complexity (wmc) = 0 show no behavioral bulk to decompose; number of fields (nof) = 2 is very small; coupling/familiarity metrics fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 and only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) indicate low coupling; cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) and absence of methods do not suggest multiple responsibilities. Although loc = 73 is moderate, it is not accompanied by method complexity or counts that would indicate insufficient modularization."
