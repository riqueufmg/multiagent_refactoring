    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayLength",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=20, nom=2, wmc=2. High cohesion and low complexity: lcom=-1.0. Low coupling and minimal dependencies: fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]. Shallow inheritance: dit=1. Given these metrics the class does not exhibit signs of being insufficiently modularized and does not warrant further decomposition."
