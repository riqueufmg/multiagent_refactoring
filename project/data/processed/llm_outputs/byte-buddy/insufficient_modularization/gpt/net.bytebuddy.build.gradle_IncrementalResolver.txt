    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=40, NOM=1, WMC=1 indicating very low complexity and a single method/responsibility. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 with only one external dependency (org.gradle.work.ChangeType) show limited coupling. There is no evidence of large size, multiple responsibilities, or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
