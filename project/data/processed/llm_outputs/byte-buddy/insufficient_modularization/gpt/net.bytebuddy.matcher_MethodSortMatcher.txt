    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=115, NOM=4, WMC=4, NOF=3 and LCOM=0.0. Low cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC=4), few methods (NOM=4, public methods=3) and perfect cohesion (LCOM=0.0) suggest responsibilities are focused. No fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0) further indicate the class does not show signs of being insufficiently modularized. Therefore no decomposition is indicated."
