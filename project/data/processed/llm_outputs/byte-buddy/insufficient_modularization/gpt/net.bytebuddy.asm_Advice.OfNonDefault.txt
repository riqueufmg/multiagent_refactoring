    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OfNonDefault",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class size and complexity are minimal: LOC=22, NOM=0, WMC=0. It has effectively no operational surface (no methods) and minimal state (NOF=1) with no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single build-time dependency. These metrics indicate the class is already small and simple, so there is no evidence it requires further decomposition."
