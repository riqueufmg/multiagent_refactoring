    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=30, WMC=0, NOM=0 indicate minimal implementation and no internal complexity to decompose. Low coupling and usage: fanin=0 and fanout=0, with only 3 listed type dependencies. DIT=2 is modest and LCOM=-1.0 (indicating no cohesion concern in the provided data). There is no evidence in these metrics of a large, complex class that requires further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
