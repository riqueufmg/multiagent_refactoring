    "justification": "Not detected: although LOC=155 is moderate, the class shows no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc=0), indicating no decomposable behavior inside the class. It contains only 4 fields (nof=4, nopf=0) and has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 and the small dependency list (net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) do not indicate multiple distinct responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition in isolation."
