    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=17, NOF=1, NOPF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. It has no methods and only a single field, indicating a lightweight holder/marker rather than a large undecomposed class. Given these metrics (considering the class in isolation), there is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
