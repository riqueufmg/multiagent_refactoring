    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.ForNonStaticMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: loc=52 (small size), nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods to decompose), wmc=0 (no implementation complexity), nof=2 (only two fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling pressure), and only one external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate a small, low-complexity, low-coupling class with no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
