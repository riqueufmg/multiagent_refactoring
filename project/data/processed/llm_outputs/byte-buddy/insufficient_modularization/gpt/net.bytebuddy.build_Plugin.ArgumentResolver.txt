    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ArgumentResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 229) with a relatively high number of fields (nof = 8) while reporting zero methods (nom = 0), suggesting bundled responsibilities or internal complexity that is not decomposed into smaller cooperating methods/classes. Cohesion metric is not positive (lcom = -1.0), indicating low/unknown cohesion. The class has at least one external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) but no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), reinforcing that the complexity is internal. These elements together justify that the class should be decomposed further to reduce size and implementation complexity."
