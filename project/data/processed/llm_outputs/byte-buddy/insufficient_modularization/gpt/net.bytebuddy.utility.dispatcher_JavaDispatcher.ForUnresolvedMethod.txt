    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and non-complex: LOC=33, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1. Low coupling and dependency footprint: fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies count=2. No methods or measurable complexity/size indicating an undecomposed responsibility; LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems in this isolated view. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
