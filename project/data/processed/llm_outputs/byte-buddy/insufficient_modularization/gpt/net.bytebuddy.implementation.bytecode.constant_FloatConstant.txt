    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition: LCOM = 0.75 (low cohesion) suggests the fields and methods are not tightly related; LOC = 83 and WMC = 7 show moderate size and complexity for only nom = 4 methods (nopm = 3 public), implying multiple responsibilities are implemented within few methods; the class has no deep inheritance (DIT = 1) to distribute behavior. Dependencies on distinct concerns (StackManipulation, StackSize, Implementation, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) further suggest mixed responsibilities. Together these elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
