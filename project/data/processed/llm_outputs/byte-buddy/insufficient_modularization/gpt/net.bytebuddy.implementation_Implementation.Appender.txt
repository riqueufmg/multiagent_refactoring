    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not overly complex: LOC=22, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0. It has minimal state (nof=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency listed). Cohesion metric indicates no cohesion problem (LCOM=-1.0). Given the lack of size, methods, complexity, and coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
