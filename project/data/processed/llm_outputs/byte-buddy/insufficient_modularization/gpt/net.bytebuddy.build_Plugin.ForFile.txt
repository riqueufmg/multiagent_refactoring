    "justification": "No evidence of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=40), no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=2 but nopf=0 indicates no complex field behavior), very low complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), cohesion metric not indicating fragmentation (lcom=-1.0), and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Only a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate the class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition."
