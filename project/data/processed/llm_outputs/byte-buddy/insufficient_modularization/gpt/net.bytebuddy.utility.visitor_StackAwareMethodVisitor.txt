    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor.StackAwareMethodVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows high size and complexity consistent with Insufficient Modularization: LOC = 318 and WMC = 84 indicate a large, complex implementation; NOM = 24 (NOPM = 19 public methods) shows many methods / responsibilities exposed; NOF = 6 with NOPF = 2 indicates relatively few fields backing a large method set (implementation-heavy). While LCOM = 0.125 suggests decent cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high WMC and a large number of (public) methods supports that the class has not been decomposed enough and could be split to reduce size and complexity."
