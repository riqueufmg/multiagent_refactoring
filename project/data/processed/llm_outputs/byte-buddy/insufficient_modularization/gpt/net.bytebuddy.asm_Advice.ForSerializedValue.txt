    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large or complex class. LOC is moderate (94), there are no methods (NOM=0) and no complexity (WMC=0), suggesting the class is not implementing multiple responsibilities; it has six fields (NOF=6) but no evidence of poor cohesion or high coupling (LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0). Given these values and the dependency set, there is insufficient metric evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization."
