    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, low-complexity class: LOC=22, WMC=0, NOF=1, NOM=0, NOPM=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods or significant fields to decompose and coupling is nil. Given its minimal size and complexity (considered in isolation), there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
