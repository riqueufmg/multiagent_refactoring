    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC is moderate (77) but the class has 0 methods (nom: 0) and very low complexity (WMC: 0). Field count is minimal (nof: 1), cohesion metric is not indicating fragmentation (LCOM: -1.0), inheritance depth is 0 (DIT: 0), and coupling is negligible (fanin: 0, fanout: 0). Dependencies are limited. These elements suggest the class is small/simple in isolation and does not exhibit the size or complexity symptoms of Insufficient Modularization."
