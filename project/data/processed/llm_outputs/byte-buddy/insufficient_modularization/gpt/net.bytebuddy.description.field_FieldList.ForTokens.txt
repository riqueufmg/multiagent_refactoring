    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=42, nof=2, nom=0, wmc=0. Coupling and complexity are minimal: fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=0. There are no methods to decompose and dependencies are limited (TypeDescription, FieldDescription). These metrics indicate the class is already sufficiently modular and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
