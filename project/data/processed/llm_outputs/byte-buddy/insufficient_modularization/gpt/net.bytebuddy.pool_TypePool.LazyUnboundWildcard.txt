    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=46, WMC=0, NOM=0 and NOF=3 indicate few lines, no methods and only three fields. Coupling is low: FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and only two listed dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Given the lack of methods or internal complexity to decompose, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
