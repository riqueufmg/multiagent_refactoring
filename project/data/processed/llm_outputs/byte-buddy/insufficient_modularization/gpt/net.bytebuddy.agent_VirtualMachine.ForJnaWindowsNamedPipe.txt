    "justification": "Class exhibits signs of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 339) combined with many fields (nof = 10, nopf = 1) but no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0). The high LOC with zero methods suggests a single, undecomposed implementation body or heavy initialization logic that could be split into smaller classes or methods to reduce size and complexity. Supporting metrics (wmc = 0, lcom = -1.0) do not indicate well-structured modular responsibilities, reinforcing the need for decomposition."
