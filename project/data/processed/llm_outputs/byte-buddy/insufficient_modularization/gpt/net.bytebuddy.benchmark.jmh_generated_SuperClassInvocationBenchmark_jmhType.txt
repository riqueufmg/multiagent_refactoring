    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_jmhType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has LOC=2, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPM=0 and WMC=0 indicating no methods, no fields and no implementation complexity. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 show no coupling through calls. Although DIT=4 indicates a deep inheritance level, the class itself is trivially small and contains no decomposable responsibilities, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
