    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ResubmissionScheduler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 158) combined with a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 7) while reporting no methods (nom = 0). This suggests the class contains substantial state and likely mixed responsibilities without method-level decomposition. Cohesion is not clearly established (lcom = -1.0) and complexity indicators (wmc = 0) do not reflect internal modular structure. Together these elements (loc, nof, nom, lcom) justify that the class would benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more focused classes or modules."
