    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (LOC = 971) with a high number of fields (nof = 39) but relatively few methods (nom = 11), indicating long methods and/or embedded responsibilities that could be split. The dependency list contains many specialized inner/related translator types (TypePathTranslator, HandleTranslator, AttributeTranslator, LabelArrayTranslator, ConstantDynamicTranslator, ConstantArrayTranslator, FrameTranslator, LabelTranslator, ConstantTranslator) which signals multiple distinct responsibilities (constant handling, label/frame translation, attributes, handles, etc.) concentrated in this single class. Although LCOM is moderately low (0.27), the sheer size and the presence of numerous translator roles justify decomposing the class into smaller modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
