    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyInterface",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=37), very low structural complexity (nom=0, wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods (nopm=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, nc=0), shallow inheritance (dit=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition."
