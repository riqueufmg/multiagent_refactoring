    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.ConstructorStrategy.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization because its source size is large (loc = 158) while it has a small number of fields (nof = 2), suggesting substantial implementation concentrated in few places. It depends on many distinct concepts (net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher, MethodDescription, SuperMethodCall, MethodRegistry, MethodAttributeAppender, MethodList, TypeDescription, Transformer, etc.), indicating multiple responsibilities or concerns. The inheritance depth (dit = 1) and cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) combined with the large LOC imply that the class likely mixes behavior that could be split into smaller, more focused classes or strategy implementations to reduce size and complexity."
