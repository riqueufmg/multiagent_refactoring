    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=11), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), zero cyclomatic/complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only a single declared dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). LCOM is -1.0 (no meaningful cohesion data). Given the class is minimal and has no measurable internal complexity or responsibilities to decompose, insufficient modularization is not detected."
