    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=34, NOF=2, NOM=0, WMC=0. Coupling and usage are minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0). Depth of inheritance is low (DIT=1) and LCOM=-1.0 suggests cohesion is not an issue. Given the lack of methods/complexity and low size, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
