    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 104 LOC, other indicators do not suggest a need for further decomposition: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted method complexity (wmc) = 0 imply no internal method-level complexity to split; lack of coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only 4 fields (nof = 4) indicate it is self-contained; LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate low cohesion. Given the absence of methods, complexity, or coupling that would benefit from modularization, the Insufficient Modularization smell is not detected."
