    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC = 73, WMC = 0, NOM = 0, NOF = 4. Cohesion and coupling do not indicate decomposition needs: LCOM = -1.0 (no cohesion concern shown), fanin = 0, fanout = 0. With no methods and minimal size/complexity in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
