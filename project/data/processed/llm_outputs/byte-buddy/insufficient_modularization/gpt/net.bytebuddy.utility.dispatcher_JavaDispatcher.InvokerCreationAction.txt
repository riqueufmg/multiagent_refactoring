    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small (loc=11), no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), zero cyclomatic/complexity (wmc=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
