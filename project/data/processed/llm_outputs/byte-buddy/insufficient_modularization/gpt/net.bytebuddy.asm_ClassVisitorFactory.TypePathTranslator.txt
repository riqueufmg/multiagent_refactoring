    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=45, nof=3 (only 3 fields), nom=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no measurable complexity), DIT=1 (shallow inheritance), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issues reported). Given its small size, lack of methods/complex logic, and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
