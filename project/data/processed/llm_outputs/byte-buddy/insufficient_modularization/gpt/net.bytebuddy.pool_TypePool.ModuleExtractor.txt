    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC=81 (modest size), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods and no cyclomatic complexity to suggest a large fused implementation), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling pressure), only 2 external dependencies listed. Although NOF=10 shows several fields, in isolation there is no evidence of high implementation complexity or many responsibilities that would require decomposition. LCOM is not informative (-1.0). Therefore there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization."
