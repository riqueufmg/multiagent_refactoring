    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=16, wmc=0, nom=0, nof=0, nopm=0. Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader). LCOM is -1.0 (no cohesion concern given no members). Given its low size, complexity, and coupling, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
