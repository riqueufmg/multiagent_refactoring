    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC = 109 (moderate), NOF = 3, NOM = 0, WMC = 0, LCOM = -1.0, FANIN = 0, FANOUT = 0. The class has no methods (NOM=0) and zero measured complexity (WMC=0), and shows no coupling to or from other classes (fanin/fanout = 0). Given the small number of fields and lack of internal behavioral complexity or responsibilities to split, there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
