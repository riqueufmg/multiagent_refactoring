    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class: LOC is 75 but there are 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0), suggesting no large method bodies or concentrated logic to split. The class has a single field (nof=1), very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only three external dependencies. These elements show no evidence of multiple responsibilities or high implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
