    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Dispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 481) and a high number of fields (nof = 25) indicate it contains substantial implementation and state that could be split. The presence of multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType) suggests mixed responsibilities. The cohesion metric is not positive (lcom = -1.0), pointing to low/undefined cohesion. These elements (loc=481, nof=25, multiple dependencies, low/undefined LCOM) justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
