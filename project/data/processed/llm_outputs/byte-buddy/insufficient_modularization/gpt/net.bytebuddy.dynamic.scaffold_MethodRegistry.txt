    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is very large (loc = 776) and holds many fields (nof = 33) while exposing few top-level methods (nom = 3), which suggests internal complexity is implemented via many nested constructs rather than decomposition. The dependency list shows multiple closely related nested/inner roles (MethodRegistry.Compiled, MethodRegistry.Prepared, MethodRegistry.Handler, MethodRegistry.ForVisibilityBridge) and many responsibilities (TypeInitializer, TypeValidation, TypeWriter, MethodGraph, Implementation, ByteCodeAppender, MethodAttributeAppender, VisibilityBridgeStrategy, etc.), indicating the class spans several distinct concerns (preparation, compilation, visibility bridging, writing). These facts together (large LOC, many fields, multiple distinct responsibilities and inner types) justify that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and should be refactored into smaller, focused modules."
