    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy.EnumerationImplementation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (loc=112) while declaring multiple fields (nof=8) but no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), which suggests responsibilities are embedded in state or initializers rather than separated into cohesive behaviors; the dependency set (7 distinct dependencies: MethodReturn, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, FieldDescription, TypeDescription, TargetType, StackManipulation, Duplication) indicates interaction with multiple, different concerns, implying multiple responsibilities; the low/negative cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0) together with dit=1 and fanin/fanout=0 supports that the class is not well modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
