    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.NameMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show a small, cohesive, low-complexity class: LOC=26, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOF=1, LCOM=0.0, NC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. These values indicate few methods/fields, low cyclomatic complexity, high cohesion and low coupling, so there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
