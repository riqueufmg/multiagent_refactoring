    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has a relatively large size (loc: 106) while exhibiting minimal structural decomposition (nom: 0 methods, nof: 1 field). The combination of high LOC with zero declared methods suggests implementation is not decomposed into smaller responsibilities. Cohesion metric is unavailable (lcom: -1.0) and complexity metrics are not informative (wmc: 0), but the class is isolated (fanin: 0, fanout: 0) which indicates it can be safely split without breaking dependencies. These elements (loc=106, nom=0, nof=1, fanin=0, fanout=0) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
