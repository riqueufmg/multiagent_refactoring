    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication.WithFlip",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=46, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=2 fields. Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
