    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=26, WMC=0, NOM=0. It has at most 1 field (NOF=1) and no methods to decompose, LCOM is not indicating cohesion issues (-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two listed dependencies. These metrics do not show size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
