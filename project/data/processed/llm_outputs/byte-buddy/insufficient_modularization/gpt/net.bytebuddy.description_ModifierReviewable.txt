    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc=542) while exposing very few methods (nom=4) and only one field (nof=1), which indicates long, monolithic method bodies rather than smaller, focused components. It depends on a wide range of distinct modifier types (16 dependencies: ParameterManifestation, Transitivity, MethodStrictness, RequiredPhase, SynchronizationState, MethodManifestation, Ownership, Openness, Mandate, FieldManifestation, SyntheticState, TypeManifestation, FieldPersistence, ProvisioningState, Visibility, EnumerationState), implying multiple responsibilities bundled into one class. Low coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) show the class is isolated rather than factored into collaborating units. These elements together justify that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
