    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and simple (LOC=55), has no methods (nom=0), low complexity (WMC=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), zero coupling activity (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single dependency. These metrics show no indication of excessive size or implementation complexity that would require further decomposition."
