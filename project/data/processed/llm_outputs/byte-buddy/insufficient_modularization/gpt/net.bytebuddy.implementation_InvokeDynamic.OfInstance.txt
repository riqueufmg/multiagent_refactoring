    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.OfInstance",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: small size (loc=37), very low structural complexity (wmc=0), no methods to decompose (nom=0), only 2 fields (nof=2) with no public fields (nopf=0), and no coupling indications (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependencies are minimal (2). These metrics indicate a small, simple class rather than a large, undecomposed one, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
