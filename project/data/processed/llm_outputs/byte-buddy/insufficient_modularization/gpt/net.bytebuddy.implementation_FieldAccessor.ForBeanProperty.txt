    "justification": "The class shows no indicators of Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=47), no methods (nom=0) and no public methods/fields (nopf=0, nof=0), zero measured complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependency list. These metrics do not indicate a large, complex, or low-cohesion unit that would benefit from further decomposition."
