    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and low complexity: LOC=35, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=2. Low coupling and interaction: fanin=0, fanout=0. Shallow hierarchy: DIT=0. Cohesion indicator is favourable (LCOM=-1.0). Given these metrics and the absence of implemented methods or complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; no insufficient modularization detected."
