    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc = 38), no fields or methods (nof = 0, nom = 0, nopf = 0, nopm = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0) and zero coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). There are no dependencies listed. The LCOM value is -1.0 (likely unavailable), but given the absence of members and low LOC, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
