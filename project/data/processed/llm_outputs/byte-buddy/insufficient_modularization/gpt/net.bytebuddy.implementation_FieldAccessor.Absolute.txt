    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has low size and complexity: loc=40, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0. There are no methods to decompose (nom=0) and cohesion metric is not indicating internal fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited. Given the class's small footprint and lack of behavioral complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
