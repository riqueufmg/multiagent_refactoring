    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.TerminationHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely case of Insufficient Modularization because its source size is large (loc = 177) while having no reported methods (nom = 0) and zero weighted method count (wmc = 0), indicating substantial implementation content that is not decomposed into smaller methods or responsibilities. It has a small number of fields (nof = 3) and zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), which suggests low coupling but a concentrated internal size — a typical sign that the class holds multiple responsibilities that could be split. The dependency list (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, FieldDescription, Assigner, ElementMatcher, StackManipulation) shows interaction with multiple concepts, supporting the need for decomposition into focused subcomponents."
