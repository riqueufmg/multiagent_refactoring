    "justification": "Class appears small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 36, WMC = 0, number of fields = 1, number of methods = 0. Cohesion metric (LCOM = -1.0) and coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) do not indicate internal complexity or high responsibilities. Only a single external dependency is listed. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
