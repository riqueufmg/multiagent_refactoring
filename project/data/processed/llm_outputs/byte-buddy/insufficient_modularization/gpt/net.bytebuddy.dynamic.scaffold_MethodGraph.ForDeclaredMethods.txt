    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.ForDeclaredMethods",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc = 35), no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and minimal dependencies (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition."
