    "justification": "The class shows no signs of excessive size or complexity: loc=41, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=2, dit=1. Cohesion indicator is high (lcom=-1.0) and there are no inbound/outbound coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0) beyond a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). In isolation these metrics indicate a small, cohesive unit with little behavior to decompose, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
