    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very small size (LOC 39), only one field (nof 1), no methods (nom 0) and zero complexity (WMC 0). No incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin 0, fanout 0) and LCOM -1.0 indicates no measurable lack of cohesion due to absence of methods. These elements show no evidence that the class holds multiple responsibilities that require further decomposition."
