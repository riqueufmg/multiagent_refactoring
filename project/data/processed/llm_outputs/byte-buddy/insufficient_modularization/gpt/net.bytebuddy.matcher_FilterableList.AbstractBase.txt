    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it has only 44 LOC, 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0) and WMC=0 indicating negligible internal complexity. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies) and cohesion metric is favorable (lcom=-1.0). Given its small size, low complexity, and lack of external interactions, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
