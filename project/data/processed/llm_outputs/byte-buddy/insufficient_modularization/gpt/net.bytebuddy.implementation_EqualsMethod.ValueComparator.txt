    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows a large size (loc=215) while having no detected methods (nom=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0), which indicates a monolithic implementation or data-heavy class that is not decomposed into smaller methods or collaborators. A shallow inheritance depth (dit=1) and zero fan-out (fanout=0) imply little use of inheritance or delegation to factor responsibilities out. These indicators (high LOC combined with nom=0, dit=1, and fanout=0) justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
