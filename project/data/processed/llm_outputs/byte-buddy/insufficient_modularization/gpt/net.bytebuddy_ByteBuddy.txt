    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 898), high implementation complexity (wmc = 59), many methods (nom = 52) with almost all methods exposed (nopm = 50), and a large number of fields (nof = 35). Cohesion is moderate-to-low (lcom = 0.423), and the class depends on a large set of external types (54 listed dependencies). The combination of high LOC, high WMC, many (mostly public) methods and many dependencies indicates the class is undertaking multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
