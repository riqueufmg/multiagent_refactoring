    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType.NamingStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex single responsibility: LOC=83 is modest; number of methods nom=0 and weighted method count wmc=0 show no concentrated method complexity; number of fields nof=4 is small; coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two dependencies are listed. Given these values, there is no evidence the class has not been decomposed and therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
