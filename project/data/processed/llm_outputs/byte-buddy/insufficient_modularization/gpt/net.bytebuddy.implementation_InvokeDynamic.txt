    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class appears insufficiently modular: it is very large (loc = 2217) and complex (WMC = 66) while exposing a large API and state (nom = 43 methods, nopm = 42 public methods, nof = 53 fields). It has no inheritance depth to distribute behavior (dit = 0) and only a single child (nc = 1), indicating responsibilities are concentrated in this class. The dependency list shows many inner/role-like types (e.g. InvokeDynamic.ForField, ForInterceptedMethod, ForMethodParameter, InvocationProvider, TerminationHandler, WithImplicitArguments, WithImplicitTarget, WithImplicitType, ReturnTypeProvider, ArgumentProvider, NameProvider, Resolved, Target), which suggests multiple distinct responsibilities or subcomponents implemented inside/around this class instead of being decomposed into separate classes. Taken together — large size, high cyclomatic complexity, many fields/methods, and numerous role-like nested types — these indicators justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
