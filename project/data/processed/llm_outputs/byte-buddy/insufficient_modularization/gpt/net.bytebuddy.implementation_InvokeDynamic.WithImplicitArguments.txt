    "justification": "Class shows no sign of insufficient modularization when considered in isolation: small size (LOC=33), no methods or fields (NOM=0, NOF=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 and the absence of methods/complex logic indicate no internal complexity or size that would justify further decomposition."
