    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a monolithic, undecomposed class: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted methods complexity (wmc) = 0 show no concentrated implementation logic; fan-in = 0 and fan-out = 0 indicate no coupling that would suggest hidden responsibilities; number of fields (nof) = 6 is small and LCOM = -1.0 does not suggest poor cohesion in the available data. Although LOC = 139 is moderate, it is not accompanied by method or complexity metrics that would justify flagging Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
