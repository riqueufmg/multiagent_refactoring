    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Delegator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a large size (loc = 182) and a relatively high number of fields (nof = 7), which suggests multiple responsibilities or state slices that could be separated. It also depends on multiple distinct concepts (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), indicating mixed concerns. These factors (high LOC, several fields, diverse dependencies) justify refactoring into smaller, more focused classes."
