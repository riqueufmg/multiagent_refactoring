    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=15, nom=2, wmc=2. Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0). No incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is a single dependency (org.gradle.work.ChangeType). These metrics indicate the class is already small and cohesive, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
