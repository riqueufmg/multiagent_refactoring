    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, non-complex class: LOC=25, NOF=0, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. There are no fields or methods to decompose and no dependencies or coupling that suggest hidden complexity. LCOM is -1.0 (no cohesion data), but overall size and complexity metrics provide no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or would benefit from further decomposition."
