    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 730) while exposing very few structural elements (nom = 0, nopm = 0, nof = 4), indicating a disproportionate amount of code concentrated in a single class rather than split into smaller units. The combination of high LOC and near-zero method counts suggests the class contains substantial implementation that could be decomposed. Low or anomalous cohesion/complexity metrics (lcom = -1.0, wmc = 0) together with zero fan-in/fan-out imply the class is monolithic in isolation and not organized into cohesive, smaller modules. These indicators collectively point to Insufficient Modularization."
