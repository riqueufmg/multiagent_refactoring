    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.RedefinitionStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected due to very large size and many features concentrated in one class: loc = 2097 and nof = 77 indicate a large, feature-rich implementation that is a candidate for decomposition. The absence of method-level decomposition metrics (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and an unclear cohesion value (lcom = -1.0) reinforce that the class is not clearly modularized in the provided data. These elements together suggest Insufficient Modularization."
