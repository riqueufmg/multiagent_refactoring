    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=39), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (dit=0) and effectively no cohesion concerns in the provided metrics (lcom=-1.0). These elements indicate the class is already small and simple and does not require further decomposition."
