    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=51, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=0, weighted method count (wmc)=0. Coupling and dependencies are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). Inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1) and cohesion metric is not signalling fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). Given the absence of methods/fields and low complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
