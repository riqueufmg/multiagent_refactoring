    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy.ManifestReading",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 196) combined with many fields (nof = 10) while reporting zero methods (nom = 0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc = 0) — this suggests a single class carrying substantial state or inline logic that could be split. Shallow inheritance depth (dit = 1) and zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) indicate responsibilities are concentrated inside this class rather than distributed, and the anomalous cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) does not contradict the need for decomposition. Based on these elements taken in isolation, the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
