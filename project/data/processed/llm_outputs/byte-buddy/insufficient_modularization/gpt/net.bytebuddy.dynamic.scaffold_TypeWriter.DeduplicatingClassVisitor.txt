    "justification": "Class size and complexity are minimal: LOC = 29 and WMC = 0 indicate a small, low-complexity implementation. No fields or methods are reported (nof = 0, nom = 0), and cohesion metric is not showing fragmentation (LCOM = -1.0). Coupling is low (fanout = 0, fanin = 0) with a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader). Given the small size, low complexity, and low coupling when analyzed in isolation, there is no evidence that the class has not been completely decomposed or that further decomposition is warranted."
