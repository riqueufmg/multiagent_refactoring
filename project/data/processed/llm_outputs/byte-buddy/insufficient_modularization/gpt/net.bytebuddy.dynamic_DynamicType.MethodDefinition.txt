        "Very large implementation size: loc = 863, which strongly indicates the class contains many lines of code and likely multiple responsibilities that could be split into smaller modules.",
        "Multiple external responsibilities suggested by many dependencies (10 dependencies, e.g. net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender), implying the class interacts with diverse concerns that can be modularized.",
        "Mismatch between size and simple member counts: only 3 fields (nof = 3) and zero reported methods (nom = 0) alongside a high LOC suggests internal complexity (possibly large nested logic or many inner types) rather than a compact, cohesive single responsibility — a sign that further decomposition would reduce complexity."
