    "justification": "No evidence of Insufficient Modularization: class size is modest (loc=50) and it has only a few fields (nof=3). There are no methods recorded (nom=0, nopm=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no listed dependencies. These metrics indicate low complexity and responsibility concentration, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
