    "justification": "Class has small size (loc=26), no methods or fields reported (nom=0, nof=0), zero measured complexity (wmc=0), and very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only two listed dependencies. These indicators show the class is already small and simple and does not present signs of being insufficiently modularized or needing further decomposition."
