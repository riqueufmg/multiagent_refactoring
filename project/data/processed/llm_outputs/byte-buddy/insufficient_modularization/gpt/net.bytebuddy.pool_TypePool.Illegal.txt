    "justification": "The class is very small and not complex: LOC=28, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is 0. These metrics indicate there is no evidence of a large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition."
