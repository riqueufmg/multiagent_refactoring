    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and low-complexity. Metrics show LOC=55, WMC=0, only 2 fields and 0 methods, DIT=1. Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence of a large, monolithic implementation or high complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
