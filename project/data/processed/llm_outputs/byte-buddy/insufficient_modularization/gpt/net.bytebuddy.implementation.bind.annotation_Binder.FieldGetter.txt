    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC=64 (small), WMC=0 and NOM=0 (no method complexity or method count), NOF=4 (few fields), DIT=1 (shallow hierarchy), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). Given the low size, no internal complexity, and lack of coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
