    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: loc is moderate (79), number of methods (nom) = 0 and WMC = 0 indicate no concentrated implementation complexity to split; number of fields (nof) = 3 is low; coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0); inheritance depth (dit = 1) is shallow; cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) indicates good cohesion. Based on these metrics in isolation, further decomposition is not justified."
