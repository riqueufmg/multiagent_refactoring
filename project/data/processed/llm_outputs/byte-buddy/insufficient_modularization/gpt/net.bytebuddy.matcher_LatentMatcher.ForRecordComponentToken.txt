    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC = 22, WMC = 0, NOM = 0, NOF = 1. Low size (22 lines) and zero measured method complexity indicate there is no substantial internal responsibility to decompose further. Fan-in = 0 and fan-out = 0 show minimal coupling; DIT = 1 indicates shallow inheritance. Given these metrics, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
