    "justification": "No smell detected: class is small (loc=55), has very low complexity (wmc=0), no methods reported (nom=0), few fields (nof=2), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Cohesion metric does not indicate decomposition need (lcom=-1.0). Dependencies are limited. These metrics do not suggest the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
