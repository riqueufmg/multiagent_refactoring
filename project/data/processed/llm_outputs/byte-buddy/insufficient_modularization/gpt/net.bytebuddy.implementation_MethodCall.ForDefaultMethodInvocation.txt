    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC = 42 (moderate size), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods and no measured complexity to decompose), single field (NOF = 1) and no measured coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given the absence of methods and low complexity/size, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
