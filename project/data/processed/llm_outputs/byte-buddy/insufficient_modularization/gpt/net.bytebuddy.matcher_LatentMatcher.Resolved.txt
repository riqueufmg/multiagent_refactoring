    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=23, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0. It has minimal inheritance depth (DIT=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and a highly cohesive LCOM=-1.0. With no methods to split and only two external dependencies, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
