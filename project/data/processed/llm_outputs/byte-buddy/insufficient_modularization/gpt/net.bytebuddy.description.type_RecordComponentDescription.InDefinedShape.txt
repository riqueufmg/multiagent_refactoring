    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription.InDefinedShape",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and lacks internal complexity or size that would indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=30, WMC=0, number of methods=0, number of fields=0. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and thus no evidence that a large, multifaceted responsibility exists that should be split. The DIT=2 shows inheritance depth but does not imply the class is large or complex. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no justification to mark this class as insufficiently modularized."
