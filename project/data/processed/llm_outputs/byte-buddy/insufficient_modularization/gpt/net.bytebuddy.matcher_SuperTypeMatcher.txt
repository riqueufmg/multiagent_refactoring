    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.SuperTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: LOC 26, 3 methods (nom 3) with 2 public methods (nopm 2), low cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC 3) and a single field (nof 1). Cohesion is high (LCOM 0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin 0, fanout 0) with only a few dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already cohesive and simple, so there is no evidence it requires further decomposition."
