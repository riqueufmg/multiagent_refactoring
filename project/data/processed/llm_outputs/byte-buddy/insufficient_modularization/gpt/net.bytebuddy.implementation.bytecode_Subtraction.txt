    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=46, NOM=3, NOF=2 and WMC=3 indicate low size and low implementation complexity. Coupling is negligible (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies count=2), so there is no evidence that decomposition would reduce cross-class complexity. LCOM=0.6667 shows a moderate cohesion concern, but given the overall small size and low method/complexity counts, the class does not meet the threshold for Insufficient Modularization."
