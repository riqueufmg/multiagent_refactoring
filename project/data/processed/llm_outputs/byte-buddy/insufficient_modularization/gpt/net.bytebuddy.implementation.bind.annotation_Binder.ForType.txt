    "justification": "The class does not show characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=41), only 1 field (nof=1), no methods reported (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric is not indicative of fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). The limited dependencies (TypeDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) do not imply internal complexity requiring decomposition. Therefore no further modularization is warranted."
