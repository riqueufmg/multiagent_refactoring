        "Small size: LOC = 39, indicating the class is not large and unlikely to require further decomposition.",
        "No behavioral complexity: NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods / no measured complexity) — no internal functionality to split.",
        "Minimal state: NOF = 2 (only two fields) and NOPM = 0, suggesting the class holds little data and does not encapsulate multiple responsibilities.",
        "Low coupling: FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 with a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin), implying limited external interactions that would motivate modularization.",
        "Inheritance depth is shallow (DIT = 1) and LCOM = -1.0 gives no indication of fragmented cohesion that would require decomposition."
