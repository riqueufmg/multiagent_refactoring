    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class examined in isolation shows no signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC = 41), no declared methods (nom = 0) and zero weighted method complexity (WMC = 0) indicate low implementation complexity; low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only two explicit dependencies reduce the likelihood that the class should be further decomposed. DIT = 1 and LCOM = -1.0 do not indicate cohesion problems. Therefore, further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided metrics."
