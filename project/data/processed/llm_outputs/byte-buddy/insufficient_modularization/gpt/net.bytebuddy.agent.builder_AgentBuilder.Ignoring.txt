    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Ignoring",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=31, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0, DIT=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate the class is already small/cohesive and does not show signs that it must be further decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
