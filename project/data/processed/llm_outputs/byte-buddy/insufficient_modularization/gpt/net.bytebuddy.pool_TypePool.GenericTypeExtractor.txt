    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.GenericTypeExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely case of Insufficient Modularization due to its large size (loc = 600) and relatively high number of fields (nof = 17), indicating multiple responsibilities or state. The combination of large LOC with zero reported methods (nom = 0) and zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) implies a monolithic, self-contained implementation rather than small, cohesive components. The cohesion metric is not clearly positive (lcom = -1.0), further supporting that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from refactoring into smaller, focused classes."
