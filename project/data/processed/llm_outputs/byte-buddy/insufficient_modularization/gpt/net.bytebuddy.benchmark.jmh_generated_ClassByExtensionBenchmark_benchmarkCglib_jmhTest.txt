    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_benchmarkCglib_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class appears insufficiently modular: it contains an extremely large number of fields (nof = 263) while only exposing a small number of methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) and occupies substantial source size (loc = 276). Its weighted method complexity is relatively high (wmc = 42) for the small method count, indicating concentrated complexity. The class has no children (nc = 0) and no external coupling reported (fanin/fanout = 0), suggesting a single monolithic type holding many elements rather than being decomposed. Taken together — very high field count, sizable LOC, and elevated WMC — indicate that further decomposition into smaller classes/components would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
