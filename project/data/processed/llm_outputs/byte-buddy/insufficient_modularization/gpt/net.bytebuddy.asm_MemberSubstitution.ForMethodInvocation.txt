    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMethodInvocation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc: 189) while having a non-trivial number of fields (nof: 9) and no reported methods (nom: 0), which indicates substantial implementation not decomposed into smaller units. The presence of multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) further suggests the class is handling multiple concerns. These factors together point to insufficient modularization and recommend further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
