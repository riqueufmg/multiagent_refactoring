    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class: LOC=76 (small), NOM=8 and NOPM=7 (moderate number of methods), WMC=8 (moderate complexity), LCOM=0.375 (acceptable/high cohesion). No public fields (NOPF=0) and low size/complexity suggest the class is sufficiently modular and does not require further decomposition."
