    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: loc = 279 (large size) while nom = 0 and nopm = 0 (no methods reported), and nof = 14 (many fields). A high LOC combined with zero methods indicates the implementation is not decomposed into smaller methods/components, increasing size and likely complexity. Other metrics (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) show isolation but do not mitigate the large internal size, so insufficient modularization is detected."
