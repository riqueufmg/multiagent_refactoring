    "justification": "Metrics show a small, low-complexity class: LOC=13, NOM=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods (nom=0) and no measured complexity, and coupling is minimal (only 2 listed dependencies). These indicators do not demonstrate an undecomposed or overly large/complex class, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
