    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension.AttributeAppendingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no evidence of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=48), low complexity (WMC=0), no methods (NOM=0) and only 4 fields (NOF=4). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no metric indicating excessive responsibility or large implementation to decompose. The listed dependencies do not by themselves imply the class is doing too much. Therefore no insufficient-modularization smell is detected when the class is considered in isolation."
