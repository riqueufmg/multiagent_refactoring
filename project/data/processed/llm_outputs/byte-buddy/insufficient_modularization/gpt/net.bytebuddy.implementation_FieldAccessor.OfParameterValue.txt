    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small size (loc=56), zero methods (nom=0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0) show there is no large implementation to decompose; low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only three listed dependencies reduce signs of multiple responsibilities. No metric evidence (high LOC, high WMC, many methods, or high fan-out) suggests this class requires further decomposition."
