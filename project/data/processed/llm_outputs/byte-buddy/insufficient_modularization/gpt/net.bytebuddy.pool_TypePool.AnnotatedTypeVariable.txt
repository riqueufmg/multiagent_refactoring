    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.AnnotatedTypeVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=46), very low complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0) to decompose, only two fields (nof=2), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no inheritance depth (dit=0). These elements show the class is small and simple, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
