    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess.OffsetIncrementing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (loc=29), no methods reported (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few external dependencies are listed. These metrics indicate the class is already simple and not a candidate for further decomposition."
