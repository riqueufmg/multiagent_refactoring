    "justification": "The class is small and has minimal complexity: LOC=31, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods (NOM=0) and only a single field, indicating no multiple responsibilities to decompose. Given these metrics and no dependencies, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
