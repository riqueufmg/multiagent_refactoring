    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Resolved",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 534) and a high number of fields (nof = 19) which indicate multiple responsibilities or state groupings within a single class. The class depends on a wide variety of distinct concerns (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType), suggesting it handles multiple orthogonal responsibilities (method/field/type/annotation handling, bytecode/ASM operations, assignment/stack manipulation). The metrics also show no recorded methods (nom = 0) and an indeterminate cohesion value (lcom = -1.0), which together with the large LOC and many fields point to a lack of decomposition into smaller, cohesive classes or modules."
