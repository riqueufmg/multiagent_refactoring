    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.UrlDefinitionAction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 141) combined with zero declared methods (nom = 0) while holding multiple fields (nof = 8) suggests behavior and implementation are not decomposed into smaller methods or classes. WMC = 0 and LCOM = -1.0 indicate no modular method structure to distribute complexity. The class is also isolated by fanin = 0 and fanout = 0, implying internal complexity isn't split into collaborating components. These elements (loc=141, nom=0, nof=8, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0) justify flagging insufficient modularization."
