    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyPlugin.JavaPluginConfigurationAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=39), only one field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC=0). Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is zero (DIT=0). These metrics indicate the class is simple and not a large, monolithic unit that would benefit from further decomposition."
