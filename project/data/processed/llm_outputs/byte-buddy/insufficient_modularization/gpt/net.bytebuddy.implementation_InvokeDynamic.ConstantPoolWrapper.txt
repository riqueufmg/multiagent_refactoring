    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ConstantPoolWrapper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc=177) while exposing only 3 fields (nof=3) and no declared methods (nom=0), which suggests substantial implementation content that has not been split into smaller units. It also depends on a diverse set of external types (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.enumeration.EnumerationDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType), indicating multiple responsibilities. Although wmc=0 and lcom=-1.0 are not decisive, the combination of high LOC and multiple dependencies supports that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
