    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=31, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. It has no methods (no behavioral complexity) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 (not indicating low cohesion here). Given the lack of size, complexity, or coupling, there is no evidence this class requires further decomposition."
