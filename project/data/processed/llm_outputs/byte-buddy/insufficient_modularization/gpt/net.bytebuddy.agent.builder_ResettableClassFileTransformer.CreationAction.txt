    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=18), no methods or fields recorded (nom=0, nof=0), zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC=0), no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is not indicating cohesion issues. Although there are listed type usages, the class metrics indicate it is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
