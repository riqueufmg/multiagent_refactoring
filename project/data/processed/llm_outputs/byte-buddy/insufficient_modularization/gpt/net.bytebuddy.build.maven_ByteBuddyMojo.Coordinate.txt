    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has low size and complexity: LOC=34, WMC=0, NOM=0. It contains only 2 fields (NOF=2) and no methods (NOM=0), indicating it is a simple data holder. Coupling is minimal (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, dependencies=[]). Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or that further decomposition is needed."
