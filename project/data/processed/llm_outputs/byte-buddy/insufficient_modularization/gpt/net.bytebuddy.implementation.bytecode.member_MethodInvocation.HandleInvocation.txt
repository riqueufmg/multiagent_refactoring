    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=34, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=3 (only three fields). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no complex metrics suggesting high cohesion problems (LCOM=-1.0). Given its small size, lack of methods/complexity and low coupling, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
