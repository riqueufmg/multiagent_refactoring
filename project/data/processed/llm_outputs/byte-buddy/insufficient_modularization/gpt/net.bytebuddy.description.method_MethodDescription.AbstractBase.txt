    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very high lines of code (loc = 479) while reporting no declared methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) — indicating a large body that has not been decomposed into smaller methods or collaborators; multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType) suggesting the class touches many concerns and responsibilities; non-trivial inheritance depth (dit = 2) which can encourage accumulation of behavior instead of delegation; and a cohesion indicator (lcom = -1.0) that does not contradict low cohesion. Taken in isolation, these elements justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition into smaller, more focused modules or helper classes."
