    "justification": "The class has a high size (loc = 109) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and only 3 fields (nof = 3), indicating substantial code content that is not organized into smaller method-level units; it depends on multiple distinct external types (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator), suggesting multiple responsibilities; given the large LOC combined with lack of method decomposition, further decomposition into smaller classes or methods would likely reduce size and complexity."
