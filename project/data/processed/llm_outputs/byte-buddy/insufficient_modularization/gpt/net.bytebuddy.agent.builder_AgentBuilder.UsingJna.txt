    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: very small size (LOC=18), no methods or fields (NOM=0, NOF=0), zero measured complexity (WMC=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). LCOM=-1.0 is not meaningful with no methods. There is no evidence of large size or high implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
