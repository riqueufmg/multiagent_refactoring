    "justification": "Class is small and contains no behavioral complexity that would indicate an undecomposed responsibility: LOC=36, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=2. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no methods to further split. Although it references several types (dependencies), in isolation the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further modularization."
