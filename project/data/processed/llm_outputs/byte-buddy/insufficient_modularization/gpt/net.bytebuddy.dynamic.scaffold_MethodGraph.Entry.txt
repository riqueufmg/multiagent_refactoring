    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Entry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and holding many responsibilities: LOC = 463 (large size) and NOF = 17 (many fields). These values indicate substantial state and likely multiple concerns that could be split. The class also references multiple external concepts (MethodGraph, MethodDescription, Visibility, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), suggesting it ties together varied functionality. Given the high LOC combined with many fields, the Entry class is a candidate for further decomposition (Insufficient Modularization)."
