    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.DecoratingDynamicTypeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 36) with almost all methods exposed (nopm = 33) indicating a large public API surface, substantial size (loc = 323), high complexity (wmc = 36) and many fields (nof = 15). Together these metrics suggest the class is handling multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
