    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.RedefinitionDynamicTypeBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. It is small (loc=62) with few methods (nom=4, nopm=1), low complexity (wmc=4), shallow inheritance (dit=1) and indicates good cohesion (lcom=-1.0). It has no reported fan-in or fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0), suggesting limited internal coupling. These metrics imply the class is already concise and focused, so further decomposition is not indicated."
