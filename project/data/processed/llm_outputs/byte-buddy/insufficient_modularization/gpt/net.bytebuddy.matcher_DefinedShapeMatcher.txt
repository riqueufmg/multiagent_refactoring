    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=27, NOM=3, WMC=3, NOF=1. Low complexity and size (WMC and LOC) do not indicate a need for further decomposition. High cohesion (LCOM=0.0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) show responsibilities are focused and dependencies are minimal. DIT=0 and small number of methods/fields imply no internal complexity that would benefit from splitting."
