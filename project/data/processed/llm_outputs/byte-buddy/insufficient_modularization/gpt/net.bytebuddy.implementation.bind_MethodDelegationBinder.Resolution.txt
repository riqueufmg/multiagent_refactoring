    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that is too large or complex: LOC=47, NOM=0, NOF=1, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no dependencies listed and cohesion metric is not informative (LCOM=-1.0). Given the small size, minimal fields/methods and lack of complexity or coupling, there is no evidence that this class requires further decomposition."
