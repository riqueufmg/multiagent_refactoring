    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and already highly cohesive/low complexity: LOC=22, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. LCOM=-1.0 indicates strong cohesion. Coupling is negligible (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the lack of methods, low size, and low complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
