    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 46, number of methods = 5, WMC = 5 (low cyclomatic/implementation complexity), number of fields = 1, LCOM = 0.6 (no strong lack of cohesion), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no broad coupling). Dependencies are limited to a single type (ModifierContributor). These metrics indicate the class is sufficiently small/cohesive and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
