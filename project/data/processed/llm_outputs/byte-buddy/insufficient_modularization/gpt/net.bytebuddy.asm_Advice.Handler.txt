    "justification": "Metrics do not show signs of an under-decomposed class: LOC=75 (small), number of fields nof=2, number of methods nom=0, WMC=0 (no measured complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion alarm), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no measured coupling). While a list of dependency types is provided, the coupling metrics are zero. Taken in isolation, there is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would indicate Insufficient Modularization."
