    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: loc=43, nof=3, nom=0, wmc=0, dit=1. There are no methods to decompose (nom=0) and cyclomatic/implementation complexity is zero (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its small size, low complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or would benefit from further decomposition."
