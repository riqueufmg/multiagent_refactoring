    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC = 48, WMC = 0, no methods or public fields (nom = 0, nopm = 0). Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and there are only two external dependencies. LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate poor cohesion given the lack of methods/fields. Based on these elements considered in isolation, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
