    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.DifferentialMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=47, number of fields (nof)=3, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted methods complexity (wmc)=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited to two known types. LCOM=-1.0 does not suggest a cohesion problem. Given the low size, zero method complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence in the provided data that this class requires further modularization."
