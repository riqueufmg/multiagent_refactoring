    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small-to-moderate size (LOC=91), modest method count (nom=10, nopm=10) and complexity (WMC=12) rather than an overwhelmingly large class; low LCOM (0.2) indicates good cohesion; only 3 fields (nof=3) so state is limited; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate low coupling. Taken in isolation, there is no strong evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
