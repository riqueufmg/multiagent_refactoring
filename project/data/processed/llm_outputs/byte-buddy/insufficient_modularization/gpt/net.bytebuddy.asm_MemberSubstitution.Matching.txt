    "justification": "Metrics show the class is small and not complex: loc=47, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0, nc=0 and lcom=-1.0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few external dependencies are listed. Given the lack of methods and low complexity/size, there is no evidence that the class has grown large or has multiple responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition."
