    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForCreation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modularized because its implementation size is large (loc: 347) and it has many fields (nof: 14), which indicates substantial internal state and implementation surface that can be further decomposed. It also depends on a broad and diverse set of concerns (examples: net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter, net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType, net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion). This breadth of dependencies suggests the class coordinates multiple responsibilities (code generation, bytecode reading/writing, type/init handling, attribute/filtering), making it a candidate for decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
