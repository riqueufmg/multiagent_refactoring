    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForShortConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=28, no methods (nom=0), a single field (nof=1) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are only a few external dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or that it requires further decomposition."
