    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: loc=30, nom=3, wmc=3 indicating low complexity, and lcom=0.0 indicating high cohesion. It has no public fields (nopf=0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with no inheritance depth (dit=0). Given its low size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
