    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate no sign of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=36), no methods (nom=0) and no public fields (nopf=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), low inheritance depth (dit=1), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only two external dependencies. These values show the class is small, simple, and not monolithic, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
