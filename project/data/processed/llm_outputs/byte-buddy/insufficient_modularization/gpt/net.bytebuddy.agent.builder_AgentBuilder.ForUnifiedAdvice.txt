    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForUnifiedAdvice",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: LOC = 21, no methods (nom = 0), WMC = 0, only 1 field (nof = 1), and zero coupling indicators (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is large or complex and would benefit from further decomposition."
