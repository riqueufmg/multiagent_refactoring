    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that is too large or complex: loc=59 (small), wmc=0 and nom=0 (no methods contributing to complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling evidence), dependencies minimal (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although nof=7 (fields), the absence of methods and low overall size suggest no clear need for further decomposition. LCOM=-1.0 (no meaningful cohesion data) does not provide evidence of multiple responsibilities. Therefore there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
