    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.SyntheticState",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=46, WMC=5, NOM=5, NOF=1. Low coupling/interaction (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). Cohesion (LCOM=0.8) does not indicate severe mixed responsibilities. These metrics do not suggest the class has not been decomposed; further modularization is not warranted based on the provided data."
