    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeReferenceAdjustment.TypeReferenceClassVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High likelihood of Insufficient Modularization: the class is very large (loc = 408) while having a nontrivial number of fields (nof = 8) but no declared methods (nom = 0), indicating a monolithic implementation that has not been decomposed into smaller responsibilities. It also depends on multiple external components (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool), which suggests it is handling several concerns that could be split into separate classes or helpers. These elements (loc, nof, nom, and the listed dependencies) justify recommending decomposition/refactoring."
