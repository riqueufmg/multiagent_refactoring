    "justification": "Not detected: class is small and shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized. Metrics indicate LOC=28, NOF=1, NOM=0, NOPM=0, WMC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and only 1 dependency. There are no multiple methods/fields or high complexity/coupling that would justify further decomposition."
