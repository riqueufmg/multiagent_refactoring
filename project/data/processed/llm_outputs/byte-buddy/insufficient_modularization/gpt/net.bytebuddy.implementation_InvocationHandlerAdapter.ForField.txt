    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter.ForField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: modest size (loc=84), very low complexity (wmc=0), no reported methods (nom=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2), high measured cohesion (lcom=-1.0), and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a short dependency list. These metrics indicate the class is small, cohesive, and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not indicated."
