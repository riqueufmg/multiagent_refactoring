    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC = 26, number of methods (nom) = 0, weighted method count (wmc) = 0, number of fields (nof) = 1. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and there is no indication of high implementation complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition. Dependencies are limited (2), providing no evidence of a large, monolithic implementation. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
