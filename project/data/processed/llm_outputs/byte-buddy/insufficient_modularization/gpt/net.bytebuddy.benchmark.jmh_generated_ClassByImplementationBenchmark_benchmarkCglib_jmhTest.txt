    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected: very high number of fields (nof = 263) combined with substantial size (loc = 276) and elevated complexity (wmc = 42). The class has relatively few methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) compared with the large field count, producing a high fields-to-methods ratio that indicates multiple responsibilities or bundled state that could be split. DIT = 0 (no inheritance depth) and a single listed dependency reinforce that functionality appears concentrated in this class. Although lcom = 0.0 suggests internal cohesion among methods, the disproportionate field count and overall complexity justify that the class is not sufficiently modularized and would benefit from decomposition."
