    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.TrivialClassCreationBenchmark_benchmarkJdkProxy_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large number of fields (nof = 263) and relatively large size (loc = 275) indicate it aggregates a lot of state; high implementation complexity (wmc = 42) while having a small number of methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) suggests methods must manage many responsibilities or state; these values (high nof + high loc + high wmc combined with few methods) justify that the class has not been decomposed and could be split into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity. Dependency data does not indicate compensating modular structure."
