    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=46 (small), number of methods=0, WMC=0 (no implementation complexity), nof=1 (single field), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), and only one external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Given the small size, lack of methods/complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
