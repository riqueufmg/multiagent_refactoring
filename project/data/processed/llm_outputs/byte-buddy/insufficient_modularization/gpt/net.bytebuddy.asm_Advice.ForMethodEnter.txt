    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization because it contains a relatively large amount of code (loc = 122) while having very few structural elements (nof = 1 field, nom = 0 methods, wmc = 0). This combination suggests sizable implementation is concentrated in a single unit rather than decomposed. The presence of multiple external dependencies (TypeDescription, MethodDescription, Implementation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) indicates it interacts with several concerns and could benefit from splitting responsibilities into smaller, focused components. LCOM = -1.0 (cohesion not meaningfully measured here) combined with the size supports further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
