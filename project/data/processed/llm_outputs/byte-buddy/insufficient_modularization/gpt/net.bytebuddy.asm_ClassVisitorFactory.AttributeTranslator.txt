    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC=65 (moderate size), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods / no measured complexity), NOF=5 (small number of fields), DIT=1, FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling shown). Dependencies are limited to four types. Given the absence of methods and low complexity/size in isolation, there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization."
