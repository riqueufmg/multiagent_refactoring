    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and not a candidate for further decomposition: loc=11, nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only one listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). The LCOM value (-1.0) does not suggest poor cohesion in this isolated view. There is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
