    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 275) while exposing few methods (nom = 4) and holding a relatively large number of fields (nof = 8) and 2 nested classes (nc = 2), which suggests large/multi-responsibility methods and substantial internal state that could be split. Despite low per-method complexity (wmc = 4) and good cohesion (lcom = -1.0), the overall size indicates insufficient decomposition. The wide set of dependencies (ElementMatcher, MethodComparator, ConstructorComparator, FilterableList, TypeDescription, ByteCodeElement, MethodDescription) suggests the class spans multiple concerns (matching, comparison, representation, filtering) that could be modularized into smaller classes."
