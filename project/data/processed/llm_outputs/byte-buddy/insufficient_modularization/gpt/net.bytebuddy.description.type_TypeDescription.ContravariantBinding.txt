    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=28, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), single field (nof=1), and zero complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited (TypeList, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Given the lack of size, methods, or internal complexity to decompose, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
