    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.Appender",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Moderate size (loc = 77) combined with multiple instance fields (nof = 5) and zero declared methods (nom = 0) indicates the class holds substantial state and likely performs multiple responsibilities within a single unit (e.g. large constructor/initializer or inlined logic). The class also references many external types (7 listed dependencies), suggesting it interacts with varied concerns. These elements (loc, nof, nom, and the dependency set) point to a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
