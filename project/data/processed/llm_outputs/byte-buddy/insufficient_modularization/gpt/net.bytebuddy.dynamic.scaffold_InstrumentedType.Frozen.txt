    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType.Frozen",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large implementation size (loc = 322) that suggests multiple responsibilities or substantial internal complexity that could be split. Its dependency list references many distinct concerns (LoadedTypeInitializer, TypeInitializer, TypeList, FieldDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, RecordComponentDescription), indicating it handles type, field, method and initialization responsibilities together. Despite having few fields (nof = 2) and no reported methods, the high LOC combined with multiple functional dependencies is a strong indicator that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
