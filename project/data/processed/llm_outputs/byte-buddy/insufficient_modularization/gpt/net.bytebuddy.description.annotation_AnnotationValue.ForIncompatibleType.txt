    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC is modest (82), number of methods (nom) = 0 and WMC = 0 (no internal complexity), number of fields (nof) = 2 (small), fan-in = 0 and fan-out = 0 (low coupling), and only a few dependencies. LCOM = -1.0 does not signal cohesion problems in the provided data. Given the absence of large size, high method count, or high complexity, there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
