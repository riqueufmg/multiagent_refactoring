    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=23, number of methods (nom)=1, non-private methods (nopm)=1, WMC=3 (low complexity), no fields (nof=0), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), DIT=0. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition."
