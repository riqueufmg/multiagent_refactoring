    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), low complexity (wmc=0), and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LOC=82 is moderate, the absence of methods and low complexity provide no evidence of a large, multifaceted implementation that requires further decomposition. Dependencies are limited and do not imply extra internal responsibility. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected in isolation."
