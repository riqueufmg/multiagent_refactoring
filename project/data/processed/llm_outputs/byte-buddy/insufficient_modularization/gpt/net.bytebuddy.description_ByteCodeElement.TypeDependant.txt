    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement.TypeDependant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very low size and complexity: LOC=18, WMC=0, no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it only depends on its enclosing ByteCodeElement. These metrics indicate the class is small and simple, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization (no need for further decomposition)."
