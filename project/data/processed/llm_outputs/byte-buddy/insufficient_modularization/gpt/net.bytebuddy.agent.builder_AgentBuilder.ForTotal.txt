    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal structure to decompose: LOC=13, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0. No fields, no methods, no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. LCOM is -1.0 (no cohesion data) but given the absence of members and low complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
