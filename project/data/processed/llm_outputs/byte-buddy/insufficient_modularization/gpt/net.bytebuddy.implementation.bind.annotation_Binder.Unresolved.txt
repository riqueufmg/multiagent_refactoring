    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that needs decomposition: LOC=25, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods or fields to decompose and coupling is minimal (one listed dependency). Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
