    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undersized or overly complex class that would benefit from further decomposition: LOC is moderate (55), number of fields is small (nof=3), there are no methods recorded (nom=0) and weighted method complexity is zero (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric is not indicating fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). Dependency list is short (3 dependencies). These elements together suggest the class is not insufficiently modularized in isolation."
