    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ModuleToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: it has modest size (loc=78), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0), indicating it is a simple data holder rather than a large undecomposed unit. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription). These metrics do not justify further decomposition."
