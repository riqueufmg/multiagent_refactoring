    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Analyzed in isolation, the class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 41, number of methods (nom) = 0, WMC = 0, number of fields = 2. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, DIT = 0). The low size and complexity (and absence of methods) indicate no excessive responsibility or implementation complexity that would justify splitting the class."
