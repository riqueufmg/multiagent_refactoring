    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=49, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies count=2) and cohesion metric is non-indicative (LCOM=-1.0). Given low size, no methods, and low complexity/coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
