    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Hierarchical",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=36), no methods (nom=0), zero cyclomatic/weight complexity (wmc=0), no coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only two listed dependencies. These elements show the class is small and not overly complex, so there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
