    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=44, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and depth of inheritance=1. LCOM is -1.0 (no cohesion issues indicated for an empty/simple class). Given the low size, zero method complexity, and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
