    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.MethodCallProxy.PrecomputedMethodGraph",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), and zero cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc=0). Its size is small (loc=47) and fanin/fanout are 0, indicating little internal behavior to decompose. Although a few external types are referenced, the absence of methods and low complexity metrics do not justify further decomposition."
