    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyTokenList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively high number of fields (nof = 10) and a moderate size (loc = 108) while declaring no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0). This pattern indicates a large data holder that aggregates many attributes/concerns without behavioral decomposition. Given these metrics (high field count + nontrivial LOC vs. zero methods) and the presence of multiple dependencies, further decomposition into smaller, focused classes would likely reduce size and improve modularity."
