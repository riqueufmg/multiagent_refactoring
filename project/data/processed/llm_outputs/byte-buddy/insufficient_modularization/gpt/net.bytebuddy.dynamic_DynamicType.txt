    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 4937) and a large number of fields (nof = 68) indicate substantial implementation content that can be split. The class also exposes many distinct inner-types / responsibilities (e.g. DynamicType.Builder, Default, AbstractBase, Simple, Valuable, Initial, ImplementationDefinition, FieldDefinition, MethodDefinition, RecordComponentDefinition, InnerTypeDefinition, ParameterDefinition, ExceptionDefinition, ModuleDefinition, RequiresDefinition, OpensDefinition, ExportsDefinition, TypeVariableDefinition, ReceiverTypeDefinition) as shown in the dependency list, which implies multiple responsibilities consolidated in one top-level class. Although the method count is modest (nom = 16), the presence of numerous nested definitions and many domain-specific collaborators (various attribute appenders, registries, scaffold classes, loading/strategy classes) indicates the class is acting as a container for many concerns. These elements together justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
