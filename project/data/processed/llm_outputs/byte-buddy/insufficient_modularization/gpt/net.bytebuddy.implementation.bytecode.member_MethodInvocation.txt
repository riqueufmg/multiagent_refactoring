    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=371) combined with a small number of methods (nom=4) implies very large, multi-responsibility methods; moderate complexity (wmc=9) and high field count (nof=12) indicate substantial internal state and logic. Cohesion is reduced (lcom=0.75), suggesting multiple responsibilities that are not tightly related. The dependency list includes several distinct inner/related types (WithImplicitInvocationTargetType, HandleType, IllegalInvocation) and many external concepts (Implementation, JavaConstant, TypeList, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, ClassFileVersion, JavaType), implying the class handles multiple concerns (invocation handling, handle types, error handling, type/constant representation). Taken in isolation, these factors justify decomposing the class into smaller, more cohesive units."
