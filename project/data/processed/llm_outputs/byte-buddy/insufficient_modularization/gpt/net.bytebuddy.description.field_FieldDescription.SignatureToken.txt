    "justification": "Class considered in isolation shows no sign of insufficient modularization: size is small (loc = 54), it has no methods (nom = 0) and zero measured complexity (wmc = 0), only two fields (nof = 2), minimal coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only two external dependencies. These elements indicate the class is already simple and does not require further decomposition."
