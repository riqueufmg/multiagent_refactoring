    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.PropertyDelegate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a very large size (loc = 392) while reporting no fields (nof = 0) and no methods (nom = 0), indicating a long, undivided implementation body. Coupled with zero fan-in and fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and no declared dependencies, the provided metrics suggest the class has not been decomposed into smaller, cohesive units or helper members — symptoms of Insufficient Modularization."
