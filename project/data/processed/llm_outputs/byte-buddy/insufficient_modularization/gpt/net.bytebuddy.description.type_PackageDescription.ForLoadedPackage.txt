    "justification": "False: the class shows no signs of Insufficient Modularization. Metrics indicate a very small, simple class (loc=28) with a single field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0), no measured complexity (wmc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList). In isolation there are no large methods, high complexity, or multiple responsibilities that suggest further decomposition."
