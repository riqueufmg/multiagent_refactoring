    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkCglib_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and complex to remain monolithic: very high number of features/elements (nof = 263) and large size (loc = 276) indicate heavy implementation volume; high cyclomatic/weight metric (wmc = 42) indicates substantial internal complexity. Although method count is moderate (nom = 9) and LCOM = 0.0 implies those methods are cohesive, the overall size and element count (nof = 263) together with elevated WMC justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
