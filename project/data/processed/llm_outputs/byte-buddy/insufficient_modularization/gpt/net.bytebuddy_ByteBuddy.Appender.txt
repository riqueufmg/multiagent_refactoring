    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc = 38), no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and minimal state (nof = 1) indicate limited responsibilities. Complexity metrics are minimal (wmc = 0) and cohesion is high (lcom = -1.0). Coupling is low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and the listed external dependencies are few and do not imply internal complexity. Given these metrics taken in isolation, there is no evidence the class should be further decomposed."
