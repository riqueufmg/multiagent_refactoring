    "class": "net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy.SuffixingRandom",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has LOC = 131, other metrics indicate low internal complexity and few implementation elements: nof = 1 (one field), nom = 0, nopf = 0, nopm = 0, wmc = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0. The low method count/complexity and zero coupling suggest no evidence of multiple responsibilities or excessive internal complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. Therefore there is insufficient evidence to report Insufficient Modularization."
