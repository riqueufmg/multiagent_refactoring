    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithExceptionHandling",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 99) while showing no recorded method-level decomposition (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and no measured cyclomatic/weighted method complexity (wmc = 0). It declares multiple fields (nof = 3) and depends on several external types (3 dependencies), indicating mixed responsibilities without internal modularization. These elements (high LOC combined with absent method decomposition and multiple dependencies) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
