    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class with no internal decomposition opportunities: loc=45 (small size), nom=0 and nof=0 (no methods or fields to further split), wmc=0 and nc=0 (no measured complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling pressure), and only one external dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner). There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or mixed responsibilities that would indicate the need for further modularization."
