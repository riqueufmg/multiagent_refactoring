    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=48, WMC=0, no methods/fields reported (nof=0, nom=0), LCOM not indicating cohesion issues, fan-in=0 and fan-out=0 with a single external dependency (TypePool). Given low size, zero measured complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that this class requires further decomposition."
