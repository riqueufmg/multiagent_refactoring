    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForInstance",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Given the provided metrics for this class in isolation, there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization. The class has 69 LOC and 4 fields but reports 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), indicating low internal behavioral complexity. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependency list is small. Although LOC is non-zero, the lack of methods and low complexity mean there is no clear sign of multiple responsibilities or a large, monolithic implementation that would benefit from further decomposition. The LCOM value is -1.0 (unreliable/undefined), so it cannot be used to argue for poor cohesion. Therefore, do not detect Insufficient Modularization based on the given data."
