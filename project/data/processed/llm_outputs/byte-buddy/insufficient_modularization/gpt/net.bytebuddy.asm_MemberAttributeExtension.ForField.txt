    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension.ForField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class shows low internal complexity and size (loc=114, nof=3) with no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). It has shallow inheritance (dit=1), no measured coupling in terms of fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0), and dependencies do not imply internal complexity given fanout=0. These metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition."
