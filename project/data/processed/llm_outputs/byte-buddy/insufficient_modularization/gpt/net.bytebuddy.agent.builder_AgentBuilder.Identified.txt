    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and lacks internal complexity: LOC=26, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods or fields to decompose and no coupling or complexity that would suggest further modularization is needed. Therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
