    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: loc=52 (small size), wmc=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods to split), nopf=0, n of fields=5 (moderate), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling pressure). Dependencies are limited (3). Overall the class is small, low-complexity and low-coupling, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
