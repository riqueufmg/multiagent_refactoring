    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.AgentProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 164) combined with no declared methods (nom = 0) and zero measured complexity (wmc = 0) indicates substantial code content not organized into methods/units. It has few fields (nof = 2) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) yet still occupies many lines, suggesting internal implementation that could be decomposed. lcom = -1.0 (cohesion not meaningfully measured) further prevents concluding good internal modularity. Dependency list (net.bytebuddy.agent.Installer) is minimal, reinforcing that the class itself likely contains undivided responsibilities that should be split."
