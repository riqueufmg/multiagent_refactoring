    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, large, or complex class: LOC is 50 (moderate), number of fields = 2, number of methods = 0, WMC = 0 (no internal complexity), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (low coupling). There are only two external dependencies. Given the small field count, lack of methods/complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence that this class needs further decomposition."
