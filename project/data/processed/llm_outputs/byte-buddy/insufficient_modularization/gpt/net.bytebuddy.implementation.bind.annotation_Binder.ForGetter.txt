    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Analyzed in isolation, the class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=34), minimal state (NOF=1), no methods recorded (NOM=0, NOPM=0) and zero complexity (WMC=0). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=0). Dependency list is small and there is no indication of high implementation complexity or a need to decompose responsibilities further."
