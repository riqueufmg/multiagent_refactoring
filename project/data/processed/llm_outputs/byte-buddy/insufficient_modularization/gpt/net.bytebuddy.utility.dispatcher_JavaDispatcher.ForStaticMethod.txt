    "justification": "Class metrics indicate it is small and not complex: loc=40, nof=1, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one external dependency listed. With no methods (nom=0) and negligible complexity, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modular or requires further decomposition."
