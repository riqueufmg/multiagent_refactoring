    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=30, NOM=2 (NOPM=1), single field (NOF=1), low complexity WMC=3, low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single external dependency), DIT=0 and no children. These metrics indicate the class is already small, low-complexity and not doing multiple responsibilities, so it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
