    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.SuppressionHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high source size (loc = 184) indicating substantial implementation contained in a single unit. It maintains state (nof = 5) and references multiple distinct external types (dependencies: TypeDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, StackManipulation, Implementation), suggesting multiple responsibilities. Metric anomalies (nom = 0 and wmc = 0 despite large LOC) and the reported cohesion/structure indicator (lcom = -1.0) point to an irregular, concentrated implementation rather than well-separated components. Together these facts indicate the class is not fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
