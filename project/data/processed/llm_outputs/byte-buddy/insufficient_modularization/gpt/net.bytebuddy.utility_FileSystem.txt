    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large in size (loc = 193) while exposing a small number of methods (nom = 5, nopm = 4), which indicates long methods that could be split. Cohesion is low (lcom = 0.8), suggesting multiple responsibilities within the same class. The presence of multiple nested/related types in the dependency list (net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem.Files, net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem.Dispatcher, net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem.StandardCopyOption) indicates distinct subcomponents are implemented under this single class rather than as separate modules. Together, high LOC, low cohesion, and embedded subcomponents justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
