    "justification": "High size with low decomposition: LOC = 167 while number of methods (nom) = 0 and number of public fields (nopf) = 0, indicating a large class body without clearly separated method-level units. The class holds multiple fields (nof = 4) and depends on many distinct concepts (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter, net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader), which signals multiple responsibilities. Low measured complexity (wmc = 0) and lack of call coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) do not offset the large LOC and cross-cutting dependencies. These factors together indicate insufficient modularization and that further decomposition (extracting distinct responsibilities or helper components) would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
