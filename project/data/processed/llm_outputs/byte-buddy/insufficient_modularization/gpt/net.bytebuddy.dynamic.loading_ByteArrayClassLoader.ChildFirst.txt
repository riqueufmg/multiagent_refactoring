    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.ChildFirst",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size with low decomposition: LOC = 266 indicates a large implementation body that is likely carrying multiple responsibilities. Low method-level metrics (nom = 0, wmc = 0) paired with nontrivial LOC suggests code is not organized into smaller methods/components within the class. Small number of fields (nof = 3) but large LOC implies functionality is concentrated in the class rather than delegated. Dependency set includes multiple loading/strategy-related types (ClassLoaderDecorator, ClassFilePostProcessor, ClassLoadingStrategy, PackageDefinitionStrategy), indicating the class coordinates several concerns that could be separated. Low fanin/fanout (0) and modest inheritance depth (dit = 2) reinforce that behavior is centralized in this single class rather than modularized. These elements collectively justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
