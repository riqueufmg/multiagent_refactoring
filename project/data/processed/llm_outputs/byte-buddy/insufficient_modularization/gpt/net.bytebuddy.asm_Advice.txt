    "justification": "The class exhibits Insufficient Modularization. Evidence: very large size (loc = 11101) and large feature count (nof = 403) indicating a monolithic implementation; many embedded/nested responsibilities shown by numerous inner types referenced (e.g. Advice.AdviceMethodWriter, Advice.AdviceVisitor, Advice.ForTypeName, Advice.ForDefaultValues, Advice.ForThisReference, Advice.ForInstrumentedMethod, Advice.ForMethodEnter, Advice.ForMethodExit, Advice.Dispatcher, Advice.PostProcessor, Advice.Handler, Advice.Inlining, Advice.Relocation, Advice.OffsetMapping, etc.), which implies multiple distinct concerns housed in one class; moderate cyclomatic complexity (wmc = 37) with relatively few declared methods (nom = 24) — suggesting very large/complex methods rather than well-factored small ones; low inheritance depth (dit = 1) and non-zero cohesion (lcom = 0.333) but not high enough to negate the size/role fragmentation. Together these metrics and the large number of specialized inner types indicate the class should be decomposed into smaller, focused classes/modules."
