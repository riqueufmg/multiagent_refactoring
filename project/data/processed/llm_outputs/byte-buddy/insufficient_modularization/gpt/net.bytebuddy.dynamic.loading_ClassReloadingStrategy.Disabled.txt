    "justification": "Not detected: the class is trivial in isolation (LOC=13, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0) with no fan-in/fan-out and no dependencies. With zero methods/fields and negligible size/complexity there is no evidence that it has insufficient modularization or that it can be further decomposed."
