    "justification": "Metrics show a small, low-complexity class: loc=26, nom=4, wmc=4. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is a single external dependency (org.gradle.api.provider.Provider). These values indicate the class is small and cohesive and does not exhibit signs of being insufficiently modularized (no high complexity, large size, or high coupling that would justify further decomposition)."
