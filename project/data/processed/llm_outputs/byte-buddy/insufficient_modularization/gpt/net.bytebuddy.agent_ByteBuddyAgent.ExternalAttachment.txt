    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.ExternalAttachment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: 36 LOC, 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), WMC=0, and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics show low size and complexity and provide no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; there is insufficient indication that further modularization is needed."
