    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: 15 LOC, 2 methods (nom=2), low complexity (WMC=2) and high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). It has no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few external dependencies. There is no indication that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
