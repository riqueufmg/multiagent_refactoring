    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=92 with NOM=1 and WMC=1 shows a single low-complexity behavior; NOF=0 and NC=1 indicate no large internal state or many methods to split; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show low coupling. There is no evidence (many methods, high complexity, or mixed responsibilities) that the class needs further decomposition."
