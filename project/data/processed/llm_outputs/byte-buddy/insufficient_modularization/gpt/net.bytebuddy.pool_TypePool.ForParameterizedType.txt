    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForParameterizedType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected: the class shows signs of insufficient modularization — large size (loc = 241) combined with a high number of fields (nof = 18) while reporting no methods (nom = 0). This indicates substantial state and/or implementation concentrated in a single class rather than being split into smaller, focused units. Internal complexity appears concentrated (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), reinforcing that decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
