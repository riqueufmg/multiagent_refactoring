    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.MethodToken",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (nof=20) and a moderate source size (loc=170) while declaring no methods (nom=0). This combination indicates a large data aggregate likely bundling multiple responsibilities and/or state facets that could be split into smaller, focused types. The absence of methods (nom=0) alongside many fields (nof=20) and non-trivial LOC supports that the class is insufficiently modular and would benefit from decomposition."
