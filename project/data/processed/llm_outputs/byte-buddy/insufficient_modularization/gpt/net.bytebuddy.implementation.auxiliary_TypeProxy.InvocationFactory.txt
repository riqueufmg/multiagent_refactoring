    "justification": "Metrics show the class is not large or complex: LOC=39, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0. Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency: net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). LCOM is -1.0 (not indicating cohesion problems in this data). Given the absence of methods/fields and zero complexity, there is no evidence the class requires further decomposition—Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
