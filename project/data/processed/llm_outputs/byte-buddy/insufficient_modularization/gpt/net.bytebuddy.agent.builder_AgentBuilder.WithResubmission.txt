    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undivided, complex class that would benefit from further decomposition: loc=97 (moderate size), nof=3 (few fields), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods and no measured complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling suggesting hidden responsibilities). lcom=-1.0 provides no evidence of low cohesion. Given the absence of methods and complexity in isolation, there is no clear sign of Insufficient Modularization."
