    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.SetterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=42), very few fields (nof=2), no methods (nom=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is simple and not a candidate for further decomposition."
