    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ExtendedLazyTypeDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 241) combined with zero reported methods (nom = 0) and a non‑trivial number of fields (nof = 7) indicates substantial implementation content that is not decomposed into smaller methods/classes. It also depends on multiple external types (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader), suggesting multiple responsibilities or concerns. The imbalance of high LOC with no methods and multiple dependencies supports that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
