    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show no evidence of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=2), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no reported cohesion issues (lcom=-1.0). Although DIT=4 indicates inheritance depth, the class itself contains no content to decompose. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
