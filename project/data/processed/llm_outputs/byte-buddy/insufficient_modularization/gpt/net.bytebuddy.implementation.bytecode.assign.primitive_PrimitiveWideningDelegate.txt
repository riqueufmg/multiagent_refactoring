    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: high size (loc=178) and complexity (wmc=19) while exposing few methods (nom=3, nopm=2) and holding many fields (nof=10). The fields-to-methods imbalance (10 fields vs 3 methods) and only moderate cohesion (lcom=0.6667) suggest multiple responsibilities or sizable internal logic concentrated in a single class. Fanin and fanout are 0 (isolated), which means the class's internal complexity is not mitigated by interactions; this further supports splitting internal functionality into smaller, focused modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
