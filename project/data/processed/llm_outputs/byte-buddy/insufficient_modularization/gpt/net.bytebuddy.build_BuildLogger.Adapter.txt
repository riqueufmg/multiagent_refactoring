    "justification": "Metrics show 0 fields (nof=0), 0 methods (nom=0), WMC=0 and fan-in/fan-out = 0, indicating no measurable internal complexity or interactions. LOC is 69 but with no methods/fields and LCOM=-1.0 (not indicating cohesion problems) there is no evidence the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
