    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=28, nof=1 field, nom=0 methods, WMC=0 indicating no method complexity. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion issues. Given its low size, complexity, and coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is necessary."
