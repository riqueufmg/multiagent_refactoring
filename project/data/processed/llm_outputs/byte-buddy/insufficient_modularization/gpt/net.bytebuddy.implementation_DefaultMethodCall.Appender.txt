    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.DefaultMethodCall.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: small size (loc=62), no methods (nom=0) and therefore no cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0), low number of fields (nof=3), minimal inheritance depth (dit=1), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition."
