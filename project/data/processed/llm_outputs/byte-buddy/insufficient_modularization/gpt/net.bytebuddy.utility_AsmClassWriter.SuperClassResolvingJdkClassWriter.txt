    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.SuperClassResolvingJdkClassWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show the class is small and low-complexity: loc=39, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=2. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single external dependency: net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not indicate fragmentation of responsibilities. Given the very small size, zero method complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence in the provided data that the class has insufficient modularization or that it requires further decomposition."
