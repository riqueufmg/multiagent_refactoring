    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Graph",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class metrics show no indication of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=29), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (WMC=0), only one field (nof=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and minimal dependencies. These elements indicate the class is already small and simple, so there is no evidence it should be further decomposed."
