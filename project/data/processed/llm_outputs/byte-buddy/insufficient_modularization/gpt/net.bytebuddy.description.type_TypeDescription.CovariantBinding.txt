    "justification": "Class is small and non-complex: LOC=27, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, DIT=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only depends on net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Given its low size, zero method complexity, and negligible coupling, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
