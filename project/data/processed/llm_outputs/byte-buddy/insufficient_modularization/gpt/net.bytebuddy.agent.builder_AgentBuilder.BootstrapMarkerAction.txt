    "justification": "The class is small and non-complex: LOC=13, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOPM=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy). With no methods or fields to decompose and very low complexity and size, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed in isolation."
