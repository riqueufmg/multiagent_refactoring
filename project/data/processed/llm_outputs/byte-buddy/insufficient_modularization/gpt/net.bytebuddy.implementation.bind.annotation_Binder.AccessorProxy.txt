    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization: moderate size (loc=62), very low complexity (wmc=0), no recorded methods (nom=0) so there is no internal procedural complexity to decompose, shallow inheritance (dit=1), and low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). While the class has 6 fields (nof=6), that alone is not sufficient to justify further decomposition in isolation; cohesion metric is unavailable/invalid (lcom=-1.0). Given these values and considering the class in isolation, there is insufficient evidence to detect Insufficient Modularization."
