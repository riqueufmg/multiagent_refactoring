    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=26, NOM=3 (NOPM=2), WMC=3, NOF=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and there are no incoming/outgoing coupling concerns (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no indication that further decomposition is needed."
