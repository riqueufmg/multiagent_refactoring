    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=29, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There is no evidence of high size or implementation complexity that would indicate incomplete decomposition. DIT=2 indicates inheritance depth but not excessive complexity, and listed dependencies (FieldDescription, ByteCodeElement, FilterableList) are few. Overall the provided metrics do not justify Insufficient Modularization."
