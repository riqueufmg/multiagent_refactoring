    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits strong signs of insufficient modularization: extremely large size (loc = 7626) and an unusually high number of fields (nof = 411) while exposing very few methods (nom = 2), indicating many responsibilities/data are concentrated rather than decomposed. The dependency list contains a large number of nested/inner roles (e.g. TypePool.WithIndex, TypePool.ForType, TypePool.ForField, TypePool.ForMethod, TypePool.GenericTypeExtractor, TypePool.CacheProvider, TypePool.LazyTypeDescription, TypePool.AnnotationToken, TypePool.ComponentTypeLocator, etc.), showing many distinct concerns implemented within the same class unit. These metrics (very high LOC and fields combined with numerous inner-type responsibilities) justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
