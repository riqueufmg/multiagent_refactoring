    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.TypeVariableDefinitionAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The class is small (loc=25), has no methods (nom=0) and minimal state (nof=1), very low complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), and no coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics and only two external dependencies, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
