    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large or complex class: LOC is moderate (75), number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted methods complexity (wmc) = 0 showing no internal complexity, number of fields/operations (nof) = 1 and no public members (nopf = 0, nopm = 0). Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and cohesion metric is not indicating a problem (lcom = -1.0). Given these values there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
