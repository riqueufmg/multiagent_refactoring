    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 6597) and contains a very large number of members (nof = 292) while defining many distinct nested/inner roles (dependencies list contains >30 MemberSubstitution.* types such as FieldResolver, Replacement, Dispatcher, ForMatchedField, ForMethodInvocation, ForDynamicInvocation, ForFieldAccess, ForMatchedMethod, ForFieldHandle, ForStackManipulation, Factory, GetterFactory, SetterFactory, Binding, Substitution, Resolved, OffsetMapping, TypePoolResolver, etc.). This concentration of many named subcomponents and responsibilities inside a single top-level class indicates it has not been fully decomposed; despite a moderate method count (nom = 16) and low WMC (16), the huge file size and multiplicity of inner types show multiple responsibilities and implementation complexity that could be reduced by extracting cohesive parts into separate classes/modules."
