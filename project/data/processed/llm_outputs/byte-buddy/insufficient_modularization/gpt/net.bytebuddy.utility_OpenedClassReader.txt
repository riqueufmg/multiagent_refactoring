    "justification": "The class is small and reasonably cohesive: 5 methods (4 public), 4 fields, 90 LOC and WMC=7 (moderate complexity). LCOM=0.4 indicates acceptable cohesion. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and dependencies are limited to three types. There is no evidence of an oversized number of responsibilities or high internal complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
