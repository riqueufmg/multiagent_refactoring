    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 108 LOC, its metrics show no implementation complexity or size indicators that suggest an undecomposed responsibility: nom (number of methods) = 0, wmc = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0. It has 4 fields (nof = 4) but cohesion is not reported (lcom = -1.0), and dependencies are limited. With no methods and no measured complexity or coupling, there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
