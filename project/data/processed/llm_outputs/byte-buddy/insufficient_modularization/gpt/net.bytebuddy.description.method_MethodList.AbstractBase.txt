    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: loc=49 (small size), wmc=0 and nom=0/nopm=0/nopf=0 indicating no detectable method complexity or many responsibilities, nof=0 (no fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), lcom=-1.0 (no evidence of low cohesion). DIT=2 indicates inheritance but does not imply excessive size or complexity. Dependencies are limited to three related types, not indicating a monolithic class. Based on these metrics taken in isolation, Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
