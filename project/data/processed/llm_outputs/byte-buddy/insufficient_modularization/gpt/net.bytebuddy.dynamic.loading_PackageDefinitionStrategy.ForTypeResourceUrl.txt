    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is moderate (67), number of fields is small (nof=6), and there is no measured behavioral complexity (nom=0, wmc=0). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Given the low method/complexity counts and limited size, there is no strong evidence that this class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
