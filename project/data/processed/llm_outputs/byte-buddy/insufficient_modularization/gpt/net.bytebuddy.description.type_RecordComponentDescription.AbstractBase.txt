    "justification": "The class shows no indicators of being too large or complex: LOC = 45 (small), WMC = 0 and NOM = 0 (no method complexity or many methods), NOF = 0 (no fields), FANOUT = 0 and FANIN = 0 (low coupling), and LCOM = -1.0 (no evidence of low cohesion). DIT = 2 is modest inheritance depth but does not imply lack of decomposition. Given the small size, lack of methods/fields, and low complexity/coupling, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
