    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=25, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only a few external dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
