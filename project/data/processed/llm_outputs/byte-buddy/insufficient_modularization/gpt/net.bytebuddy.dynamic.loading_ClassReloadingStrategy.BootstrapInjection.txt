    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy.BootstrapInjection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=46, only 1 field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0), with zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0). Coupling and usage metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0), inheritance depth is zero (dit=0) and LCOM is not indicating cohesion issues (lcom=-1.0). It has only two dependencies. These metrics show low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition (Insufficient Modularization = false)."
