    "justification": "Insufficient modularization not detected: class is small (LOC 42), has no methods (nom 0), very low complexity (WMC 0), single field (nof 1), low coupling (fanin 0, fanout 0) and only two external dependencies. These metrics show no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
