    "justification": "No smell detected: class size and complexity are low (loc=88, wmc=0), it declares no methods (nom=0) and has modest field count (nof=7). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric shows no fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). These metrics provide no evidence that the class is overly large or carrying multiple responsibilities that would require further decomposition."
