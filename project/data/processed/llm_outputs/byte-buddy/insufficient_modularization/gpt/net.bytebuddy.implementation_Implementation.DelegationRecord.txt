    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class shows a small internal surface and low complexity. Metrics — nof: 2, nom: 0, wmc: 0, fanin: 0, fanout: 0 — indicate only two fields, no methods and no measurable complexity or coupling. loc: 76 is moderate but with nom=0 there is no large method body to decompose. lcom: -1.0 suggests high cohesion. Dependencies are limited and specific. Taken in isolation, these elements do not indicate a class that has not been decomposed and therefore do not justify Insufficient Modularization."
