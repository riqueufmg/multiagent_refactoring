    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.InterfaceTypeRegistrant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: loc=11, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), no complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Only a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) is listed. Considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
