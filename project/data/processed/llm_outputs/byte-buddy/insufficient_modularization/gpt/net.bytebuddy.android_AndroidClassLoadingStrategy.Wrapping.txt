    "justification": "Class has small size and complexity: LOC=36, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0. It declares no methods or fields (NOM=0, NOF=0) and has no external dependencies (fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Fan-in is 0 and inheritance depth (DIT=2) does not indicate an overloaded implementation. These metrics indicate the class is already small/simple and does not show signs of insufficient modularization."
