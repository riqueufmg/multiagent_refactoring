    "justification": "Class is small and simple when considered in isolation: 47 LOC, only 2 functions (nof=2), very low complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no external dependencies. These metrics do not indicate that the class has not been decomposed or that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. LCOM value does not suggest cohesion problems in this isolated view."
