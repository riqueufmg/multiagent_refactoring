    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: size is moderate (LOC=118), cyclomatic/weight is moderate (WMC=9), method count is small (NOM=7) and field count is modest (NOF=6). Cohesion is reasonably high (LCOM=0.2857), inheritance depth and children are zero (DIT=0, NC=0), and there is no reported coupling through calls (fanin=0, fanout=0). These values suggest the class is cohesive and not excessively large or complex, so further decomposition is not clearly justified."
