    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and simple: LOC=21, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods or fields to further decompose and no external coupling (dependency only to its outer class). Given the low size and complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
