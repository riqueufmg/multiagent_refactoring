    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.ForJnaWindowsEnvironment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large implementation size (loc = 306) combined with a nontrivial number of fields (nof = 9, nopf = 3) while exposing no methods (nom = 0) and no measured complexity per-method (wmc = 0) indicates the class is monolithic and not decomposed. The absence of fans (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and the presence of many lines without method decomposition imply responsibilities or initialization logic are concentrated in the class body rather than split into smaller classes/methods, so further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
