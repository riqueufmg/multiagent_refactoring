    "justification": "Class is very small and not complex: LOC=35, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0. Low coupling and usage: fanin=0, fanout=0, single external dependency. No methods or significant state to decompose. Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large, or complex class, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
