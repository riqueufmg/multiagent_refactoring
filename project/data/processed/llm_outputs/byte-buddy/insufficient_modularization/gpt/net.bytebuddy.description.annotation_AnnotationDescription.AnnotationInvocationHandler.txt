    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected due to high size and apparent lack of decomposition: loc = 193 (large class text) while nom = 0 (no methods declared), and nof = 7 (several fields) — this combination suggests large, monolithic implementation (likely large method bodies or blocks) rather than multiple smaller cohesive methods/classes. Multiple external dependencies (AnnotationValue, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, AnnotationDescription, CachedReturnPlugin) indicate the class touches several concerns. lcom = -1.0 (low/unknown cohesion) further supports insufficient modularization."
