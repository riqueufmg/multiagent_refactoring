    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=10, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOPM=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods or measurable complexity to decompose; coupling is negligible (single listed dependency). The LCOM value (-1.0) is not indicative of poor cohesion here. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
