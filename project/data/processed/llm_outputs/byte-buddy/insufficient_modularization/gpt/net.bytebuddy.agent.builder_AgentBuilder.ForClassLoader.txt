    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC=65 (small), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods/complexity to decompose), NOF=0/NOPM=0 and fanin=0/fanout=0 (no fields or coupling-driven complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issues reported). Single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) shows minimal coupling. Evaluated in isolation, there is no evidence of size or implementation complexity warranting further modularization."
