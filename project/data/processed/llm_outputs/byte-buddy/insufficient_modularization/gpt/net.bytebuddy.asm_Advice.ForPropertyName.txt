    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=17, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0. It has a single field (NOF=1) and no methods, minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency). These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
