    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=20, NOM=2, WMC=2. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are only two listed dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already simple and cohesive in isolation, so there is no evidence that further decomposition (insufficient modularization) is necessary."
