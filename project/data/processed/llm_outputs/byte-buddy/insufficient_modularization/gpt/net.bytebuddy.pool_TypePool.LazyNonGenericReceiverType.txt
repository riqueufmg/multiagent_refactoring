    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: nof=1, nom=0, loc=51, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). There are no methods and minimal state, indicating low complexity and coupling; no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
