    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc = 161) combined with a relatively large number of fields (nof = 9) suggests multiple responsibilities encapsulated in one class. The cohesion metric is unfavorable (lcom = -1.0), indicating low cohesion among members and supporting further decomposition. The class depends on a variety of unrelated concerns (Binder, Implementation, ParameterDescription, Assigner, AnnotationDescription, BindingMechanic), which implies it handles multiple roles (binding, annotation handling, assignment logic). These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization and recommend splitting responsibilities into smaller, more cohesive classes."
