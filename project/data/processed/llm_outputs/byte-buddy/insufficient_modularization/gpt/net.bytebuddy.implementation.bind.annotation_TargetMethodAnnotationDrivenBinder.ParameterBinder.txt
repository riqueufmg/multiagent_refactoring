    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively large size (loc = 144) while depending on many external components (dependencies list contains 10 distinct types including Binder, Implementation, Assigner, AnnotationDescription, MethodDelegationBinder, FieldLocator, StackManipulation, ConstantValue, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and its outer binder type). The combination of moderate LOC and numerous dependencies suggests it is responsible for multiple concerns and could be further decomposed to reduce size and coupling. Additional supporting metrics: 4 fields and many external collaborators indicate potential for splitting responsibilities into smaller modular units."
