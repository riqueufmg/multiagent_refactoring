    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingUnsafeOverride",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely candidate for Insufficient Modularization because it is relatively large (loc = 246) while containing a moderate number of fields (nof = 6) and effectively no explicit method decomposition in the provided metrics (nom = 0, wmc = 0). The combination of high LOC with zero reported methods suggests a monolithic implementation (large blocks of code or long inline logic) rather than being decomposed into smaller, focused methods or helper classes. Fan-in and fan-out are both 0, indicating the class is self-contained, which reinforces that internal decomposition (splitting responsibilities into smaller modules) could reduce size and implementation complexity."
