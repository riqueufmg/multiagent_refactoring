    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: loc=53, nof=3 fields, nom=0 methods, wmc=0, dit=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not indicate fragmentation. With no methods and low size/complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
