    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.TransformationDispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a substantial size (loc = 150) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and no measured method complexity (wmc = 0), which indicates responsibilities are not decomposed into distinct methods. It also declares multiple fields (nof = 5) suggesting accumulated state. These facts (high LOC combined with 0 methods and multiple fields) are consistent with a class that has not been properly modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
