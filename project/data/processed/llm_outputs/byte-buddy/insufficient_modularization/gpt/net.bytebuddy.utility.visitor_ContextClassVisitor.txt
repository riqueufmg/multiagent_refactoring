    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=40, NOM=5, WMC=6, LCOM=0.4. It has a single field (NOF=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
