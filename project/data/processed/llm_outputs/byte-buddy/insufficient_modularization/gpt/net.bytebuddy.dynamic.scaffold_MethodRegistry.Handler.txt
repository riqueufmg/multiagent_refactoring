    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.Handler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is relatively large (loc = 174) while exposing very few structural elements (nof = 4 fields, nom = 0 methods). This size-to-members imbalance indicates substantial implementation content that is not expressed as decomposed methods or smaller collaborating types. In addition the class is coupled to multiple external types (7 dependencies), suggesting it coordinates several responsibilities. The combination of high LOC, low method count, and multiple external dependencies supports that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and could be modularized to reduce size and implementation complexity."
