    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 283) and depends on a wide range of distinct modifier types (16 different modifier-related dependencies: ParameterManifestation, Transitivity, MethodStrictness, RequiredPhase, SynchronizationState, MethodManifestation, Ownership, Openness, Mandate, FieldManifestation, SyntheticState, TypeManifestation, FieldPersistence, ProvisioningState, Visibility, EnumerationState). As an AbstractBase it likely centralizes behavior for many modifier concerns, indicating multiple responsibilities and poor separation of concerns. These facts (size and breadth of dependencies) justify that the class has insufficient modularization and could be decomposed into smaller, more focused components."
