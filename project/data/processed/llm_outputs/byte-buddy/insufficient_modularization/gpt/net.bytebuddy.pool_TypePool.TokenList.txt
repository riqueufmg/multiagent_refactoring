    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=40, NOF=2, NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0, fanout=0. These metrics indicate the class has minimal size and implementation complexity and therefore does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization in isolation. Dependencies are limited and do not suggest internal overcrowding."
