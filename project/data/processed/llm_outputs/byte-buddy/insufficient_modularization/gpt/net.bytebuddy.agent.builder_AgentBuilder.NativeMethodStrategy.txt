    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.NativeMethodStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=76, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and WMC=0, a single field (nof=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies are listed. These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
