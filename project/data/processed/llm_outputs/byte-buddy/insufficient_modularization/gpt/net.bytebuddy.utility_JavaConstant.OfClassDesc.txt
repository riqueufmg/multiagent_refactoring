    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=17, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), and zero complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one listed dependency. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem in the provided data. Given the lack of size, complexity, or coupling indicators, there is no evidence this class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
