    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=28, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no methods to decompose (NOM=0). Given these metrics and the listed dependencies, there is no evidence this class has remaining internal complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition."
