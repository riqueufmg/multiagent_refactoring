    "justification": "High size with low decomposition: LOC = 300 while NOM = 0 and NOF = 4 indicates a large implementation block with almost no method-level decomposition. The class references multiple distinct external components (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder), suggesting multiple responsibilities and coupling to varied concerns. These factors (large LOC, few methods/fields, many external dependencies) are consistent with Insufficient Modularization and indicate the class could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
