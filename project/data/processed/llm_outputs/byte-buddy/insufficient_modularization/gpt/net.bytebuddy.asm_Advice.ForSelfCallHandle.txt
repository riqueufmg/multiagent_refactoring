    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that requires further decomposition: loc=78 (moderate size), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods and no cyclomatic complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling to other classes), lcom=-1.0 (no evidence of cohesion problems given no methods). Although several external types are listed in dependencies, the class metrics in isolation show minimal internal complexity or size that would justify splitting. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
