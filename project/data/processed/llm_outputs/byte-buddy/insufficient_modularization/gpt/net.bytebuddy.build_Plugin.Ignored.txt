    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=28, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods (NOM=0) and no complexity (WMC=0), and only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). These metrics show no evidence of a large, complex class that requires further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
