    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=23), has no methods or fields (nom=0, nof=0, nopf=0), no measured complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. These metrics indicate no substantial size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
