    "justification": "The class is very small and trivial: LOC=9, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems given the absence of members. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
