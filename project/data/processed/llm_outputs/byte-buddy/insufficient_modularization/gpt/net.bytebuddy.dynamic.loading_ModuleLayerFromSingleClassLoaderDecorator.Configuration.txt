    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and shows no sign of needing further decomposition: LOC=14, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method complexity (wmc)=0, coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). LCOM is -1 (undefined), but given the absence of methods and low size/complexity, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
