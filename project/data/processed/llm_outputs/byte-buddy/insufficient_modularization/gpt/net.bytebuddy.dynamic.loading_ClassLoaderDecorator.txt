    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class: low method count (nom = 2), very low complexity (wmc = 2), small size (loc = 70), single field (nof = 1), high cohesion (lcom = -1.0), no inheritance depth (dit = 0) and no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Dependencies are minimal (2). Taken in isolation, there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or excessive size/complexity that would justify further decomposition."
