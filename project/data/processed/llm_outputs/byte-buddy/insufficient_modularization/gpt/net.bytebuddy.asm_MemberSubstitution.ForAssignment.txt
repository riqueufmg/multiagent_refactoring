    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC is moderate (77), number of fields is small (3), number of methods is 0 (nom=0) and WMC=0 indicating no internal method complexity to decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not signal poor cohesion. Dependency list is limited and does not imply excessive responsibilities. Considering the class in isolation, there is insufficient evidence of excessive size, complexity, or responsibilities that would require further decomposition."
