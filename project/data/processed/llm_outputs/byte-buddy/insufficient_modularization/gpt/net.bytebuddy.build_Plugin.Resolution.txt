    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted method count (wmc) = 0 show no behavioral complexity to split; number of fields (nof) = 1 indicates minimal state; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show no coupling that would benefit from decomposition. Although LOC = 62, the absence of methods and low coupling/complexity provides no evidence that further modularization would reduce size or implementation complexity."
