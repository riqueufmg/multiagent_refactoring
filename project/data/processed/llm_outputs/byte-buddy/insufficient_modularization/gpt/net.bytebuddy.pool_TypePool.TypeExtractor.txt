    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.TypeExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected due to evidence of excessive size and state: LOC = 712 and NOF (number of fields) = 72 indicate a very large class with many fields (likely multiple responsibilities or large internal state). The class has multiple varied dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) which suggests it handles diverse concerns (parsing/reading, description of annotations/methods/modules, versioning and pool interaction). Taken in isolation, these metrics and dependency variety justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and could be decomposed into smaller classes to reduce size and complexity."
