    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Chain",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 4143) and an exceptionally high number of fields (nof = 197) indicate it holds many responsibilities or state. It also references many external types (24 dependencies), suggesting multiple concerns are mixed into this single class. These metrics (high nof and loc combined with many dependencies) justify that the class should likely be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
