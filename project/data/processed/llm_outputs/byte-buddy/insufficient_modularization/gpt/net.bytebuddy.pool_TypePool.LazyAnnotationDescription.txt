    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 135) combined with no declared methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0) indicates implementation is concentrated in a single, non-decomposed unit. It has multiple fields (nof = 5) and depends on several distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue, AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool), suggesting multiple responsibilities. LCOM is not informative here (lcom = -1.0), but the high LOC with zero methods and multiple external dependencies justifies that the class should be further decomposed to improve modularity."
