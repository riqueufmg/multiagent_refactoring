    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: loc=32 (small size), nom=0 and nof=0 (no methods or fields to decompose), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). With no internal members or complexity to split, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
