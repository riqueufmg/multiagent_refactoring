    "justification": "Metrics show the class is very small and simple: LOC=13, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), low complexity (WMC=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), no dependencies. LCOM=-1 (not indicating cohesion issues). There is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
