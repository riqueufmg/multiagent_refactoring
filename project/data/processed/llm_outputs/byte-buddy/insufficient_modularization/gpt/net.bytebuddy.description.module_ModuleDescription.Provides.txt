    "justification": "Based on the provided metrics, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization. The class is small (loc=17), reports no fields or methods (nof=0, nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0), has no measured complexity (wmc=0), low/neutral cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). It has a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). When analyzed in isolation, these elements indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition."
