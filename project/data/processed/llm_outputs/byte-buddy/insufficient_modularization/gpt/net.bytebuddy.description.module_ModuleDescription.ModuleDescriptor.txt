    "justification": "loc = 157 (class size is relatively large) combined with zero counts for fields/methods (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0) indicates the implementation is not decomposed into smaller members. WMC=0 and fanin/fanout=0 further suggest behavior is concentrated inside the class rather than modularized into collaborating components. Single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) while the class remains large reinforces the likelihood of insufficient modularization."
