    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=36, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. Coupling and dependencies are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Given the absence of methods and very low size/complexity metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
