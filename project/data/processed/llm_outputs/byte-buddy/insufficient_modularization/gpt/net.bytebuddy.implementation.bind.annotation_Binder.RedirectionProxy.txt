    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.RedirectionProxy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is large (loc = 209) and maintains many fields (nof = 10) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and low WMC (0), which indicates a monolithic data/behavior grouping or embedded responsibilities rather than well-separated components. It also depends on a wide range of unrelated concerns (17 distinct dependencies including ArrayAccess, Implementation, ByteCodeAppender, MethodReturn, Assigner, TypeDescription, DynamicType, MethodAccessorFactory, StackManipulation, Duplication, etc.), suggesting multiple responsibilities. Together, the high LOC, high field count, and broad dependency set justify decomposing the class into smaller, more focused classes/modules."
