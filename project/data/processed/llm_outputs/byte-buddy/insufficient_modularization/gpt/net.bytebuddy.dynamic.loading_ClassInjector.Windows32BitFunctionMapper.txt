    "justification": "Not detected: the class shows no signs of being under-modularized. Metrics indicate very small size and no implementation to decompose (loc=16, nof=0, nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0, wmc=0). Coupling indicators are absent (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is not meaningful (-1.0) but with zero fields/methods there is no decomposition opportunity."
