    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem.ForNio2CapableVm",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 97 LOC while reporting 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 weighted methods complexity (wmc=0), which indicates a relatively large implementation body with no method decomposition. It has 3 fields (nof=3) but no callable modular units, and low coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) that imply the implementation is self-contained rather than cleanly separated. These elements (high LOC with nom=0 and wmc=0) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization because further decomposition into methods/classes could reduce size and complexity."
