    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Resolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an oversized or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition: small size (LOC = 39), no methods reported (nom = 0) and low complexity (WMC = 0), only three fields (nof = 3), and no measured coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These values suggest the class is already small/simple in isolation, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
