    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=31, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0, DIT=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, only two external dependencies listed), and cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) does not indicate fragmentation. There is no sign of high complexity, many responsibilities, or large size that would justify further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
