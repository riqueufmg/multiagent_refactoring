    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that needs further decomposition: LOC is 39, NOM (number of methods) is 0, WMC is 0, NOF is 1 (single field), fan-in and fan-out are 0. LCOM is not indicative (-1.0). The class is small, has no methods/complexity to decompose, and has only a few external type dependencies, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
