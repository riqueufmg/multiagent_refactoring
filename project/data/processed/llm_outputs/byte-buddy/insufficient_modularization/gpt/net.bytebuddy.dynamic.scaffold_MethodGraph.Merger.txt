    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=39 (small), NOM=0 (no methods to decompose), NOF=1 (single field), WMC=0 (no measurable complexity), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling/dependencies), NOPF=0 and NOPM=0. Given the absence of methods and low size/complexity, there is no evidence this class requires further decomposition."
