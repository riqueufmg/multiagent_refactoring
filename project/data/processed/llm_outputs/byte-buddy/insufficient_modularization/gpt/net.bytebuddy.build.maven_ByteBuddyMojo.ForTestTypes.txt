    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.ForTestTypes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class analyzed in isolation shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=13), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no fields/packaged fields (nof=0, nopf=0, nopm=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is trivial or empty rather than a large undecomposed unit, so decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
