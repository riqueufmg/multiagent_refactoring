    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTask",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits indicators of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (LOC = 172) combined with moderate-to-high complexity (WMC = 15) and a sizable API/behavior surface (NOM = 13 methods, NOPM = 9 public methods). It also maintains state (NOF = 6 fields) while exposing many public behaviors, increasing the likelihood of multiple responsibilities within the same class. Although cohesion (LCOM = 0.2308) is not high (lower LCOM indicates some cohesion), the overall size and complexity metrics (LOC, WMC, NOM, NOPM) suggest the class could be decomposed into smaller classes or helper components (for example separating task orchestration, incremental resolution, and plugin handling) to reduce implementation complexity and class size. The listed dependencies (IncrementalResolver, InputChanges, Plugin, PathSensitivity) further indicate it interacts with multiple concerns that could be modularized."
