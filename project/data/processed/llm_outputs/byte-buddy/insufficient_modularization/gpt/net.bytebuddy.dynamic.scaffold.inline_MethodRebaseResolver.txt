    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodRebaseResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 425) while exposing very few methods (nom = 3), indicating monolithic, long methods rather than a set of smaller, focused classes. The small method count paired with high LOC suggests responsibility concentration that could be split. Although WMC is low (3), that reflects low cyclomatic complexity per method, not good decomposition. The class also interacts with multiple distinct concepts/types (e.g. MethodNameTransformer, MethodAccessorFactory, AuxiliaryType, Resolution), implying multiple responsibilities collocated in one class. These facts point to Insufficient Modularization."
