    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has low size and complexity: LOC=44, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies listed. These metrics indicate the class is small, not complex, and not highly coupled, so there is no evidence it requires further decomposition."
