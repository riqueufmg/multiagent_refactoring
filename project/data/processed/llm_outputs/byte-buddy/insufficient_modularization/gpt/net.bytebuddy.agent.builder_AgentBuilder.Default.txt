    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 2133) and has many features/elements (nof = 88), which are typical indicators of a class that can be further decomposed. It depends on a large number of distinct types (23 dependencies listed, e.g. DynamicType, TypePool, ClassLoadingStrategy, Implementation, ByteBuddy, TypeDescription, ClassFileLocator), suggesting multiple responsibilities and cross-cutting concerns. The inheritance depth is shallow (dit = 1), indicating the complexity is concentrated in this single class rather than distributed via subclassing. Taken together (high LOC, high NOF, many external dependencies, shallow DIT) these elements justify flagging Insufficient Modularization for this class."
