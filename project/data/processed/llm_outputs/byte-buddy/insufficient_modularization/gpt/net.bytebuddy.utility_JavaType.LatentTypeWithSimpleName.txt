    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType.LatentTypeWithSimpleName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=20), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency), and no inheritance depth (dit=0). LCOM is not meaningful given the absence of methods. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
