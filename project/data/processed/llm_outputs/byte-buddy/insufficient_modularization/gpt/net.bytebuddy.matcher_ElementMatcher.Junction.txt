    "justification": "Lines of code (loc=170) is large for a single class/file, while method counts are zero (nom=0, nopm=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2). The combination of high LOC with no methods indicates the class body is large but not decomposed into smaller methods/components, suggesting it can be further decomposed. WMC=0 alongside large LOC points to size-driven modularization issues rather than per-method complexity. Isolation metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=1) reinforce that this large class is self-contained and a candidate for decomposition."
