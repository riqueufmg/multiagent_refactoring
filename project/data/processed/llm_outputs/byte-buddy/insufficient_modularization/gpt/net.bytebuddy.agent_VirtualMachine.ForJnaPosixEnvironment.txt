    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.ForJnaPosixEnvironment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected due to excessive size and state: LOC = 391 (large class) and NOF = 18 (many fields) indicate multiple responsibilities packed into one class. NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 suggest methods are absent or minimal while the class still occupies substantial code, implying logic or responsibilities are not modularized into separate methods/classes. Fan-in = 0 and Fan-out = 0 (no dependencies) do not mitigate the class's internal size. These elements together justify insufficient modularization and that further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
