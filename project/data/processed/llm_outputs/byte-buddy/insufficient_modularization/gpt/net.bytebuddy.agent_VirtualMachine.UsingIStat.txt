    "justification": "The class shows no behavioral complexity or responsibilities to decompose: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted methods per class (wmc) = 0, indicating no method-level functionality to split. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and there are no package-level fields flagged as problematic (nopf = 0). Although LOC = 86 and number of fields (nof = 4) indicate some size, in isolation size alone (without methods or measurable cohesion) is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization. The cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) is not meaningful here, so it does not support a decomposition need. Therefore, based on the provided metrics, the smell is not detected."
