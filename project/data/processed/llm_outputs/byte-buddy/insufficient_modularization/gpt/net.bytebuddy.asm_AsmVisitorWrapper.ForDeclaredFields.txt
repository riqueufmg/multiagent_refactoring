    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.ForDeclaredFields",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is moderately large (loc: 136) while holding multiple fields (nof: 5) and depending on several external types (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader). These facts indicate the class likely spans multiple responsibilities and integration points, suggesting it has not been fully decomposed. The combination of non-trivial size (loc) and multiple dependencies supports detection of Insufficient Modularization."
