    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.AbstractPropertyAccessorMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small size (loc=16), no methods or fields reported (nom=0, nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex and does not show signs that it needs further decomposition."
