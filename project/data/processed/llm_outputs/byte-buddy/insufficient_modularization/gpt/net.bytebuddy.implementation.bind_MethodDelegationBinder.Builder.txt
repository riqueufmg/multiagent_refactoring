    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modularized: it has a non-trivial size (loc = 126) and a relatively large number of fields (nof = 10), indicating multiple held responsibilities or configuration points. There are multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription), which suggests the class is coordinating varied concerns. Additionally, the metrics report nom = 0 and nopf = 0 (no methods decomposed), implying behavior is not broken into smaller methods/classes within this type. Taken together (size, many fields, and cross-cutting dependencies with no internal decomposition), these characteristics justify flagging insufficient modularization and recommend decomposing responsibilities into separate helper classes or smaller components."
