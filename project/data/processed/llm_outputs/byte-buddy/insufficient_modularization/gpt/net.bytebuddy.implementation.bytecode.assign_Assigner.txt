    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No smell detected: the class is small and simple in isolation. Metrics show only 1 method (nom=1) and 3 fields (nof=3), low complexity (wmc=1), moderate size (loc=95) and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are only a few referenced types. These elements indicate the class is not insufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition based on the provided data."
