    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.CreateClassVisitorFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 202) while exposing very few fields (nof = 2) and no reported methods (nom = 0), which suggests substantial implementation inside few/large methods or non-decomposed blocks. It also depends on many external components (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.MultipleParentClassLoader, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodReturn, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.ConstructorStrategy, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy), indicating multiple responsibilities or cross-cutting concerns handled within the same class. Together, these elements (high LOC, low field/method granularity, and many dependencies) indicate Insufficient Modularization and that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
