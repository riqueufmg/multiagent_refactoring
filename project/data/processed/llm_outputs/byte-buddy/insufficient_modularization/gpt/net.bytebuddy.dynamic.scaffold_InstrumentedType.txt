    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 1502), many fields (nof = 26) and many methods (nom = 24), and a non-trivial complexity (wmc = 24). It also depends on a large set of types (21 dependencies) and references inner roles (InstrumentedType.Factory and InstrumentedType.Default), indicating multiple responsibilities bundled into a single class. These factors (high LOC, high field/method counts, notable WMC, and many dependencies/inner-role indicators) justify that the class should be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
