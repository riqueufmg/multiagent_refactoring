    "justification": "Class metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is small (40), number of methods (nom) = 0 and WMC = 0 (no implementation complexity to decompose), number of fields (nof) = 2 (small state), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no coupling/dependencies to warrant splitting). The LCOM value is invalid (-1.0) and cannot justify decomposition. Based on these elements in isolation, further decomposition is not warranted."
