    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Based on the provided metrics the class is small and low-complexity: LOC=46, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0. It has only 3 fields (NOF=3) and no methods, zero coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). LCOM is not indicating cohesion problems (-1.0). Given these values, there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition; therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
