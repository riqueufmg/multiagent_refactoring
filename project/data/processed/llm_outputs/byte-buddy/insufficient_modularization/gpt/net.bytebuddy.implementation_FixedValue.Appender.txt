    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is not flagged for Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=25), minimal state/members (nof=1, nom=0), zero measured complexity (wmc=0), shallow inheritance (dit=1), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependencies are few and focused. These metrics indicate the class is already small and simple with no evidence of multiple responsibilities or high implementation complexity that would justify further decomposition."
