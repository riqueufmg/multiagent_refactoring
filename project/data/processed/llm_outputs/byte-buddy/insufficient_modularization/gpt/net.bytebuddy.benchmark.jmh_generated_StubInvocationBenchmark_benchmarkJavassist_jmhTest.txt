    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: an extremely high number of fields (nof = 263) while having relatively few methods (nom = 9) indicates it aggregates a large amount of state. The class size (LOC = 276) and complexity (WMC = 42) are elevated, and the method-to-field ratio is very low (9 methods for 263 fields), suggesting multiple responsibilities or large grouped data that could be split. Although LCOM = 0.0 indicates methods are not showing lack of cohesion, the sheer volume of fields and the nontrivial complexity make further decomposition likely to reduce size and implementation complexity."
