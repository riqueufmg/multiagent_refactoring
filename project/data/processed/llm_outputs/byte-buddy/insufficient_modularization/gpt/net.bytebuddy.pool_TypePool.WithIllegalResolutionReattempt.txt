    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=43, number of fields=1 (nof=1), number of methods=0 (nom=0), weighted method count=0 (wmc=0). It shows no inheritance or nesting complexity (dit=0, nc=0), no coupling indications (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal in size and complexity, providing no evidence of insufficient modularization."
