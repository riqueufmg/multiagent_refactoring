    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=34, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no method complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or multiple responsibilities that would justify further decomposition; dependency list is minimal (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
