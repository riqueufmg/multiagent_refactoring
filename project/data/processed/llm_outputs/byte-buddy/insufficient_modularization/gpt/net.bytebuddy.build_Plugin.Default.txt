    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (LOC = 568) combined with many fields (NOF = 23) indicates a large, stateful implementation that likely contains multiple responsibilities. Reported low cohesion (LCOM = -1.0) suggests the members are not well-focused. The class also references a wide range of external types (11 dependencies), implying it coordinates diverse functionality. The discrepancy between large LOC and zero recorded methods (NOM = 0) further points to an atypical, monolithic implementation rather than a set of smaller cohesive modules. These elements together justify refactoring into smaller, more focused classes."
