    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods/complexity to decompose), nof=1 and nopm=0 (only a single field, no public fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling indicating responsibilities spread), and although loc=66 is moderate, without methods or measured complexity there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
