    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.ForLegacyVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and has no internal structure to decompose: loc=13, nom=0, nof=0, nopf=0, nopm=0, wmc=0. It also has no couplings or dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate minimal size and complexity, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class."
