    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, NOM=3, WMC=3, NOF=1, LCOM=0.0. Low size and low complexity (small method count and low weighted complexity) indicate the class is already simple and focused. Coupling metrics show no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few dependencies, so there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
