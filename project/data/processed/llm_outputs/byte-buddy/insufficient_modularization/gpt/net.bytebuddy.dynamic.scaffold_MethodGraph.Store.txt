    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Store",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows a very large size (loc = 617) and a high number of fields (nof = 19), which indicate a substantial, potentially multi-responsibility implementation. The reported method count (nom = 0) contrasted with the large LOC suggests a monolithic structure (long methods, nested logic, or bundled responsibilities) rather than a set of smaller cohesive components. These metrics (LOC and NOF, plus the method-count/size mismatch) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization: the class should be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
