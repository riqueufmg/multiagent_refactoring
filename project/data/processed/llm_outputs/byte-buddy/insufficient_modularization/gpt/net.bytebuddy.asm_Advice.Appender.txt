    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted method complexity (wmc) = 0 show no concentrated behavioral complexity to decompose; cohesion (lcom) = -1.0 suggests good cohesion; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show low coupling; although LOC = 84 and number of fields (nof) = 6 are non-zero, they are not accompanied by high complexity or many methods that would justify further decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence in the provided metrics that the class is insufficiently modularized."
