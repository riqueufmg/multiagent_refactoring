    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: although LOC = 147, it has nom = 0 and wmc = 0 (no methods/low complexity), lcom = -1.0 (high cohesion), and fanin = 0 / fanout = 0 (low coupling). Dependency list is small (2). These metrics indicate the class is not large/complex in terms of behavior that would benefit from further decomposition."
