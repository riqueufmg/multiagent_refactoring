    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: only 3 methods (nom=3) and 1 field (nof=1) with low complexity (wmc=3). LOC is moderate (79) but does not coincide with high method count or complexity. LCOM value (-1.0) indicates good cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no inheritance depth (dit=0). Given these metrics and the limited dependencies, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
