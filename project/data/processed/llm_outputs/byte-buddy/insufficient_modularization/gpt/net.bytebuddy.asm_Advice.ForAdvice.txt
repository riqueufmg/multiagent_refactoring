    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForAdvice",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 154) while exposing many fields (nof = 7) and no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0). The combination of high LOC and multiple fields with no method-level decomposition suggests the class bundles data/behavior and has not been further decomposed. Additional indicators: wmc = 0 and dit = 0 (no clear behavioral decomposition or inheritance structure) and listed dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize) imply the class touches multiple concerns. Together these elements justify that Insufficient Modularization is present and the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
