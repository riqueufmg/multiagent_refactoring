    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 451) combined with a high number of fields (nof = 13) while reporting no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0). This imbalance (many fields, effectively no method-level decomposition) indicates the implementation is concentrated in a single unit rather than split into smaller, cohesive components. The shallow inheritance (dit = 1) and minimal external dependencies reinforce that the size is within this class itself, supporting the need for further decomposition."
