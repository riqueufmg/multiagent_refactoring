    "justification": "The class does not show characteristics of insufficient modularization: it has only 2 fields, 0 methods (nom=0), low size (loc=45), no measured complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence of high responsibility count, large method set, or high complexity that would justify further decomposition."
