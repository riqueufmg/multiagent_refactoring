    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 70 LOC but reports 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted methods complexity (wmc=0), 0 fields (nof=0) and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). In isolation this indicates no internal behavioral complexity or multiple responsibilities to decompose (likely a simple enum/constant holder), so there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
