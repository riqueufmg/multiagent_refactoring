    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a moderate size (loc: 307), other indicators do not suggest insufficient modularization: number of methods is small (nom: 8) with low complexity (wmc: 8), very few fields (nof: 2), high cohesion (lcom: -1.0), shallow inheritance (dit: 1) and small number of children (nc: 2). Fan-in/fan-out are 0 and the listed dependencies are limited. These metrics indicate the class is cohesive and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
