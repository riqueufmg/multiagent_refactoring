    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: nom=5 (small number of methods), loc=75 (moderate size), wmc=7 (low-to-moderate complexity), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion), dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 and no dependencies. In isolation these values suggest the class is cohesive and not overly large or complex, so further decomposition is not warranted."
