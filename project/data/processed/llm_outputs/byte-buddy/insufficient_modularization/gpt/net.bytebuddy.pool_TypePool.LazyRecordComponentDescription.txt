    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: LOC=73, WMC=0, NOM=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. It has 6 fields but no methods, suggesting a simple data-holder rather than a large, undecomposed implementation. Coupling is minimal (single dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription). Given the low size, zero method complexity, and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
