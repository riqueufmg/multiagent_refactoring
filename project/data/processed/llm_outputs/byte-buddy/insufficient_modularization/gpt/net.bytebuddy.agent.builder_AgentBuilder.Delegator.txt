    "justification": "LOC = 316 indicates a large class body that likely contains substantial implementation. NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no recorded methods/complexity) combined with FANOUT = 0 and FANIN = 0 suggest the class encapsulates behavior internally rather than delegating to other classes. DIT = 1 shows minimal inheritance depth, implying the class is not decomposed via subclassing. These elements together point to Insufficient Modularization (the class is large and not decomposed)."
