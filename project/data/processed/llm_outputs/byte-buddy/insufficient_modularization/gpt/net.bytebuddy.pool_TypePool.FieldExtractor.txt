    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.FieldExtractor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, high-complexity class: LOC is modest (61), there are no methods reported (nom = 0) and cyclomatic/implementation complexity is zero (wmc = 0). Coupling is low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only a single external dependency is listed (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader). Although the class has a moderate number of fields (nof = 6), the absence of methods and low complexity suggest a simple data holder rather than a large, multifaceted class that requires further decomposition. LCOM is ambiguous (-1.0) and does not provide clear evidence of poor cohesion. Therefore there is insufficient evidence, from the provided metrics and dependencies in isolation, to flag Insufficient Modularization."
