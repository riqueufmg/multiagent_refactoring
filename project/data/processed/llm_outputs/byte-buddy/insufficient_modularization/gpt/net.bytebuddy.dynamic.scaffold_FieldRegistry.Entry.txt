    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: the class is small (loc=49) with only a few fields (nof=4) and no methods (nom=0), indicating it is likely a simple data holder. Complexity metrics are minimal (wmc=0), cohesion is indicated as high (lcom=-1.0), coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0), and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). The provided dependency set is limited. These attributes do not suggest a large or complex class that requires further decomposition."
