    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.SubclassImplementationTarget.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: it is small (LOC = 27), has no measured methods (NOM = 0) and zero complexity (WMC = 0), minimal state (NOF = 1, NOPF = 0), and very low coupling (FANIN = 0, FANOUT = 0). Dependencies are limited to two types only (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
