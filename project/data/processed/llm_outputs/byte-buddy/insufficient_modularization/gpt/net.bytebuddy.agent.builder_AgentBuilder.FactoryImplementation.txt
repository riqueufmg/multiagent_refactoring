    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.FactoryImplementation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is minimal and does not require further decomposition: LOC=41, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. With no methods and very low complexity, there is no evidence of a large, undecomposed implementation or high cohesion/complexity that would indicate Insufficient Modularization. Dependencies are limited, supporting the conclusion that the class is already small and focused."
