    "justification": "LOC = 64 but NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 indicate no internal method complexity to decompose; LCOM = -1.0 (no indication of low cohesion), DIT = 1 and FANIN/FANOUT = 0 show low coupling and shallow inheritance. Given the absence of methods (nom=0) and zero measured complexity/coupling, there is no evidence in the provided metrics that the class has insufficient modularization or that it can be further decomposed."
