    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that requires further decomposition: LOC=59 (small), NOF=4 (few fields), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no internal complexity/behavior reported), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling), only 2 external dependencies. Based on these values the class does not exhibit the size or complexity characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
