    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 205) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and zero WMC, indicating a large, monolithic implementation (likely large constructors/static blocks or inlined logic) that has not been decomposed; cohesion metric is unavailable/negative (lcom = -1.0) suggesting low or indeterminate cohesion; low external coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, only two declared dependencies) implies responsibilities are concentrated inside the class rather than delegated. These elements together justify flagging insufficient modularization."
