    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=46, NOM=5, WMC=5, NOF=1 and NOPM=4 indicate limited size and complexity. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 and a single dependency also suggest low coupling. Although LCOM=0.8 signals a potential cohesion concern, the overall low LOC, method count and complexity do not justify splitting the class further in isolation. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
