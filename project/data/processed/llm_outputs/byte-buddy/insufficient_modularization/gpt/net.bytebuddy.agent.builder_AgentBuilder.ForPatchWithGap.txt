    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=35, no methods (nom=0), WMC=0 (no measured complexity), only one field (nof=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion data is not indicating fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). Given these metrics the class does not show signs of being insufficiently modularized."
