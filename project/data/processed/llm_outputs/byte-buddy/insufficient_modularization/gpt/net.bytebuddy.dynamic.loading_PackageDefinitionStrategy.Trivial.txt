    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: nominal size (loc = 69) with no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and low structural complexity (wmc = 0). The class has only two fields (nof = 2), no coupling to or from other elements (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and no inheritance depth (dit = 0). These values show no internal complexity or responsibility concentration that would suggest further decomposition is needed."
