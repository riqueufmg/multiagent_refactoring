    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 93 LOC, the available metrics show no methods or fields (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no recorded collaborators (nc=0). There is no metric evidence of multiple responsibilities or internal complexity that would indicate an incompletely decomposed class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
