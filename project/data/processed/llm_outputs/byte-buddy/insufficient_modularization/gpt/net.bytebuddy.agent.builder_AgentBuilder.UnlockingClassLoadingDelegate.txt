    "justification": "No evidence of insufficient modularization when considering the class in isolation: very small size (loc = 28), no methods (nom = 0) and zero complexity (wmc = 0), only one field (nof = 1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and only minimal external dependencies. LCOM = -1.0 provides no cohesion concern here. These metrics indicate the class is already small/simple and does not show signs that it needs further decomposition."
