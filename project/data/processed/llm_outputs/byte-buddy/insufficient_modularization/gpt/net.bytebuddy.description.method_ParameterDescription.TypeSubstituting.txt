    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC is moderate (88), number of methods (nom) = 0 and WMC = 0 show no internal complexity to split, number of fields (nof) = 3 is small, fan-in = 0 and fan-out = 0 indicate low coupling, and listed dependencies are limited. Given the class in isolation these values do not justify further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
