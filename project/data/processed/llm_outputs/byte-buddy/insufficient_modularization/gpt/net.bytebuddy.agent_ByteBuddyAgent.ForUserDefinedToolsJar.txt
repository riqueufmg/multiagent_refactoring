    "justification": "The class shows no behavioral complexity or size that would indicate missing decomposition: nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods), nof=1 and nopf=1 (single field), wmc=0 (no method complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). Although loc=29, the lack of methods and functionality (LCOM=-1.0 reflects no method-based cohesion) indicates it is minimal in responsibility and not a candidate for further modularization."
