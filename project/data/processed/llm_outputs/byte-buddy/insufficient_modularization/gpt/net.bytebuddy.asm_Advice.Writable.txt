    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show a small, low-complexity class: LOC=40, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=2. There are no methods to further decompose (NOM=0), very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and limited dependencies. These facts provide no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or that further decomposition is warranted."
