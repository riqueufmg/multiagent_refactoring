    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.ForSetter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: very large size (loc = 393) combined with a relatively high number of fields (nof = 11) indicates substantial internal state and implementation. There are no declared methods in the provided metrics (nom = 0), suggesting implementation is concentrated and not decomposed into smaller cooperating methods or helper classes. The class also references multiple distinct concepts/types (dependencies include Implementation, MethodReturn, Assigner, FieldDescription, TypeDescription, StackManipulation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), implying it carries multiple responsibilities that could be split. Taken together (high LOC, many fields, zero methods in the metrics, and multiple external dependencies) support detecting Insufficient Modularization."
