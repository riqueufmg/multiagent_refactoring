    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: LOC=15 (small size), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods or complexity to split), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling to decompose). LCOM=-1.0 does not show cohesion problems in this context. Given the class's small size and lack of internal complexity or dependencies, Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
