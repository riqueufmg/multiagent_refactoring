    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForPrimitiveType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a moderate size (loc=137), it contains no methods (nom=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0). It holds a small number of fields (nof=5) and shows no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate a data/constant holder rather than a large, behavior-rich class that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
