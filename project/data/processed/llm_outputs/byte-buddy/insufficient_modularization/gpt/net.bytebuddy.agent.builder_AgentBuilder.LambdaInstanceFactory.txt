    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaInstanceFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 502) and a high number of fields (nof = 27) which indicate substantial state and likely multiple responsibilities. The class also depends on many external types (e.g. net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, etc.), suggesting it handles varied concerns. The combination of large LOC and many fields with numerous dependencies supports that the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split into smaller, more focused modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
