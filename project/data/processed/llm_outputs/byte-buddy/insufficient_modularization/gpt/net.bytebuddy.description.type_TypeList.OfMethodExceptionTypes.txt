    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: nominal size is moderate (loc = 75) but the class has no methods (nom = 0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc = 0). It has only 4 fields (nof = 4) and no incoming or outgoing coupling reported (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Dependency list is small and limited to three known types. These values show low implementation complexity and low coupling, so there is no evidence that this class requires further decomposition."
