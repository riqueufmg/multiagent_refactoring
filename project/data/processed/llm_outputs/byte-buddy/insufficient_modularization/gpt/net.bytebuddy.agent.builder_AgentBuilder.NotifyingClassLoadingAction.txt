    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=42, number of fields=3, number of methods=0, WMC=0. There is no evidence of high complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition (no methods to split, low coupling: fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependency list is minimal (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
