    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=23, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, NOF=1. It has no methods to decompose (NOM=0) and minimal field count (NOF=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited (2 listed). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion concerns in the provided data. These metrics show no evidence that the class needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
