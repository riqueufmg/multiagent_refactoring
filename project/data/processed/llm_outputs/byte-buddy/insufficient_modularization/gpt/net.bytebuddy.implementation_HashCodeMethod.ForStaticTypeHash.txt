    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=13, NOM=0, WMC=0, Fanin=0, Fanout=0. There are no methods to decompose and coupling is minimal (only 2 external type dependencies). Given the low size, zero measured complexity, and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
