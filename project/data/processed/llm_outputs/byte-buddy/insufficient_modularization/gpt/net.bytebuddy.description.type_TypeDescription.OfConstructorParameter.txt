    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.OfConstructorParameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of Insufficient Modularization based on the provided isolated metrics: small size (loc=41), low structural complexity (wmc=0), no methods reported (nom=0, nopm=0), only three fields (nof=3), zero coupling measured (fanin=0, fanout=0), zero inheritance depth (dit=0), and only two listed dependencies. These elements indicate the class is small, low-complexity, and not monolithic, so further decomposition is not justified from the given data."
