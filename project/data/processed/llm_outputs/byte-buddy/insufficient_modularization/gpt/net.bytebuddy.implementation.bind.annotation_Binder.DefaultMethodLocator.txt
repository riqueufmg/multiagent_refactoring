    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.DefaultMethodLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=50), no methods (nom=0) and very low complexity (wmc=0), single field (nof=1), zero incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependencies list is small. These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
