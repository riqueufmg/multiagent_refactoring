    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Sink",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC=88 (moderate size) but NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods and no measured complexity), NOF=1 (single field), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). The absence of methods and low complexity/coupling provide no evidence that the class holds multiple responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition."
