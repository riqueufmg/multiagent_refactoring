    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfDynamicInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and low-complexity (loc=51), has no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc=0), contains only a few fields (nof=3), shows no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and has limited external dependencies. These metrics provide no evidence that the class has not been decomposed or that it would benefit from further modularization."
