    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 220) while having a small declared surface (nof = 5 fields, nom = 0 methods, nopm = 0 public methods). The high LOC combined with few distinct methods/entries indicates a monolithic implementation that could be further decomposed. The class also depends on multiple external types (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities/coupling that modularization could reduce. These elements (high LOC, limited method granularity, and multiple dependencies) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
