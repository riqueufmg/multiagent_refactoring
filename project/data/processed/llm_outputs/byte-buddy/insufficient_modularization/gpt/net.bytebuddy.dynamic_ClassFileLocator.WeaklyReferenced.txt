    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.WeaklyReferenced",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no evidence of insufficient modularization: very low functional size (nom=0 methods, nof=1 field), zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LOC=62 is moderate but with no methods/complexity to decompose and LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metrics are not showing multiple unrelated responsibilities. These metrics indicate the class is small and simple rather than a candidate for further decomposition."
