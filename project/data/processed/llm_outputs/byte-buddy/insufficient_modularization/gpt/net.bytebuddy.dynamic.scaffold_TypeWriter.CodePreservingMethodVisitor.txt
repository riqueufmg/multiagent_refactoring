    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: LOC is moderate (91) but the class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and no methods reported (nom=0, wmc=0), suggesting little internal implementation to split. Cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not suggest multiple unrelated responsibilities. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and listed external dependencies are limited, providing no evidence of excessive complexity or size that would benefit from additional modularization."
