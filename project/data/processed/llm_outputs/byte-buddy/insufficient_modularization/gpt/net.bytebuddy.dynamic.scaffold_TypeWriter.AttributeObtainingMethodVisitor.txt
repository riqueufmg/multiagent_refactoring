    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=48, nof=2, nom=0, wmc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 and only one external dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader). There are no methods (nom=0) and complexity is zero (wmc=0), so there is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would require further decomposition."
