    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.MethodMatchAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: it has modest size (loc = 87), only one field (nof = 1) and no methods (nom = 0), zero measured complexity (wmc = 0), and no measured coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics indicate a single, low-complexity responsibility rather than a large, undecomposed class; therefore further decomposition is not indicated from the provided data."
