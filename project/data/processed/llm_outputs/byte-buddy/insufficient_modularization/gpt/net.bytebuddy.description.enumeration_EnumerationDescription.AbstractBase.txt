    "justification": "Metrics indicate a very small, low-complexity class: LOC=27, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. There are no methods or fields to decompose and cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) is not indicating internal complexity. DIT=2 shows inheritance but does not imply a large class. Given these values, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
