    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=9, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=1 (one field), WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=1, LCOM=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0. With zero methods, minimal lines of code, zero complexity and no incoming/outgoing coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or that it can be further decomposed to reduce size or complexity."
