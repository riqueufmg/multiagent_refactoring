    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Target",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows a non-trivial size (loc = 117) while reporting 5 fields (nof = 5) but 0 methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0). A relatively large class with no recorded methods suggests it contains multiple responsibilities or large data/logic that has not been split into smaller classes. It also depends on several external types (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement), increasing the chance that responsibilities are mixed. These metrics (loc=117, nof=5, nom=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 and 3 external dependencies) justify that the class is a candidate for decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
