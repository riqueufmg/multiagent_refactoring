    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: loc=53, nof=2 (only two fields), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods/low complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are only two external dependencies. Given the low size, zero method complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
