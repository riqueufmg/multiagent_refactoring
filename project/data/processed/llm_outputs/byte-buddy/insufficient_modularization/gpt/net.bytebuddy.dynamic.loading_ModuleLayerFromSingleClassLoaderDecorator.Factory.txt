    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=23, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0. It has no measurable methods or fields and zero fan-in/fan-out, indicating low complexity and coupling. LCOM is not indicating low cohesion in this context. With only two external dependencies listed, there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
