    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin.AdviceResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc: 153) while holding multiple fields (nof: 6) and referencing many external types (12 distinct dependencies), indicating it touches multiple responsibilities and high coupling. Cohesion metrics are not clearly positive (lcom: -1.0) and there are no recorded fine-grained method counts, suggesting substantial implementation concentrated in a single class. These indicators together point to insufficient modularization — the class is large and interacts with diverse concerns and would likely benefit from decomposition."
