    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation.Invocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: it has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), indicating no internal method complexity to decompose. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although the file has 72 LOC, the absence of methods and zero complexity implies no undecomposed implementation or high internal complexity. The cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) is not indicating a decomposition problem in this isolated view. Therefore there is no evidence here that the class requires further modular decomposition."
