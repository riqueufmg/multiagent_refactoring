    "justification": "The class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 56, number of fields = 1, number of methods = 0, WMC = 0. Coupling is low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and cohesion appears high (LCOM = -1.0). There are only a few external dependencies listed. These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
