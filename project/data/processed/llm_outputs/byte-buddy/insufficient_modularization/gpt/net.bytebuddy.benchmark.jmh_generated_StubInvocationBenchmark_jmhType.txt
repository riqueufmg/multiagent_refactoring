    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is effectively empty: loc=2, nof=0, nom=0, wmc=0, nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There is no implementation complexity or size to decompose. LCOM=-1 and the absence of fields/methods mean cohesion is not applicable. Although DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, in isolation the class contains no behavior that would benefit from further modularization."
