    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.RecordComponentPool",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class has a large size (loc = 163) while exposing very few declared operations (nom = 0) and only a small number of fields (nof = 3), which suggests concentrated implementation rather than decomposition. The class also depends on multiple distinct collaborators (net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.RecordComponentAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter), indicating multiple responsibilities. The cohesion metric is non-informative/negative (lcom = -1.0) and structural complexity metrics provide no counter-evidence (wmc = 0), so the evidence points to insufficient modularization and that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and responsibility concentration."
