    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.WithLazyResolution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 459) while holding a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 10), indicating substantial internal state and likely multiple responsibilities. It has multiple external dependencies (6 distinct dependencies) which suggests it interacts with several concerns. Method/decomposition metrics show no obvious modular breakdown in the provided data (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and cohesion is not positively indicated (lcom = -1.0), all consistent with a class that has not been sufficiently decomposed. These elements together justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
