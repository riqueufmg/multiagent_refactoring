    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: low size (loc=48), very few fields (nof=2), no methods (nom=0), no cyclomatic/complexity measure (wmc=0), and no coupling indications (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependency list is small. Taken in isolation, there is no evidence of high implementation complexity or large size that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
