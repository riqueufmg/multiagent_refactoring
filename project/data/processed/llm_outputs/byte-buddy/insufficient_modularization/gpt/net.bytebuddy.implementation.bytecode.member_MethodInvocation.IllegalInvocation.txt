    "justification": "Class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=43); no methods or complexity reported (NOM=0, WMC=0) so there is nothing to further decompose; low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency listed; cohesion metric does not indicate a need for decomposition (LCOM=-1.0). These metrics do not justify further modularization in isolation."
