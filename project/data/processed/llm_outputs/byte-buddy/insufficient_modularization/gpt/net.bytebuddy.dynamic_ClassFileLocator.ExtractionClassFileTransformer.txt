    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: low size (LOC=46), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero complexity (WMC=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric does not signal fragmentation (LCOM=-1.0). Although there are 4 fields (nof=4), this small number combined with the absence of methods and complexity suggests the class is not insufficiently modularized."
