    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 12 fields (nof=12), it contains no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and very low implementation size and complexity (loc=14, wmc=0). Coupled with zero external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single child (nc=1, dit=2), there is no evidence of a large, complex, or multi-responsibility implementation that would benefit from further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
