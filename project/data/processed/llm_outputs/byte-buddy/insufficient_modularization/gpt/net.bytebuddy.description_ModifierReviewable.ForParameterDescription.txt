    "justification": "Class metrics indicate a very small, non-complex unit: LOC=15, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, no fields or methods to decompose, LCOM irrelevant (-1.0), fanin=0, fanout=0, and no dependencies. Given the low size and zero internal complexity/behavior, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or that it can be further decomposed to reduce size or complexity."
