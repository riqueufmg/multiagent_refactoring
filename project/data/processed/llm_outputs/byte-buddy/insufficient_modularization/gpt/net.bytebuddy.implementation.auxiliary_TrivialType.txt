    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TrivialType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=33, NOM=3, WMC=3, NOF=1 and DIT=1. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.666). Given the low size and complexity metrics, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further — the metrics do not indicate a need for additional modularization."
