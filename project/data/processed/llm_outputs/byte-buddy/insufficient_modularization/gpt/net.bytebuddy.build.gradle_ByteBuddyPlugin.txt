    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 314) while exposing very few methods (nom = 1, nopm = 1) and holding many fields (nof = 16). This combination indicates a single implementation unit (likely one large method) operating on many fields rather than a decomposition into smaller methods/classes. Although WMC is low (wmc = 2) and LCOM = 0.0, the extreme imbalance between size (loc) and method count implies the implementation complexity is concentrated and not modularized. The class also contains nested types (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyPlugin.Dispatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyPlugin.ForLegacyGradle) but the primary class size and field count still point to insufficient decomposition."
