    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=13), no methods (nom=0), no public/private fields (nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only one listed dependency. These characteristics show the class is already minimal in responsibilities and does not require further decomposition."
