    "justification": "nom=0, wmc=0, loc=33, nof=3, fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[] — the class has no methods, zero measured complexity, small size (33 LOC), only 3 fields and no coupling. These metrics show no internal complexity or size that would indicate a need for further decomposition, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
