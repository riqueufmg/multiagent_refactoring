    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 421) while reporting a small number of fields (nof = 8) and no reported methods (nom = 0), indicating a concentration of code that has not been decomposed into smaller methods or helper classes. Cohesion/complexity metrics are not indicative of healthy decomposition (lcom = -1.0, wmc = 0) and the class appears isolated (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) despite depending on a few external types, suggesting internal responsibilities are bundled rather than modularized."
