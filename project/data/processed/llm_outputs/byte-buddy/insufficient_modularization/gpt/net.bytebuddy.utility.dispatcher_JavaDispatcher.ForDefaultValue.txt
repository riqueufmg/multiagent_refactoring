    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large class size (loc = 253) combined with a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 8) indicates potential multiple responsibilities; zero methods (nom = 0) and zero WMC (wmc = 0) suggest the class packs substantial implementation/structure without clear decomposition; cohesion metric unavailable (lcom = -1.0) but the size and field count alone justify further decomposition to reduce size/complexity and improve modularization. Dependencies are minimal (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), so the class appears self-contained and a candidate for splitting."
