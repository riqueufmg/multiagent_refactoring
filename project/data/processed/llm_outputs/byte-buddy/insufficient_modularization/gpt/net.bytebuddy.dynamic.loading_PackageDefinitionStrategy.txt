    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=547) combined with many fields (nof=19) but very few methods (nom=1) indicates multiple responsibilities/data packed into one unit. The dependency list includes several nested/variant types (NonSealing, Definition, Trivial, SealBaseLocator, Undefined), suggesting multiple strategy/definition variants are implemented inside the same class rather than decomposed. Low WMC (1) with high LOC further implies complexity is spread across the class/file instead of being organized into smaller, cohesive modules."
