    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate no need for further decomposition: small size (LOC=34), no measured complexity (WMC=0), no methods/fields reported (nof=0, nom=0), very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a highly cohesive indicator (LCOM=-1.0). Dependencies are limited to three classes but do not imply internal complexity. Considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or responsibilities that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
