    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Appending",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modular: it has a very large size (loc = 407) and many fields (nof = 12), which indicates substantial state and implementation contained in one class. It also depends on a broad set of unrelated concerns (Implementation, ByteCodeAppender, AnnotationValueFilter, TypeInitializer, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, OpenedClassReader), suggesting multiple responsibilities that could be separated. The combination of high LOC and many dependencies supports decomposing the class to reduce size and complexity."
