    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.RetainedMethodTypeVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=40), no methods (nom=0), only one field (nof=1), zero measured complexity (wmc=0), zero incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex and does not need further decomposition based on the provided data."
