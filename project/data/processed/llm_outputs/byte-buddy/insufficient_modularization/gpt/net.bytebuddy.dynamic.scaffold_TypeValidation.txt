    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeValidation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=36, number of methods (nom)=3, number of fields (nof)=1, LCOM=0.0. Complexity is low (WMC=3), inheritance depth is 0 (DIT=0), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given low size, low complexity, high cohesion and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
