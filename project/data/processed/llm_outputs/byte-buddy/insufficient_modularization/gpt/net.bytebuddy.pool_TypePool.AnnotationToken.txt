    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.AnnotationToken",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LOC = 109 indicates a relatively large implementation for an inner token class; NOF = 4 shows multiple fields (separate data elements) suggesting more than one responsibility. NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 combined with the high LOC indicate concentrated implementation (e.g., large initializers or inlined logic) rather than functionality decomposed into smaller methods, which increases implementation complexity. The dependency on HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin alongside AnnotationDescription implies the class mixes data representation and equality/hashcode concerns. These factors (large size, multiple fields, concentrated complexity, and mixed concerns) justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and is a candidate for further modularization."
