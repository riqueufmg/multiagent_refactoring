    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=33), zero methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and a single field (nof=1) so there is nothing to decompose further; low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no reported complexity. Dependencies are limited and do not imply multiple responsibilities. Therefore there is no evidence this class needs further decomposition."
