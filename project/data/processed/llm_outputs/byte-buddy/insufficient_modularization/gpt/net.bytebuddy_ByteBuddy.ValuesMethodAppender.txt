    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=24, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), low complexity (wmc=0), single field (nof=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (dit=1). LCOM indicates no cohesion concerns. There is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or large implementation that would benefit from further decomposition given the class-in-isolation metrics and listed dependencies."
