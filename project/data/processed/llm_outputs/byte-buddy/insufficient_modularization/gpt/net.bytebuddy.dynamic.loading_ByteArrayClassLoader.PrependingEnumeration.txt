    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=44, number of fields (nof)=2, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method count (wmc)=0. No coupling or dependencies reported (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Given the class is small with low complexity and no external interactions in the provided data, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
