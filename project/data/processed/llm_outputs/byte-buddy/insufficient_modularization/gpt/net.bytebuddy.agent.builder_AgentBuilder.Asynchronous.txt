    "justification": "High source size (loc: 141) combined with a non-trivial number of fields (nof: 8) while declaring zero methods (nom: 0, nopm: 0) indicates the class body contains substantial implementation that has not been decomposed into smaller methods or helper types. The mismatch between large LOC and zero reported methods suggests responsibilities or implementation details are embedded in initializers/inline code rather than modularized. WMC: 0 and LCOM: -1.0 provide no evidence of well-distributed complexity/cohesion, and the small dependency set (2 entries) implies functionality is implemented inside this class rather than delegated—together these elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
