    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.FieldPool",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows a large implementation size (loc = 187) while reporting no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and only a few fields (nof = 4). This mismatch (high LOC with zero recorded methods) indicates non-trivial internal content that is not decomposed into smaller, focused methods or helper classes. The presence of multiple external concerns in its dependencies (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, FieldDescription, AnnotationValueFilter, FieldAttributeAppender) suggests it handles several responsibilities. Together, these facts (high LOC, lack of methods, multiple dependency concerns) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
