    "justification": "The class is very small and contains no decomposable behavior: loc=16, nom=0, nof=0, nopf=0, nopm=0, wmc=0. Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no meaningful cohesion metrics for decomposition. Given the lack of methods, fields, and complexity, there is no evidence it suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
