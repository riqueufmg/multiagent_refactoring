    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: 39 LOC, 2 fields, 0 methods (nom=0), WMC=0 and LCOM not indicating cohesion issues. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only three external dependencies are listed. There is no evidence of large size or high implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition when the class is considered in isolation."
