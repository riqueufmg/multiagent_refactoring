    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.TargetHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class appears to be insufficiently modular: it has very large size (loc = 615) and a high number of fields (nof = 24), indicating a large, stateful implementation that likely mixes responsibilities. The metrics show no measured methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) which implies the entity is highly monolithic in the provided data. It also depends on many external types (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication), suggesting multiple responsibilities and coupling to varied concerns. Together, the large LOC, many fields, and broad dependency footprint justify flagging Insufficient Modularization and indicate that decomposition into smaller classes/components could reduce size and implementation complexity."
