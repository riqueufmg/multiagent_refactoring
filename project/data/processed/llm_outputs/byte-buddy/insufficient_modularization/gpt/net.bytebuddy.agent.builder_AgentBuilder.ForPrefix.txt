    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForPrefix",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=42, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, number of fields (nof)=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies are listed. Given the absence of methods and low size/complexity metrics, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
