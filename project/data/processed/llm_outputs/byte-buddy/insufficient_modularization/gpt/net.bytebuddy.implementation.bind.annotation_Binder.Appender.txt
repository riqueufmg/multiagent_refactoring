    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: loc=29, wmc=0, nom=0, nof=1. Coupling and impact are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=1). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no method cohesion concerns (no methods to decompose). Given its low size, zero measured complexity, single field, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
