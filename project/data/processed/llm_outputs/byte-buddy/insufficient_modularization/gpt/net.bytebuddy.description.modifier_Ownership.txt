    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LCOM = 0.8 (low cohesion) indicates the methods are not closely related. The class has a moderate number of methods (nom = 5) and moderate complexity (wmc = 5) with LOC = 46, while exposing only 1 field (nof = 1). DIT = 0 and fanin/fanout = 0 show it is not decomposed via inheritance or collaborations. Together these metrics (high LCOM with multiple methods and modest size/complexity) justify that the class likely mixes responsibilities and could be further decomposed (insufficient modularization)."
