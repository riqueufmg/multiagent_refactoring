    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForSignature",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected due to evidence of a monolithic implementation: LOC=332 (large class size) and NOF=10 (many fields) combined with NOM=0 and NOPM=0 (no methods reported) and WMC=0 (no measured method-level decomposition). Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 indicate responsibilities are concentrated inside the class rather than modularized across collaborators. These metrics together indicate the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and is a candidate for further modularization."
