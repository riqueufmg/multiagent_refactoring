    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: although LOC is 136, the class has a small number of methods (nom=4, nopm=3) and low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=4), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), and no coupling indications (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=0 and nc=0 further show no deep inheritance or complexity. These elements suggest the class is cohesive and not a candidate for further decomposition."
