    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=46, number of fields=2, number of methods=0, WMC=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. There is no evidence of high complexity, large size, or multiple responsibilities that would suggest further decomposition. Based on these values and considering the class in isolation, insufficient modularization is not detected."
