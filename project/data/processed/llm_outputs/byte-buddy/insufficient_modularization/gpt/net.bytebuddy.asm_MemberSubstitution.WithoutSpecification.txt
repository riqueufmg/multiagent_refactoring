    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.WithoutSpecification",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely candidate for Insufficient Modularization because it is large (LOC = 373) while containing a high number of fields (NOF = 16) but no methods reported (NOM = 0), which suggests a single large unit handling many responsibilities or complex initialization. It also references multiple external types (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue), indicating interaction with varied concerns. These elements together justify decomposition into smaller, focused classes or modules."
