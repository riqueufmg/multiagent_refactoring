    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.DeclaringTypeResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "False — the class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, number of methods (nom)=1, number of public methods (nopm)=1, WMC=4 (low complexity), no fields (nof=0) and high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0). These elements indicate the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization in isolation and does not warrant further decomposition."
