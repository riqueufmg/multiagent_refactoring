    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList.TypeSubstituting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being underspecified for decomposition: small size (loc=40), very low internal complexity (wmc=0), no methods reported (nom=0), a small number of fields (nof=3), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already small/cohesive and not a candidate for further modular decomposition."
