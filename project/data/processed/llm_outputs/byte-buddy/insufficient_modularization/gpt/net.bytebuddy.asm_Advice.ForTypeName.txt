    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity: loc=17, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0, nof=1. Lack of methods and low LOC indicate the class is already minimal and contains no internal complexity to decompose further. fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling that would suggest missed modular boundaries. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
