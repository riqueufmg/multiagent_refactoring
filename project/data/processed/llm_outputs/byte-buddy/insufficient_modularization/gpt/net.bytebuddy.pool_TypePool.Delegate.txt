    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=30), zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList). LCOM value is non-informative (-1.0). These elements suggest the class is already small and not a candidate for further decomposition."
