    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: modest size (LOC=74), very low complexity (WMC=0), no methods reported (nom=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2), very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate limited responsibilities and low implementation complexity, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
