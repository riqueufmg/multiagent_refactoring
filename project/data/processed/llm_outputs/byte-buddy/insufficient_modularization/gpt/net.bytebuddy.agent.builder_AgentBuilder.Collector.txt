    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size (loc = 302) combined with a relatively high number of fields (nof = 10) indicates the class holds substantial state and implementation. The absence of reported methods (nom = 0) suggests the implementation is not decomposed into smaller responsibilities or that behavior is concentrated, increasing likelihood of multiple responsibilities in one class. Low external coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only a couple of dependencies imply decomposition could be done internally without heavy external impact. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
