    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=27, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0, DIT=0, LCOM indicates no cohesion issues. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). No methods or complexity to decompose, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
