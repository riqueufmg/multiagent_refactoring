    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal structure: LOC=12, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0. Coupling and usage metrics are nil (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 indicates no meaningful cohesion data for decomposition. There is no evidence of large size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
