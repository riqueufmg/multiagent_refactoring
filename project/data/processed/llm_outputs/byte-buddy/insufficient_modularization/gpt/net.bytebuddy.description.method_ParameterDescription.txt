    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class is very large (loc=899) and contains many fields (nof=33), indicating it bundles substantial implementation. The file lists multiple nested/related types in its dependencies (ParameterDescription.Token, Parameter, ParameterAnnotationSource, InDefinedShape, InGenericShape) which suggests multiple responsibilities or embedded types that could be separated. Although method complexity is low (nom=5, wmc=5) and cohesion metric is favorable (lcom=-1.0), the high LOC and large number of fields point to insufficient decomposition; splitting nested types or responsibilities into separate classes/modules would reduce size and improve modularization."
