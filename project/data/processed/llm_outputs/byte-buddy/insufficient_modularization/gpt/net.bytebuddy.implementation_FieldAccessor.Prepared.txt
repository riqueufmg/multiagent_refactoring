    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=36, nof=2, nom=0, wmc=0. It has no measured internal complexity or cohesion issues (lcom=-1.0) and no coupling indications (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class requiring further modularization."
