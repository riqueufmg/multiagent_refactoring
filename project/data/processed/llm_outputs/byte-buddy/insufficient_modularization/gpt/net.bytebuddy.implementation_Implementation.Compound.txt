    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although LOC=138, the class shows no behavioral complexity: nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods/complex logic), only 3 fields (nof=3), zero coupling measures (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (dit=1). Dependencies are minimal. These metrics indicate the class does not present the size or implementation complexity typical of Insufficient Modularization, so the smell is not detected."
