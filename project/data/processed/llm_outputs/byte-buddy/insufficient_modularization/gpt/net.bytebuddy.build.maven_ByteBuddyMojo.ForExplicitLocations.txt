    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although LOC is 128, the class shows no behavioral complexity or size in terms of members: nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods), nof=3 (only three fields). WMC=0, fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate negligible complexity and coupling. Given it appears to be a simple data holder/struct with few fields and no methods, there is no evidence from the provided metrics that it needs further decomposition."
