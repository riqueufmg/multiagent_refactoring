    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.FrameGeneration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows low internal complexity and size: nom=0 (no methods), nof=2 (only two fields), wmc=0 (no measured cyclomatic complexity) and loc=129 is moderate but not accompanied by methods or dependencies. fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate no coupling to other elements. Given the absence of methods, low field count, zero complexity and no dependencies, there is no evidence in the provided metrics that the class has failed to be decomposed further; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
