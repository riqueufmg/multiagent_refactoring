    "justification": "Metrics show no indicators of an undecomposed large/complex class: loc=30 (small size), nom=0 and nopf=0 (no methods/fields to decompose), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling suggesting hidden responsibilities). LCOM is -1.0 (not indicative of poor cohesion here). Given these values, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
