    "justification": "High LOC (247) combined with a relatively large number of fields (nof=14) and no reported methods (nom=0, nopm=0) indicates a large, stateful class that has not been decomposed into smaller behavioral units. The class also depends on multiple collaborators (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoaderDecorator, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, PackageDefinitionStrategy, ClassLoadingStrategy, ClassInjector, ByteArrayClassLoader) suggesting multiple responsibilities/coupling. These elements (LOC=247, nof=14, nom=0, dependencies count=6) justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
