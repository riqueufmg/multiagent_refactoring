    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=34, wmc=0, nom=0, nof=1. Low LOC and zero method complexity (WMC=0, NOM=0) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies) show no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
