    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, trivial class not requiring further decomposition: LOC=25, NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no behavioral complexity or methods to split), NOF=1 (single field), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling that would motivate splitting). Dependencies are minimal. There is no evidence of large size or high complexity that would justify 'Insufficient Modularization'."
