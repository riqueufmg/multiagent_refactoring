    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=46, NOM=5 (NOPM=4) and WMC=5, indicating low implementation complexity. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, 1 dependency). Although LCOM=0.8 suggests relatively low cohesion, given the small size and low complexity in isolation, there is insufficient evidence that further decomposition would meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
