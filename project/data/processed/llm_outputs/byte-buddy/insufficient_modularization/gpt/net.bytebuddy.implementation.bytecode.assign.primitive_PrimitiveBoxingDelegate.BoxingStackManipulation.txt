    "justification": "The class is small and simple: loc=29, wmc=0, nom=0, nof=1. It shows minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (dit=1) and high cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0). These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so further decomposition is not warranted; Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
