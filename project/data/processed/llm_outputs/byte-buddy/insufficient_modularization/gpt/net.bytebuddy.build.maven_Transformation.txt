    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=40, nom=2, nof=2 and WMC=5. It has low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no nested structures (nc=0). Although LCOM=1.0 suggests limited method sharing, the very small size and low method/count/complexity do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
