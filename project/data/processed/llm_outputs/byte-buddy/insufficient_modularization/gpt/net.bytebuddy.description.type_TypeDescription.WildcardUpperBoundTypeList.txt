    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.WildcardUpperBoundTypeList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no evidence of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=34), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), no coupling impact (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList). These metrics indicate the class is simple and not a candidate for further decomposition."
