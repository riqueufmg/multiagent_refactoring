    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.FieldConstant.Cached",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=41), has a single field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0), zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0), and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and well-bounded, with no strong evidence that it needs further decomposition."
