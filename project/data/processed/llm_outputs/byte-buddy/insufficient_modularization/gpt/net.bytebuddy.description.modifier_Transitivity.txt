    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=46, NOM=5, WMC=5, 1 field. There is no inheritance (DIT=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LCOM=0.8 suggests some cohesion concerns, the overall low size and complexity (few methods and low implementation weight) mean further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or implementation complexity significantly. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
