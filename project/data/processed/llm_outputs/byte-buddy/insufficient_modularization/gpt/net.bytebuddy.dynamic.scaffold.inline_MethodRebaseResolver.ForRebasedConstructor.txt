    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC is moderate (125) rather than very large, WMC is 0 (no concentrated complexity), NOM is 0 (no many methods to decompose), there are only 4 fields, and fan-in/fan-out are 0 (low coupling). LCOM is -1.0 (no evidence of low cohesion). Given these elements in isolation, there is no clear indication that the class needs further decomposition."
