    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is small (28), WMC is 0 (no complexity), number of methods (nom) is 0 and number of fields (nof) is 1 — the class is minimal in size and behavior. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 (no coupling), and there is no evidence of low cohesion or large implementation to decompose (LCOM = -1.0 is not indicative of a decomposition need here). Therefore further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
