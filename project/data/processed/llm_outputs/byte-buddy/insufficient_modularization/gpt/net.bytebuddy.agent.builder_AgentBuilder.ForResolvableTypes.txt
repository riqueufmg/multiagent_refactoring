    "justification": "Metrics show a small, low-complexity class: LOC=30, WMC=0, number of methods=0, NOF/_NOPF/nom/NOPM=0, LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion data), fanin=0, fanout=0, and no dependencies. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or dense responsibilities that would indicate the need for further decomposition."
