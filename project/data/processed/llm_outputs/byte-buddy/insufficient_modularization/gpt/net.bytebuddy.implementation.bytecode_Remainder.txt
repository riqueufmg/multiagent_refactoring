    "justification": "Class shows small size and low complexity (loc=46, nom=3, wmc=3) with only two fields (nof=2) and two public methods (nopm=2). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). Although LCOM=0.6667 indicates moderate cohesion, the overall small LOC, low method count and low complexity do not justify further decomposition in isolation. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
