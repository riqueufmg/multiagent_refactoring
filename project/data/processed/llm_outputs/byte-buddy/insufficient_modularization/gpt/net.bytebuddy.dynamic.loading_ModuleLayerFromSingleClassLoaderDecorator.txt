    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization because it is large (loc = 407) while exposing few top-level methods (nom = 4) and a relatively high count of features/fields (nof = 17), indicating a lot of implementation packed into a single class. The dependency list shows at least 11 nested/related inner types (Configuration, SimpleModuleReference, ModuleLayer, ModuleDescriptor, Stream, Optional, SimpleModuleFinder, CreationAction, ModuleLayerController, ModuleFinder, Path), which is a strong sign the class encapsulates multiple responsibilities that could be separated. LCOM = 0.75 suggests reduced cohesion across its members, and wmc = 4 (low per-method complexity) combined with the large LOC implies complexity is concentrated in structure/organization rather than individual methods. These factors together justify decomposing the class into smaller modules/classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
