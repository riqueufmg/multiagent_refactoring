There are no methods or substantial implementation to decompose and only a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). LCOM is -1.0 (no cohesion data), but nothing indicates size or complexity that would justify further modularization. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
