    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LegacyVmDispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no evidence of insufficient modularization: it has 0 methods (nom=0) and low size (loc=46), zero complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only two external dependencies. Although it lists 5 fields, the lack of methods and low LOC/WM C indicate the class is small and not an undecomposed, monolithic implementation, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
