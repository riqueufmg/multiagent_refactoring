    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Delegator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 263) indicating substantial implementation that may contain multiple responsibilities. Although method-level metrics (nom = 0, wmc = 0) and LCOM (-1.0) are not available/meaningful here, the class depends on multiple distinct abstractions (TypeDescription, ModifierContributor, MethodDescription, DynamicType), suggesting it handles different concerns. The combination of high LOC and cross-cutting dependencies supports that the class is insufficiently modular and could benefit from further decomposition."
