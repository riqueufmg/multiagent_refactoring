    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LOC = 208 (large class size) combined with NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no recorded methods/complexity breakdown) indicates behavior is not decomposed into methods. NOF = 3 shows maintained state without modularized operations. LCOM = -1.0 (cohesion not evidenced/low) and DIT = 1 (shallow hierarchy) further suggest responsibilities are concentrated in this single class. The class also depends on multiple distinct components (StreamDrainer, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, ClassLoadingStrategy, AccessControllerPlugin), implying multiple concerns. Together these elements justify Insufficient Modularization."
