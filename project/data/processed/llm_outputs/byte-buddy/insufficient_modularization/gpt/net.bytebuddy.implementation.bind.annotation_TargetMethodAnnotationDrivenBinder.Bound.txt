    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder.Bound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=58), few fields (nof=4) and no methods reported (nom=0), zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and limited external dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already simple and not a large undecomposed unit, so further decomposition is not indicated."
