    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being too large or complex: LOC=30, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, no fields/methods reported (nopf/nopm/nof all 0). Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two listed external dependencies. Given the absence of internal methods or responsibilities to split, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
