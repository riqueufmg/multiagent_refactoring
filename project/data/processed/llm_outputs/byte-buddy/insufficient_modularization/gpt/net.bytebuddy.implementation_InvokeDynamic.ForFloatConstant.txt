    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=28, WMC=0, NOF=1, NOM=0. It has no methods and only one field, minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few external type references. These metrics indicate the class is already simple and does not show signs of being insufficiently modularized."
