    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Compound",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively large size (loc=149) while exposing no methods (nom=0) and only a few fields (nof=4, nopf=0). A high LOC combined with zero methods indicates significant implementation written without decomposition into smaller methods or helper classes. WMC=0 with substantial LOC and an anomalous LCOM value (LCOM=-1.0) further suggest the class's behavior is not modularized. Additionally, it depends on multiple external components (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator), implying multiple responsibilities that could be split. Based on these elements, further decomposition is recommended."
