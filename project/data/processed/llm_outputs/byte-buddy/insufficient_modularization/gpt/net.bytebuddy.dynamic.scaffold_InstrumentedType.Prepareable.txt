    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType.Prepareable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc = 24), no fields (nof = 0), no methods (nom = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and no external dependencies. LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem given the absence of members. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
