    "justification": "Metrics show the class is small and not complex: LOC=34, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems. There is no evidence of many methods, high complexity, or high coupling that would justify further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
