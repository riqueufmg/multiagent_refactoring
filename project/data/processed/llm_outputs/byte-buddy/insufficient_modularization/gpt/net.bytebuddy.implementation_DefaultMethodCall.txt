    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.DefaultMethodCall",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc=148) combined with nontrivial complexity (wmc=12, nom=9) and a lack of strong cohesion (lcom=0.5555555555555556). It has multiple fields (nof=4) and depends on many distinct concerns (Implementation, ByteCodeAppender, InstrumentedType, TypeList, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, StackManipulation), indicating it is handling multiple responsibilities (method selection/description and bytecode assembly). These metrics (LOC>100, WMC>10, LCOM>0.5, multiple dependencies and methods) justify that the class could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
