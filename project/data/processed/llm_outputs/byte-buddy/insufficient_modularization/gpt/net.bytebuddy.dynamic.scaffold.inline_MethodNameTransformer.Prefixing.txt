    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and shows no sign of undue complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition. Metrics: LOC=32, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=2, NOPM=0, DIT=1, LCOM=-1.0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. There are no methods (NOM=0) and very low complexity/interaction, so Insufficient Modularization is not indicated in isolation."
