    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: the class is trivial and does not show signs of overgrowth. Metrics: LOC=15, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. Small size, zero methods/fields, zero complexity and no coupling indicate no need for further decomposition."
