    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RepeatedAnnotationPlugin.RepeatedAnnotationAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=26, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1. It has very low coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and only two external dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. These metrics show low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
