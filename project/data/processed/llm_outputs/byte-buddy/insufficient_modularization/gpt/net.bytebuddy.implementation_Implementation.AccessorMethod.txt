    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC is moderate (80) with only 3 fields (nof=3) and no methods recorded (nom=0), resulting in zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, showing low coupling, and there is no evidence of high implementation complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition. The listed external type dependencies do not, by themselves, imply that the class is too large or complex. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
