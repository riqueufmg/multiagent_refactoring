    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: LOC = 136 (relatively large for a single class), WMC = 14 (high implementation complexity concentrated in this class), LCOM = 1.0 (poor cohesion suggesting multiple responsibilities), nom = 5 and nopm = 4 (several methods with a small set of fields nof = 3, indicating methods are not tightly focused on a single cohesive state). These combined metrics (size, complexity, and low cohesion) justify that the class likely could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
