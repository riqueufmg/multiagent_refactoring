    "justification": "Class shows no sign of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=35), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and limited external dependencies. These elements indicate the class is not too large or complex and does not require further decomposition."
