    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForFieldHandle",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modular: it has a large size (loc = 304) and a high number of fields (nof = 12), which indicates substantial state and responsibilities concentrated in one class. It depends on a broad set of 14 external types (net.bytebuddy.description.*, net.bytebuddy.implementation.*, net.bytebuddy.utility.*, etc.), suggesting it handles multiple concerns (type/field/method description, bytecode manipulation, annotations, utilities). The combination of large LOC, many fields, and broad dependency surface supports that further decomposition into smaller, more focused classes would reduce size and complexity."
