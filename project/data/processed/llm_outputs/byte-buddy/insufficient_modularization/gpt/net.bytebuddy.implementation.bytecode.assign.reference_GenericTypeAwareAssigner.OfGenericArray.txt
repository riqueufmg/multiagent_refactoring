    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner.OfGenericArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular. Metrics indicate very small size and no internal complexity: loc=36, nom=0, nopf=0, wmc=0, lcom=-1.0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one external dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). In isolation, the class has no methods or fields to decompose further, so there is no evidence that additional modularization would reduce size or complexity."
