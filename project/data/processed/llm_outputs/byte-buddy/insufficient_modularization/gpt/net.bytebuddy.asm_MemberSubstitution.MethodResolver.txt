    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.MethodResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc = 82) combined with multiple fields (nof = 4) while exposing no reported methods (nom = 0) suggests it bundles state and responsibilities rather than cleanly separated behavior. It also depends on several distinct concerns (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher), indicating it touches multiple domains and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
