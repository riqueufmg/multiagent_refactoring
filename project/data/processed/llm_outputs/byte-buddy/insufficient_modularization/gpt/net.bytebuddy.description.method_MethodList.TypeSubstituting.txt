    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=40, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=3. Low coupling and usage: fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies limited to 2 types. No internal method complexity or size indicators suggest further decomposition is needed. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
