    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList.ForTypes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=46), very few fields (nof=2) and methods (nom=0), zero measured complexity (WMC=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition in isolation."
