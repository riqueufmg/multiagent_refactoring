    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForErrorHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=40), no methods (nom=0) and only one field (nof=1) so there is no internal implementation to decompose; low complexity (wmc=0); no coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0); single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
