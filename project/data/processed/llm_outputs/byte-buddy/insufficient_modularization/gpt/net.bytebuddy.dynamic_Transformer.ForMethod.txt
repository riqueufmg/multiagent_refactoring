    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.ForMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization when considered in isolation: large size (loc = 268) indicating many lines of implementation; multiple state elements (nof = 8) suggesting several responsibilities; dependency set includes many distinct concerns (ParameterDescription, ParameterList, TypeList, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, TypeDefinition, ModifierContributor, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) implying mixed responsibilities; DIT = 1 (non-trivial inheritance level). These elements together indicate the class is sizable and handling multiple concerns and could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
