    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForDelegation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected due to excessive size and wide responsibility surface in isolation: very large source size (loc = 3230) and a very high count of elements (nof = 163) indicate the class implements many behaviors and is a maintenance hotspot. The dependency list shows the class interacts with many distinct concerns (examples: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph), which suggests it mixes responsibilities such as method/field handling, bytecode generation and manipulation, constant and annotation processing. These indicators (high LOC, high NOF, and varied dependencies) justify that the class has Insufficient Modularization and would likely benefit from further decomposition."
