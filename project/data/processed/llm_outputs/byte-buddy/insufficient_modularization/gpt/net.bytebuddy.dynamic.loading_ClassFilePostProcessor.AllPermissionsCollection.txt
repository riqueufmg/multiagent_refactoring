    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassFilePostProcessor.AllPermissionsCollection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (loc=18), only one field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0) and no method complexity (wmc=0). It has no children (dit=0), no coupling measured (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no reported cohesion issues (lcom=-1.0 indicates not applicable). The single dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) does not indicate a large or multifunctional implementation. These elements indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
