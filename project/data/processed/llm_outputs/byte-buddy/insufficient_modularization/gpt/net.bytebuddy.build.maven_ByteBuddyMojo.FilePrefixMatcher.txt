    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=27, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has a limited set of external dependencies. There is no evidence of large size, high implementation complexity, or high coupling that would indicate it should be further decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
