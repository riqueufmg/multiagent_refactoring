    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 252) combined with a relatively high number of fields (nof = 14) indicates substantial code/data concentrated in a single class. At the same time there are no recorded methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0), suggesting functionality is not decomposed into smaller methods or cooperating classes. Its isolation (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) means this internal complexity is not distributed elsewhere. These elements justify recommending further decomposition."
