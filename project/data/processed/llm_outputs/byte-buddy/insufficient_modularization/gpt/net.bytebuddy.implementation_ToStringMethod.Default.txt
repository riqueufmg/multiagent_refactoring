    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and contains no decomposable implementation: LOC = 37, number of methods (nom) = 0, weighted method count (wmc) = 0, lack of incoming/outgoing couplings (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). With no methods or internal complexity to split further, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
