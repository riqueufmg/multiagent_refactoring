    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.RelocationHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows evidence of concentrated implementation that is a candidate for further decomposition: very large size (loc = 446) and a high number of fields (nof = 17) while reported methods are zero (nom = 0) in the provided metrics. It also depends on multiple external types (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription), indicating multiple responsibilities. The combination of high LOC and many fields with no method breakdown and isolated coupling metrics (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) supports the conclusion of Insufficient Modularization — the class should be split to reduce size and complexity."
