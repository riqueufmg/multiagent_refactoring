    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, NOM=3 (NOPM=2), WMC=3, LCOM=0.0. It has no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics show low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition (no insufficient modularization)."
