    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForFolder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 132 LOC but reports 0 methods (nom = 0) and only 2 fields (nof = 2), indicating substantial code volume without decomposition into methods. WMC = 0 while LOC is high suggests large, monolithic implementation or long initialization blocks rather than smaller cohesive methods. It also depends on multiple components (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator), implying multiple responsibilities that could be separated. These elements (high LOC with zero methods and multiple dependencies) justify identifying Insufficient Modularization."
