    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, high-complexity class. Although LOC is 91, the class reports 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), 0 weighted method complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Depth of inheritance is minimal (dit=1) and only one external dependency is listed. LCOM is unavailable (-1.0), so cohesion cannot be used as evidence. Given the lack of methods, fields, complexity, and coupling, there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization."
