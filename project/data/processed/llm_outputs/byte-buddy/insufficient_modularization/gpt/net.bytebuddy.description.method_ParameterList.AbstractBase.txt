    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC is small (55), WMC is 0 (no measured complexity), NOM/NOPF/NOF are 0 (no many methods/fields to split), fanin and fanout are 0 (low coupling), LCOM is -1.0 (indicative of cohesion rather than fragmentation), and DIT is only 2. Given the small size, low complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
