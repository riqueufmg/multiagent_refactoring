    "justification": "No evidence of Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=34), very low complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0), only two fields (nof=2), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition."
