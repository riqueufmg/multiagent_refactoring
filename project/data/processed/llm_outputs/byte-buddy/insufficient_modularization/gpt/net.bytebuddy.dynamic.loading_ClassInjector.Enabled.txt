    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=28, 1 field (nof=1) and 0 methods (nom=0), WMC=0 indicating no cyclomatic complexity, DIT=0, and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is not indicating cohesion problems. With a single trivial dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) there is no evidence the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
