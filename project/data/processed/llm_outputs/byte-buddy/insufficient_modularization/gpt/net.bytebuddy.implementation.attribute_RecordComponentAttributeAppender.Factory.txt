    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.RecordComponentAttributeAppender.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=52, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods and minimal state, and dependencies are limited to RecordComponentAttributeAppender and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence the class has not been decomposed or would benefit from further modularization."
