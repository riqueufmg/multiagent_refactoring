    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_jmhType_B3",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High number of fields (nof=256) combined with zero methods (nom=0) indicates the class aggregates a large amount of data/responsibility without decomposition. Low WMC (wmc=0) and very small LOC (loc=18) together with deep inheritance (dit=3) suggest the class is a large data holder/monolith that would benefit from being split into smaller, more focused classes. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, so the class is isolated and its large field set represents internal complexity that modularization could reduce."
