    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and non-complex: loc=76, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), nof=2 (only two fields). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no methods to decompose. Although the dependency list shows referenced types, in isolation the class has no internal implementation complexity or size that suggests it has not been decomposed; therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
