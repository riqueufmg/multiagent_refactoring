    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is trivial: LOC=30, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=0, WMC=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. LCOM and DIT do not suggest internal complexity. Given the very small size and lack of methods/fields or internal dependencies, there is no indication that the class suffers from insufficient modularization or would benefit from further decomposition."
