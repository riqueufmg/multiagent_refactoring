    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForStubValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no fields (nof=0) and no methods (nom=0), very small size (loc=30) and zero complexity (wmc=0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating no coupling to or from other classes in the provided data. With no internal responsibilities to decompose and no measurable complexity or cohesion problems, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
