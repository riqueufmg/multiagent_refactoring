    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.TrivialClassCreationBenchmark_jmhType_B1",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has an unusually large number of fields (nof = 256) while having no methods (nom = 0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc = 0). This indicates a large monolithic data container rather than a decomposed set of smaller, cohesive classes. The combination of very high field count with no behavior to organize or encapsulate that data supports the conclusion that the class is insufficiently modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
