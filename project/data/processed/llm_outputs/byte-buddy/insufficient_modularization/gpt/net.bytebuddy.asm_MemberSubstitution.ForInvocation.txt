    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 134) and a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 6) while reporting no methods (nom = 0), which suggests logic is not decomposed into smaller methods or collaborators. It also references multiple external types (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation), indicating several responsibilities or collaborators. These factors (high LOC, multiple fields, many dependencies, and lack of reported methods) justify that further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
