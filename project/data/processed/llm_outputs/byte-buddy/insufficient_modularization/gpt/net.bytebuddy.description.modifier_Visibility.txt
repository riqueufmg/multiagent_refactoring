    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=87), low field count (NOF=1), moderate number of methods (NOM=9) and moderate complexity (WMC=13), acceptable cohesion (LCOM=0.444), no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Only one dependency (ModifierContributor). These values suggest the class is not large or overly complex and does not require further decomposition."
