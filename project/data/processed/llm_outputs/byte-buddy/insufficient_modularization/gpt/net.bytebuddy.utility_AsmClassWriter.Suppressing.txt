    "justification": "Metrics show the class is small and simple: LOC=40, 1 field, 0 methods, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. There is minimal coupling (single dependency) and no internal complexity or size indicating further decomposition is needed. These elements do not support Insufficient Modularization."
