    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and not complex: LOC=11, WMC=0, NOM=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, only one listed dependency). Cohesion metric does not indicate fragmentation (LCOM=-1.0, likely N/A). Given the low size, zero complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or needs further decomposition."
