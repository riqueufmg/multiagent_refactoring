    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=50, number of fields=4 (nof=4) and number of methods=0 (nom=0), weighted methods complexity wmc=0, lack of cohesion lcom=-1.0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) despite a list of referenced types; there is no internal complexity or many behaviors to decompose. Given the low size, zero measured method complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
