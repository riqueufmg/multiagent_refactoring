    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy.RecordConstructorStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=76), only one field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0), zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0), very high cohesion (lcom=-1.0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance depth (dit=1). These metrics indicate the class is small, simple and already cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
