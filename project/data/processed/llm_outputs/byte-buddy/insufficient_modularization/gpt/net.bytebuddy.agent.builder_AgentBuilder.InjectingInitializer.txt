    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.InjectingInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC is small (55), weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) and number of methods is 0 (nom=0) indicating no large or complex method bodies to decompose; it has a small number of fields (nof=5) but no methods to split into further responsibilities. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). The cohesion metric provided (lcom=-1.0) does not indicate low cohesion that would motivate decomposition. Dependencies are limited and do not imply multiple unrelated responsibilities. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
