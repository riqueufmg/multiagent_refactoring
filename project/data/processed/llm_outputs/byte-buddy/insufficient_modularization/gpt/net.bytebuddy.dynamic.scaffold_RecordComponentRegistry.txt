    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected: class shows signs of insufficient modularization. Evidence: large size (loc=208) combined with very few methods (nom=2) indicates much implementation is concentrated in a small number of routines rather than decomposed into multiple focused classes or smaller methods. The class also holds multiple fields (nof=9) which suggests several responsibilities or state elements that could be grouped or encapsulated separately. Although WMC is low (wmc=2) and LCOM is negative (lcom=-1.0), which implies individual methods are simple and cohesion is not obviously poor, the disparity between LOC and number of methods/operations is the primary indicator that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity. Dependencies including an inner/related type (RecordComponentRegistry.Compiled) further suggest embedded responsibilities that may be split out."
