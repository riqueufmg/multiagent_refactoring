    "justification": "Metrics show no signs of insufficient modularization: very low structural complexity (wmc=0), no methods reported (nom=0, nopm=0), a single field (nof=1), low-to-moderate size (loc=50) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependencies are limited. There is no evidence in the provided metrics that the class is large, complex, or carrying multiple responsibilities that would require further decomposition."
