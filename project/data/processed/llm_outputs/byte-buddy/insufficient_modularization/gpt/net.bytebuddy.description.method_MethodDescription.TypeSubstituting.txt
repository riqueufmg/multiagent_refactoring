    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: LOC is moderate (113) but the class reports 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), implying little internal behavioral complexity to split. Cyclomatic/complexity is zero (wmc=0) and there is no coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is -1.0 (likely unavailable/undefined) so cohesion cannot be shown as low. Dependencies are limited and do not suggest multiple unrelated responsibilities. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
