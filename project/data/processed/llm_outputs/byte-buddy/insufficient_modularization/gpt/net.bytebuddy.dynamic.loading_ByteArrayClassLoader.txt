    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class appears to be insufficiently modularized: it is very large (loc = 1127) with many fields (nof = 32) and many methods (nom = 21, nopm = 11) and a nontrivial cyclomatic/complexity load (wmc = 30). The dependency list exposes multiple distinct nested/inner types and responsibilities (Initializable, PersistenceHandler, CreationAction, SynchronizationStrategy, ForLegacyVm, PackageLookupStrategy, Dispatcher, EmptyEnumeration, ClassFilePostProcessor, etc.), indicating the class aggregates multiple roles. Although LCOM = 0.238 suggests some cohesion, the combination of large size, high field count, multiple public methods and numerous embedded responsibilities supports refactoring into smaller, focused classes or collaborators to reduce size and implementation complexity."
