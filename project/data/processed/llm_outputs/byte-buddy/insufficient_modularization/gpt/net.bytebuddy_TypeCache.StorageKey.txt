    "class": "net.bytebuddy.TypeCache.StorageKey",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and contains no internal complexity or responsibilities that warrant further decomposition: LOC=37, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1, fan-in=0, fan-out=0, LCOM=-1.0. With no methods and negligible complexity/coupling, there is no evidence of an incompletely decomposed class in isolation."
