    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undivided, complex class: LOC = 108 (moderate), but NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 indicate no methods/complexity to decompose; NOF = 2 (few fields); LCOM = -1.0 (no cohesion data suggesting multiple responsibilities); FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling that would imply hidden responsibilities). Given the absence of methods and low structural complexity, there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
