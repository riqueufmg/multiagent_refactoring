    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForAllArguments",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is relatively large (loc = 169) and contains a high number of fields (nof = 16), which suggests multiple responsibilities or state groups that could be split. It depends on a wide range of distinct concerns (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.NullConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation), indicating coupling to several subsystems (method/parameter description, type handling, bytecode manipulation, assignment, constants, annotations). Taken in isolation, the combination of size and diverse dependencies is consistent with a class that has not been fully decomposed and would likely benefit from further modularization."
