    "justification": "The class is small and has low complexity: LOC=41, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=3. It has no methods (NOM=0) and no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no indication of a large, mixed responsibility or high implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
