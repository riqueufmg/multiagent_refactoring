    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=28, number of fields=1, number of methods=0 (nom=0), WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There is no evidence of multiple responsibilities, high complexity, or low cohesion that would indicate it should be further decomposed. The sole dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) does not imply additional internal responsibilities. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
