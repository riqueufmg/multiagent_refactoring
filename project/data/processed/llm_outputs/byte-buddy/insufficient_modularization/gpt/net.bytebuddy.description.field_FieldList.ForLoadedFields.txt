    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=35, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0, DIT=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription) is present. Cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 does not suggest fragmentation. Given the low size, low complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
