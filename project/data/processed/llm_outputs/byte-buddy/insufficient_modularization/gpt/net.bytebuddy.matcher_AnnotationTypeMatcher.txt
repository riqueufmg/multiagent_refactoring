    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: loc=26, nom=3, wmc=3 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size and low complexity with high cohesion. It has a single field (nof=1) and few public methods (nopm=2), with no incoming or outgoing coupling measured (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two dependencies. These metrics do not suggest an undecomposed, overly large, or complex class that would benefit from further modularization."
