    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=45, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method complexity (wmc)=0, single field (nof=1). Low coupling and usage: fanin=0, fanout=0 and only 3 declared dependencies. These metrics indicate no evidence of a large, monolithic implementation that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
