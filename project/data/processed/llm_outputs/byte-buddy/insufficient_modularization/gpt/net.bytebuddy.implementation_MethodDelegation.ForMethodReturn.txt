    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC is modest (61), WMC is 0 and NOM is 0 indicating no method-level complexity or many responsibilities to decompose, and it has only 4 fields (NOF=4). Cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) and zero fan-in/fan-out suggest no tangled coupling or high interdependence. Although there are several external dependencies listed, the internal size and complexity metrics do not justify further decomposition."
