    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Annotatable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: although LOC = 107, the class shows no internal members or complexity to suggest it is a monolithic implementation (number of methods nom = 0, number of package fields nopf = 0, number of fields nof = 0, weighted method count wmc = 0). Coupling and usage indicators are minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and LCOM is not indicating cohesion problems (lcom = -1.0). With a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList) and no measurable internal behavior, there is no evidence in the provided metrics that the class needs further decomposition."
