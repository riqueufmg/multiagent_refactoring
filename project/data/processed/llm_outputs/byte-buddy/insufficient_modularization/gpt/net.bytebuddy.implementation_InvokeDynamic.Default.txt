    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a non-trivial size (loc=127) while declaring 7 fields (nof=7) but 0 methods (nom=0), indicating behavior/data are not decomposed into smaller, encapsulated units. LCOM=-1.0 (cohesion not favorable/undefined) and several external dependencies (5 listed) suggest the class mixes responsibilities. These elements together indicate the class is insufficiently modularized and could benefit from decomposition into smaller classes or methods."
