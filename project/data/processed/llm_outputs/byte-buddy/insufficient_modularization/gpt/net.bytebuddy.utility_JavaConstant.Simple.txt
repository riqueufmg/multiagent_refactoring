    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.Simple",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 575) while declaring no methods (nom = 0) and minimal measured complexity (wmc = 0), yet it holds multiple fields (nof = 9). The combination of high lines of code with no method decomposition indicates a monolithic implementation (likely large initializers or bundled logic) that could be split into smaller classes or methods. The inheritance depth (dit = 2) adds responsibility without decomposition. These metrics together justify Insufficient Modularization."
