    "justification": "The class shows a large size (loc = 309) which indicates a concentrated amount of implementation that could be decomposed. Although method-level metrics are zero (nom = 0, wmc = 0, nopm = 0) — suggesting missing/unused metric data — the high LOC combined with a shallow inheritance depth (dit = 1) and zero fanin/fanout (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) point to an isolated, monolithic implementation. These elements justify identifying Insufficient Modularization: the class is large and likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be split to reduce size and complexity."
