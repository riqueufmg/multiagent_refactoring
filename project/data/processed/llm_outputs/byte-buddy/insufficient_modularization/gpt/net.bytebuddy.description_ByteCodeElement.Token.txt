    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=63, nof=1, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0). There are only 2 external dependencies. With no methods and a single field, there is no evidence the class requires further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
