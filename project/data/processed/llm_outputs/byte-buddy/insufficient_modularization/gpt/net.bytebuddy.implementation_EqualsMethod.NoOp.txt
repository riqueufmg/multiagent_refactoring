    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=25, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods), NOPM=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 and only 2 external dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 indicates no measurable cohesion issues in the provided data. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or high coupling that would indicate a need for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
