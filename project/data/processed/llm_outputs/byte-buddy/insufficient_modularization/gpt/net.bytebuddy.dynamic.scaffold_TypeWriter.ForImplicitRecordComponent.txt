    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=50), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), single field (nof=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 provides no evidence of poor cohesion. The dependency list (4 types) alone does not imply the class is large or insufficiently decomposed."
