    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is very small (loc=11), declares no methods (nom=0), has zero complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), and shows no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) and the absence of methods indicate there is no internal implementation to decompose further. The listed dependencies alone do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
