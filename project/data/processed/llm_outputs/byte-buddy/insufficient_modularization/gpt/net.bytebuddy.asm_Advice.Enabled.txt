    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Enabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=22), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal state (nof=1), zero complexity (wmc=0), zero inheritance depth (dit=0) and negligible coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is trivial and does not require further decomposition."
