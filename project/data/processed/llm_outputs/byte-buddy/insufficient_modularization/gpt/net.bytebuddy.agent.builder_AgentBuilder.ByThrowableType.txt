    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=41, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. With only one field, no methods, low complexity and no coupling shown in the provided dependencies, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or that it should be further decomposed."
