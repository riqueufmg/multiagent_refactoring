    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: modest size (loc=63), no reported methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0) indicate limited internal responsibility; field count is small (nof=5) and coupling metrics show no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence of high complexity, large method count, or high coupling that would justify further decomposition."
