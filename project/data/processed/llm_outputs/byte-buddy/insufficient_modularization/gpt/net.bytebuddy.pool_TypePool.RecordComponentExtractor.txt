    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a monolithic or complex class that needs further decomposition: LOC=55 (small), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods/complexity), NOF=5 (few fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), dependency count=1. LCOM=-1.0 is non-indicative here. Given the lack of methods and low size/complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
