    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForLocalValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has non-trivial size (loc=78) and multiple fields (nof=5) while reporting no methods (nom=0), suggesting a concentration of state and responsibility. It depends on a broad set of distinct concerns (ParameterDescription, MethodDescription, Assigner, TypeDescription, AnnotationDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), which indicates it likely handles multiple responsibilities. The cohesion metric is not clearly positive (lcom=-1.0), further supporting low/uncertain cohesion. Together these elements point to Insufficient Modularization: the class can be split to reduce size and separate responsibilities."
