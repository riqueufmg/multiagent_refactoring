    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: loc=50 (small size), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods/complexity to split), nof=2 (few fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), dependencies limited to a single type (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). LCOM=-1.0 does not signal poor cohesion in the provided data. Given the class in isolation, there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would justify marking it as Insufficient Modularization."
