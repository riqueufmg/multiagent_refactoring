    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=25, NOM=0, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no declared methods or measurable complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. Dependency list is minimal (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter) and does not imply internal size or responsibility growth. Based on these elements taken in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
