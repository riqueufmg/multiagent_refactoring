    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and not complex (loc=71, nof=2, nom=0, wmc=0), has no methods to decompose (nom=0), and shows low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class does not exhibit size or implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. Although several external types are listed in dependencies, the class-level metrics show no internal complexity or responsibility concentration that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
