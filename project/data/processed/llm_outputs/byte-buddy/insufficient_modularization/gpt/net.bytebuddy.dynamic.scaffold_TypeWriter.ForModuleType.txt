    "justification": "Metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization. Although LOC = 99 indicates moderate size, there is no evidence of internal decomposition problems: NOM = 0, WMC = 0, NOF = 0, NOPM = 0, FANIN = 0, FANOUT = 0. LCOM = -1.0 is invalid/uncomputed. With no methods, fields, complexity, or coupling reported, there is insufficient evidence to conclude the class has not been properly decomposed."
