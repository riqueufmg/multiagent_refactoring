    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc=641) with many fields (nof=17) and a non-trivial number of methods (nom=12, nopm=10), indicating substantial implementation within a single class. It declares/depends on multiple distinct inner/strategy types (ForSuperMethodCall, ForDynamicTypeHash, ForStaticTypeHash, NoOp, NullValueGuard, ValueTransformer, OffsetProvider), which suggests multiple responsibilities bundled into one type. The cyclomatic weight (wmc=14) combined with these many members and collaborators increases implementation complexity. The cohesion metric (lcom=0.4167) is moderate (not high cohesion), supporting that the class mixes concerns. Taken together, these metrics and the presence of many embedded strategy-like classes indicate the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
