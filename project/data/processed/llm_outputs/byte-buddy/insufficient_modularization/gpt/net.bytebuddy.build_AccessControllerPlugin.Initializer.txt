    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed, overly large or complex class: number of methods (nom)=0 and weighted method count (wmc)=0 show no internal method complexity, number of fields (nof)=3 is small, fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling pressure, DIT=1 and only 3 dependencies. Although LOC=103 is moderate, it is not accompanied by method/complexity indicators that would justify further decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
