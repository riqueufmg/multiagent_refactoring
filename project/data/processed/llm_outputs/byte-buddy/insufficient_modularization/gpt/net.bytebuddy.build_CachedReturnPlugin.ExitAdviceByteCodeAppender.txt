    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin.ExitAdviceByteCodeAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no indicators of an undecomposed, overly complex implementation: LOC is modest (62), Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) = 0 and Number of Methods (nom) = 0 indicate no large method body complexity to decompose, and Number of Fields (nof) = 5 is small. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), inheritance depth is shallow (dit = 1), and LCOM is non-indicative. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
