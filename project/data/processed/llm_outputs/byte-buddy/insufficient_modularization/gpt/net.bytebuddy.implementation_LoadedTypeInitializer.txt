    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 166 LOC and 6 fields, its behavioral and complexity indicators do not suggest insufficient modularization: only 2 methods (nom=2) with low weighted methods complexity (wmc=2) indicate limited responsibilities; LCOM=-1.0 shows high cohesion; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate low coupling; DIT=0 and a small number of dependencies further support that the class is focused. These metrics collectively argue against further decomposition."
