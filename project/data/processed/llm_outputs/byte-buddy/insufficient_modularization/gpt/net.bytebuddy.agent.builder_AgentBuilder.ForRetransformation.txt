    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and non-complex: LOC=29, WMC=0, NOC/NOM/NOPM all 0, LCOM=-1.0 and fanin/fanout=0. There are no methods or complexity to decompose and no coupling to other modules (only dependency to net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
