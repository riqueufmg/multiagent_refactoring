    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=15, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0. It has shallow inheritance (DIT=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies listed. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
