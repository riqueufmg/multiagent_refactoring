    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyAnnotationValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modularized: it has a large size (loc = 305) and a high number of fields (nof = 12), indicating substantial internal state and implementation. It references multiple distinct external concepts (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.enumeration.EnumerationDescription, plus build plugins), suggesting mixed responsibilities. The cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) also indicates poor/uncertain cohesion. These elements together justify decomposing the class to reduce size and complexity."
