    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and not complex: LOC=11, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0 and NC=0. Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0). There are no methods or fields to decompose and no evidence of high implementation complexity or size that would justify further modularization. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
