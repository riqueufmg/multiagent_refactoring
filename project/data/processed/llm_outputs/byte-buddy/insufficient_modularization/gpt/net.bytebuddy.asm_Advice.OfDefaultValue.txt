    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=29, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), single field (nof=1) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few dependencies are listed. These metrics indicate the class is already small/cohesive and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
