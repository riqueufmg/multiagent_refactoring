    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of excessive size or complexity: loc=49, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=3. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies are referenced. These metrics indicate a small, low‑complexity holder/adapter that does not require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
