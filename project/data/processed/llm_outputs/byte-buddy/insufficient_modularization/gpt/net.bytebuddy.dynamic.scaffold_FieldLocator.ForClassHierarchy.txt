    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.ForClassHierarchy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=47, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method complexity (wmc)=0, number of fields (nof)=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no declared methods to split or reduce in complexity. Given these elements in isolation, there is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant modularization."
