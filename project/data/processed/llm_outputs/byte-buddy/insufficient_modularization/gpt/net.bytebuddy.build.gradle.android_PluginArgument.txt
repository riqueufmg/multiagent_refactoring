    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive. Metrics show LOC=70, NOM=7, WMC=7 and only 3 fields (NOF=3), indicating limited size and complexity. LCOM=0.0 indicates high internal cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is nil (DIT=0). Given these values, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently decomposed."
