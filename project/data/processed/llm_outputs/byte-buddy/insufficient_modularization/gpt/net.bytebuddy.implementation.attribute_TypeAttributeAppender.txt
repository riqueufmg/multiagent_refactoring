    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 164 LOC, other metrics indicate it is not insufficiently modularized: only 1 method (nom=1) and a low complexity (wmc=1) show simple behavior; LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion; there are 5 fields (nof=5) which is modest and consistent with a single responsibility implementation; fanout=0 and fanin=0 show no coupling pressure that would force decomposition. Based on these elements in isolation, further decomposition is not justified."
