    "justification": "Class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: very small size (LOC=22), minimal state (NOF=1), no methods reported (NOM=0, NOPM=0), negligible complexity (WMC=0), zero coupling (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0), and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and there is no evidence it needs further decomposition. Dependency list is a single plugin (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin)."
