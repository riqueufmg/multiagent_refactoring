    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.ForApi26LevelCompatibleVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: modest size (loc = 44), no behavioral complexity (nom = 0, wmc = 0), only two fields (nof = 2), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and no declared dependencies. These metrics indicate a small, simple, low‑coupling class that does not require further decomposition."
