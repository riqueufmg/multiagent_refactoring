    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: 82 LOC, 4 fields, 0 methods (nom=0) and WMC=0, indicating no internal method complexity. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low size and lack of behavioral complexity suggest it is likely a simple data holder or marker and does not require further decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
