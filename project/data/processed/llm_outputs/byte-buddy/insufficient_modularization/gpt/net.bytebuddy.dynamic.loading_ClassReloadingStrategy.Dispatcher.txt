    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=32, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 indicate no coupling pressure, and the single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) is minimal. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems in this context. Given the low size and complexity metrics, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
