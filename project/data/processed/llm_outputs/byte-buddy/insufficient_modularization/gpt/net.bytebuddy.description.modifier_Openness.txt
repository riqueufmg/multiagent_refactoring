    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: 46 LOC, 5 methods (nom=5), and WMC=5. It has a single field (nof=1) and no inheritance depth (dit=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LCOM=0.8 indicates only moderate cohesion, the overall size and low complexity do not justify further decomposition in isolation. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
