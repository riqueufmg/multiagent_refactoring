    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.ConstructorResolver.ForInstrumentedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and shows no internal complexity or members: loc=13, nom=0, nopf=0, nof=0, wmc=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence it has not been decomposed further or would benefit from additional modularization."
