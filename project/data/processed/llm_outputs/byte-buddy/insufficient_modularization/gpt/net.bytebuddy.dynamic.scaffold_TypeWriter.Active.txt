    "justification": "The class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=40, nof=1 (single field), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods/complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), dependencies=[] and lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion issues given absence of methods). These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
