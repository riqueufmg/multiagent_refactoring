    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: small size (loc=56), no methods recorded (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although it has 4 fields (nof=4), there is no evidence of large implementation complexity or responsibility clustering that would justify further decomposition."
