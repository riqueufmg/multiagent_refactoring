    "justification": "Class is small and has no internal complexity or many responsibilities: LOC=27, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. Coupling and usage are negligible (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). There are no methods to decompose and cohesion metric is not indicating fragmentation (LCOM=-1.0 likely due to no methods). Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
