    "justification": "Metrics show a small, low-complexity class: LOC=24, NOF=2, NOM=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. Dependency count is minimal (2). There is no indication of high implementation complexity or large size that would benefit from further decomposition; the LCOM value is not signaling cohesion problems. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
