    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is very small (LOC = 29), has a single field (nof = 1) and no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0), zero measured complexity (WMC = 0), and no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given this minimal size and lack of implementation logic, there is nothing to further decompose; the listed dependencies do not indicate internal size or complexity that would justify splitting the class."
