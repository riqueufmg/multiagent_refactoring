    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class unlikely to need further decomposition: LOC=44, number of fields=2, number of methods=0, WMC=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize). No indicators of high size or complexity or low cohesion that would justify 'Insufficient Modularization'."
