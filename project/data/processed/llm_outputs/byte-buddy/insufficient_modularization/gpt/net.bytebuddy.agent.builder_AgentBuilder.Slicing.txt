    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Slicing",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 174) combined with a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 10), indicating it likely holds multiple responsibilities or state. The absence of declared methods (nom = 0) and zero weighted method count (wmc = 0) together with the large LOC suggests the class body contains substantial implementation (initializers, anonymous blocks, or long method-like code) that has not been decomposed into smaller classes or methods. These characteristics (high LOC, many fields, lack of modular decomposition) support detection of Insufficient Modularization."
