    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=28, wmc=0, nom=0, nopm=0; low coupling and usage: fanin=0, fanout=0, only 3 listed dependencies; shallow inheritance (dit=1); no evidence of high cohesion problems (lcom=-1.0) or high complexity that would indicate it has not been decomposed. These metrics do not justify Insufficient Modularization."
