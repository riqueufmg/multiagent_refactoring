    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=28, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted methods complexity (wmc)=0, number of fields (nof)=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few external dependencies are listed. There is no indication of high size or complexity that would require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
