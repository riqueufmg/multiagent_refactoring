    "justification": "Metrics show no indication of a large or complex class that needs further decomposition: LOC=34 (small size), WMC=0 (no measured complexity), NOF/NOPF/NOM/NOPM=0 (no many fields/methods to split), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no wide coupling). Dependencies are limited to three related types. LCOM is -1.0 (no valid evidence of low cohesion). Given these values, there is insufficient evidence to justify Insufficient Modularization."
