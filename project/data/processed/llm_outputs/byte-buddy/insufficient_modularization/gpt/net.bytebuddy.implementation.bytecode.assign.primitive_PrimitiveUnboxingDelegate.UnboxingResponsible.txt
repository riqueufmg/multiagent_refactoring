    "justification": "The class is very small and low-complexity: LOC=13, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0. It has no fields or methods to decompose and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is not indicative (-1.0). Dependencies are minimal (2). Given its minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
