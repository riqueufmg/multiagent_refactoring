    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=33, NOM=0, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0, DIT=1. There are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no methods to decompose. Given the absence of internal complexity or size (no methods, zero complexity), there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
