    "justification": "The class shows no signs of excessive size or complexity: LOC = 52, number of fields = 3, number of methods = 0 (nom = 0), and weighted method complexity = 0 (wmc = 0). Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and it only depends on three types. There is no evidence of many responsibilities or high internal complexity that would indicate it needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
