    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 275) and high method-complexity (WMC = 42); very high number of fields/elements (NOF = 263) while having relatively few methods (NOM = 9, NOPM = 8) which suggests aggregation of many responsibilities/data into a single class; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 indicate it is self-contained rather than composed; cohesion metric LCOM = 0.0 provides no counter-evidence. Together these metrics justify decomposing the class to reduce size and complexity."
