    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.DoubleConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not overly complex: LOC=77, WMC=6, NOM=4, NOF=3. Although LCOM=0.75 indicates a potential cohesion concern, the overall size and method complexity are low and there are no external coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0, DIT=1). Given these metrics in isolation, there is insufficient evidence that the class has not been decomposed and would materially benefit from further modularization."
