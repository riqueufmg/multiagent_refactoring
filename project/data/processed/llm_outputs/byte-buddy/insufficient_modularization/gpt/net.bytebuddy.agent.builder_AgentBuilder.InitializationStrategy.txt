    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 354) while containing a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 8). Despite having no recorded methods (nom = 0) and zero coupling metrics reported (wmc = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0), the large LOC combined with multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) indicates the class likely aggregates multiple responsibilities or embedded implementation details that could be split into smaller, focused units. These elements (high LOC and multiple dependencies/fields) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
