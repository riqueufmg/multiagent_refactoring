    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=23, nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=1. There is only one listed dependency (AnnotationAppender). There is no evidence of high complexity, many methods/fields, or wide coupling that would suggest it has multiple responsibilities needing decomposition. Therefore, there is no indication of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
