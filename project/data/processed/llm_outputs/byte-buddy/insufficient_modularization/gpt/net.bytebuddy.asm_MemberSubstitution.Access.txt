    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Access",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=26), no methods or fields reported (nom=0, nof=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0). Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies are referenced. These elements show the class is small and simple, so further decomposition is not warranted."
