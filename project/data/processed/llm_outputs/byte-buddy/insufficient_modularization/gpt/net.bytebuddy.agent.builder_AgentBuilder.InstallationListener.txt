    "justification": "High size and low modular decomposition: LOC = 356 indicates a large class body that likely contains multiple responsibilities. nom = 0 (no declared methods) together with large LOC suggests logic is not cleanly decomposed into methods/units. wmc = 0 and lcom = -1.0 indicate no measured complexity but also point to low/unknown cohesion, supporting potential decomposition. fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 with a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) show low external coupling, so the class can be refactored into smaller modules without heavy coupling constraints. These elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
