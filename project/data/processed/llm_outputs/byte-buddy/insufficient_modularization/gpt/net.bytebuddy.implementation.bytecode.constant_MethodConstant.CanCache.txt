    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very small and simple in isolation (loc=10), no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), low complexity (wmc=0), shallow hierarchy (dit=1), no incoming/outgoing couplings (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. These metrics show no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
