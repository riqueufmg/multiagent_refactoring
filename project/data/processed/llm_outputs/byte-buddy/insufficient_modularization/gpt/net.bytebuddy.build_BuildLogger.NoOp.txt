    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: although LOC=71, the class shows no behavioral complexity or size indicators that would justify further decomposition — nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no method complexity), nof=0 (no fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), dependencies=[]. DIT=1 and lcom=-1.0 do not indicate cohesion problems. In isolation, the metrics show minimal responsibility and no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized."
