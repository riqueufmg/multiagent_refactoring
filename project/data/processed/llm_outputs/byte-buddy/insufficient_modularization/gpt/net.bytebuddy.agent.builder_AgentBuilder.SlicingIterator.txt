    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class: loc=72 (moderate size), wmc=0 and nom=0 (no internal method complexity or multiple behaviors to split), nof=4 (only four fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling suggesting separate responsibilities). lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion evidence available). Given the absence of method complexity and low coupling, there is no clear evidence of insufficient modularization."
