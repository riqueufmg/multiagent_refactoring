    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=22, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods to split (nom=0) and very low complexity (wmc=0), so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition. Dependencies listed do not imply internal size or complexity that would justify refactoring in isolation."
