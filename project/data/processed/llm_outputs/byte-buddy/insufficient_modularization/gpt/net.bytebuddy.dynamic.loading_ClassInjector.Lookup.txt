    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.Lookup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being too large or complex: LOC=25, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=0, weighted methods per class (wmc)=0, lack of cohesion metric (lcom) not indicating dispersed responsibilities. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) is listed. Given the class's small size and zero internal complexity, there is no evidence here of insufficient modularization."
