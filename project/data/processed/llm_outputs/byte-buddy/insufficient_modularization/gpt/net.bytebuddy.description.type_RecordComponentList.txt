    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has a large implementation size (loc=232) but very few methods (nom=3), indicating long, monolithic methods rather than decomposition; it defines multiple fields (nof=7) suggesting the class holds several responsibilities that could be split out; low WMC (3) reflects the small method count rather than fine-grained modularization; shallow inheritance (dit=1) and fanin=0 show no evidence of decomposition via subclasses or heavy reuse; the class also depends on several distinct types (RecordComponentDescription, TypeDescription, TypeList, FilterableList, ByteCodeElement, ElementMatcher), implying it coordinates multiple concerns that could be modularized."
