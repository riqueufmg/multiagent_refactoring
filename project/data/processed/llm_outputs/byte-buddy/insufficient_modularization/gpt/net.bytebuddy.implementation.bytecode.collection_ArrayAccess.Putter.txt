    "justification": "Class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=12), no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and contains no internal complexity that would benefit from further decomposition; listed dependencies do not imply internal size or complexity."
