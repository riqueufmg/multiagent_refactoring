    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modularized: it has very large size (loc = 1151) while having a relatively small number of methods (nom = 10), which indicates very long methods or many embedded responsibilities in a single file. It also declares many fields (nof = 20), increasing state complexity and suggesting multiple responsibilities that could be split. The dependencies include nested/inner types or role-specific components (AnnotationDescription.RenderingDispatcher, AnnotationDescription.Loadable, AnnotationValue, AnnotationList), which implies the class hosts multiple subcomponents or concerns instead of delegating to separate classes. Although WMC is moderate (wmc = 10), the combination of very high LOC, high field count, and the presence of internal component-like dependencies supports that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
