    "justification": "Metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization: LOC = 105 alone is not sufficient. The class reports nom = 0 (no methods) and WMC = 0 (no measurable method complexity), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no coupling evidence), and LCOM = -1.0 (cohesion not available). Given the class must be evaluated in isolation and there is no indication of many methods, high complexity, low cohesion, or coupling that would justify further decomposition, the smell is not detected."
