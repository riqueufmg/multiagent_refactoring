    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and non-complex: LOC=26, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPF=0, NOPM=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric is not indicating internal complexity (LCOM=-1.0). With no methods or fields and no dependencies, there is no evidence that the class has unresolved internal responsibilities that would require further decomposition."
