    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: low number of fields (nof=1), no methods recorded (nom=0), low size (loc=64), zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0) and zero fan-out (fanout=0). Dependencies are minimal (2). LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion rather than fragmentation. There is no evidence of large size or high implementation complexity that would justify further decomposition."
