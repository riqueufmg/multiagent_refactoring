    "justification": "Class is small and contains no implementation to decompose: LOC=40, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies are listed. Given the lack of methods/complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
