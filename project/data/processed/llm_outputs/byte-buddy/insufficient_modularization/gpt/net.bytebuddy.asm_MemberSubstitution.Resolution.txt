    "justification": "Metrics show the class is very small and non-complex: LOC=15, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=0, WMC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion data), fan-in=0, fan-out=0. There is no internal complexity or size indicating a need for further decomposition and coupling is minimal (only dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
