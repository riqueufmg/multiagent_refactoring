    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ResubmissionStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 449) and a high number of fields (nof = 27) indicating multiple responsibilities or state groups that could be split. Additionally, metrics show no reported methods (nom = 0) and an anomalous cohesion value (lcom = -1.0), which together suggest low or unclear cohesion and a likely opportunity to decompose the class into smaller, more focused classes. Dependencies are minimal, so decomposition would primarily affect internal structure rather than external coupling."
