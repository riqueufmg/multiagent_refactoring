    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 123 LOC, its structural metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: number of fields (nof=2) is very small, number of methods (nom=0) and weighted methods complexity (wmc=0) are zero, cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) is not indicating fragmentation, and coupling/frequency metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0, nc=0) show no heavy coupling. The presence of several declared dependencies does not by itself imply internal size or complexity that warrants modularization. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
