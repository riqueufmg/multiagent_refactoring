    "justification": "Moderate to large size (loc=157) with nontrivial state (nof=3) while exposing no methods (nom=0) suggests internal complexity or combined responsibilities that are not cleanly separated. The class depends on multiple distinct types (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin), indicating it handles several concerns. These factors (high LOC, several dependencies, state without clearly separated behavior) point to insufficient modularization and a candidate for further decomposition."
