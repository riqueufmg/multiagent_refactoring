    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: low size (loc = 52), no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc = 0). Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only one dependency is listed. Although there are 6 fields (nof = 6), the absence of methods and low overall complexity do not suggest an undecomposed, overly large or complex implementation. LCOM is not informative (lcom = -1.0). Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
