    "justification": "Class has low size and complexity: loc=25, nom=2, wmc=2. Cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0) and inheritance depth is minimal (dit=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its small number of methods and low complexity, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
