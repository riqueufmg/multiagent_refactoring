    "detection": false,
    "justification": "In isolation the class is small and simple: LOC=23, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted methods complexity (wmc)=0, number of fields (nof)=1, fanin=0, fanout=0. These metrics indicate no large size or implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. There is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or high cohesion/complexity that justify marking it as Insufficient Modularization."
