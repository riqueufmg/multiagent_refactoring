    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=27, number of fields=1, number of methods=0 (nom=0, nopm=0), WMC=0 indicating no internal complexity, and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=1 and LCOM=-1.0 reflect a trivial/inert structure rather than an undecomposed large class. These metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization."
