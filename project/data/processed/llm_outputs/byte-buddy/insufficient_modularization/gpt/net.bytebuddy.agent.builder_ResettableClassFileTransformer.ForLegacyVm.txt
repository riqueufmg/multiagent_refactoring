    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer.ForLegacyVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class appears minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=13, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), low complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of an oversized or complex class that would benefit from additional modularization."
