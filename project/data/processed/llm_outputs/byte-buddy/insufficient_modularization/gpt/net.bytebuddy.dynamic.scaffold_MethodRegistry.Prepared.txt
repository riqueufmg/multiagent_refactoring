    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.Prepared",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a large size (loc = 198) and a relatively high number of fields (nof = 12), which suggests multiple stateful responsibilities. It depends on many distinct concepts (13 listed dependencies including LoadedTypeInitializer, Implementation, TypeInitializer, MethodGraph, MethodDescription, MethodAttributeAppender, Visibility, ClassFileVersion), indicating it mixes several concerns. The cohesion metric is not positive/clear (lcom = -1.0), preventing evidence of strong cohesion. Taken together, the size, field count, and breadth of dependencies justify that the class likely can be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
