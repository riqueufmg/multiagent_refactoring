    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.TransformerIterator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: it has a non-trivial size (loc = 85) and a relatively large number of fields (nof = 7) while declaring no methods (nom = 0) and zero measured complexity (wmc = 0). This combination — substantial state held by many fields but no encapsulated behavior — suggests multiple responsibilities or a data bundle that could be split. Additional metrics (lcom = -1.0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and dependencies on two external types (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule) support the conclusion that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
