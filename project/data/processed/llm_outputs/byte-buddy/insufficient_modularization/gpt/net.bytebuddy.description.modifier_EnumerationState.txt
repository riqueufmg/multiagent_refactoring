    "justification": "Class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: it defines multiple methods (nom=5) with a moderate complexity (wmc=5) while having low cohesion (lcom=0.8), which suggests the methods are not closely related and the class may be implementing more than one responsibility. Although the file is not very large (loc=46), the combination of method count and high LCOM justifies decomposition. Additionally, fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate low coupling to other code, reducing the risk of refactoring into smaller, focused classes. Dependency list contains only ModifierContributor, so splitting responsibilities within this class is feasible in isolation."
