    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.ExtractableView",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc=68) but no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted methods complexity (wmc=0), only 3 fields (nof=3), no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These values suggest limited responsibilities and low internal complexity, so there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
