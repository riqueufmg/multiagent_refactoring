    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.Discovery",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: nom (number of methods)=7 and loc=60 indicate a non-trivial implementation size; wmc (cyclomatic/weight)=7 shows moderate complexity; lcom=0.8571428571428571 (high lack of cohesion) means methods are poorly related; nof (fields)=1 so methods do not share much state. These elements (high LCOM combined with multiple methods and moderate size/complexity) justify that the class should be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive units."
