    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=28, WMC=0, no methods (nom=0), single field (nof=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited. These metrics indicate the class is already simple and not a candidate for further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
