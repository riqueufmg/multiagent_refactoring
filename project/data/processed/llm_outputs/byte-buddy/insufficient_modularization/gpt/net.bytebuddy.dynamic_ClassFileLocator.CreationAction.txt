    "justification": "Metrics indicate no sign of insufficient modularization: loc = 18 (small size), nom = 0 and wmc = 0 (no methods/complexity to decompose), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no coupling suggesting hidden responsibilities), lcom = -1.0 (not indicating cohesion issues in this data). With no methods, no dependencies, and low size/complexity, there is no evidence in isolation that the class requires further decomposition."
