    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (LOC=28), has no methods (nom=0) and minimal state (nof=1), very low complexity (WMC=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and a single listed dependency. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem. These metrics show no need for further decomposition."
