    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity: LOC=13, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0. There are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no fields/methods to decompose. LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion concerns in the provided data. Given the minimal lines of code and zero complexity, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
