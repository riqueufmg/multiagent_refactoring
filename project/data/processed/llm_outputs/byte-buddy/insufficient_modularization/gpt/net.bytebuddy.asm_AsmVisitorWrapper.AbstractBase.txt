    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC = 17, number of methods (nom) = 0, WMC = 0, number of fields (nof) = 0, NC = 0, fan-in = 0, fan-out = 0, no dependencies. DIT = 1 and LCOM = -1.0 do not suggest internal complexity or poor cohesion that would warrant further decomposition. Given the minimal size and complexity in isolation, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
