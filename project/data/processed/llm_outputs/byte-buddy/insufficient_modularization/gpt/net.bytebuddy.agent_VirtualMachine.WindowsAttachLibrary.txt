    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=22, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, and no listed dependencies. The absence of methods/fields (NOM/NOF = 0) and zero complexity (WMC=0) show there is no sizable implementation to decompose; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
