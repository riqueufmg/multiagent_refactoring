    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has very large source size (loc=338) while exposing very few methods (nom=1) and low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=1), indicating a large amount of code that is not organized into instance methods. The dependency list includes multiple nested/related types (MethodAttributeAppender.Factory, MethodAttributeAppender.OnMethod, MethodAttributeAppender.Target) suggesting the file contains multiple responsibilities or inner types that could be separated. Having 6 fields and a large LOC with no inheritance (dit=0) further indicates the class is acting as a container for multiple concerns rather than being a single, well-factored unit — this matches Insufficient Modularization."
