    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingInstrumentation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 241) while reporting no method decomposition (nom = 0) and a nontrivial number of fields (nof = 8). This combination indicates functionality and state concentrated in a single unit rather than split across methods or helper classes. The absence of method-level granularity (nom = 0, wmc = 0) alongside high LOC strongly suggests the class is not sufficiently modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
