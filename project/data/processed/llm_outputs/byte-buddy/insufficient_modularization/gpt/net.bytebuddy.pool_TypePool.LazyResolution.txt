    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity: loc=34, nom=0 methods, nof=2 fields, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods to decompose and cohesion metric is not indicative of high internal complexity (lcom=-1.0). Given the low LOC, zero method complexity, and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
