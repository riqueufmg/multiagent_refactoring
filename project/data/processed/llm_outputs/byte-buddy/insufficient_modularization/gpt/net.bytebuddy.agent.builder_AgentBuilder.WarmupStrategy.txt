    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: although LOC is 127, the class has no methods (nom = 0) and no measured complexity (wmc = 0), very low field count (nof = 2), zero coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and no inheritance depth (dit = 0). These elements show no internal implementation complexity or size concentrated in many methods that would justify further decomposition."
