    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=48, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1. No incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two dependencies listed. These metrics indicate a single, cohesive responsibility and no evidence that further decomposition is needed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
