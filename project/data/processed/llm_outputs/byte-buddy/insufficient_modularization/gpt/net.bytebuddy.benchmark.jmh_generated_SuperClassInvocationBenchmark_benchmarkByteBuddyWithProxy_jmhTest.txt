    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: extremely high number of fields (nof = 263) while having few methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) and only moderate LOC (loc = 276). The weighted method complexity is relatively high (wmc = 42) given the small method count, indicating concentrated complexity. The disparity between a very large field set and few methods suggests multiple responsibilities or bundled state that could be split into smaller, more cohesive classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
