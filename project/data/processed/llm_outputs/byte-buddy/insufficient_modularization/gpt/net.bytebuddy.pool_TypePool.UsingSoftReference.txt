    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC=50 (moderate size) with no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), a single field (nof=1), zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. With no methods or measurable complexity to split, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
