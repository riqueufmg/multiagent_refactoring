    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Substitutor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large implementation size (loc = 313) while containing 8 fields (nof = 8) and 0 declared methods (nom = 0). The high LOC concentrated in a single class indicates it likely aggregates multiple responsibilities or large blocks of logic that could be split; the non-trivial state (fields) combined with concentrated code suggests further decomposition would reduce size and implementation complexity."
