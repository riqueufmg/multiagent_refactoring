    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyTypeVariable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively high number of fields (nof = 10) combined with a moderate size (loc = 117) while exposing no methods (nom = 0). This combination indicates concentrated state and likely multiple responsibilities that are not split into smaller cohesive units. Additionally, it has dependencies on multiple types (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool), suggesting it may be handling several concerns that could be decomposed into separate classes to reduce size and complexity."
