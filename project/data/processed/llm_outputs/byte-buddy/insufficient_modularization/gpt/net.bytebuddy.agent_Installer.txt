    "justification": "Metrics indicate low cohesion and non-trivial size/complexity for a single class. LCOM = 0.6 (suggesting low cohesion), LOC = 89 and WMC = 10 (moderate size and complexity), NOM = 5 with NOPM = 3 (multiple methods/public behaviors). NOF = 2 shows limited state but does not offset the low cohesion and method complexity. These elements together justify that the class likely groups multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed (insufficient modularization)."
