    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_baseline_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: extremely high number of fields (nof = 263) concentrated in a single class while LOC is 276 and number of methods is small (nom = 9, nopm = 8), indicating many attributes/responsibilities are not split into smaller types. Complexity is non-trivial (wmc = 42). Additionally, there is no inheritance decomposition (dit = 0, nc = 0) and no external coupling indicated (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), suggesting the class itself holds much structure/behavior that could be factored out. These elements together justify that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from modularization/refactoring."
