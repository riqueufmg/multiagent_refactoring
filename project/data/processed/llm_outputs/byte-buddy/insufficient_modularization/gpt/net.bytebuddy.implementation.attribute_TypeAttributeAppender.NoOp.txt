    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal complexity: LOC=12, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0. Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]), and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1). With no methods or fields to decompose, there is no evidence that further modularization would reduce size or complexity."
