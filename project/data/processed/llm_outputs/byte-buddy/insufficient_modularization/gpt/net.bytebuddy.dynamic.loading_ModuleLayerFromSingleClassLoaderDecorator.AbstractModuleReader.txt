    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=58, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1. Low coupling and isolation: NC=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0, dependencies=[]. With no methods to decompose and minimal size/complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
