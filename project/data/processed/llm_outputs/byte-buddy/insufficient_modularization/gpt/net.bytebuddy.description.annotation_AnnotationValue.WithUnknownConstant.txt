    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that is insufficiently modularized: loc=92 (moderate size), nof=4 (few fields), nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods to decompose), wmc=0 (no measurable complexity), lcom=-1.0 (no evidence of low cohesion from methods), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling pressure). Dependencies list is small. Overall there is no sign of excessive size, high complexity, many responsibilities, or low cohesion that would justify further decomposition."
