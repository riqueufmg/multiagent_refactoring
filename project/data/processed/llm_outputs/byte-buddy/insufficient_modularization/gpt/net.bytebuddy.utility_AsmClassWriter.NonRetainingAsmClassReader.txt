    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.NonRetainingAsmClassReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low complexity: LOC=58, WMC=0, NOM=0 and only NOF=1 field. It has minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency to net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion concerns in the provided data. Given the low size, no methods, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or that it requires further decomposition."
