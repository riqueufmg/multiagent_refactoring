    "justification": "The class does not show indicators of insufficient modularization in the provided metrics: loc is moderate (92 LOC) and WMC = 0 with nom = 0 (no methods) indicating no concentrated method complexity to decompose. It has 6 fields but no fanout/fanin (0), and LCOM = -1.0 suggesting cohesion rather than scattered responsibilities. Given the absence of method complexity or high size/complexity metrics in isolation, there is insufficient evidence to report Insufficient Modularization."
