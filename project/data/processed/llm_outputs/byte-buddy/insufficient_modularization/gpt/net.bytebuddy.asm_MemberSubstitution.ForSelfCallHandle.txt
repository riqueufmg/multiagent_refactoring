    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively large size (loc = 139) and a high number of fields (nof = 8) while exposing no methods (nom = 0), indicating concentrated state and implementation within a single class. It also depends on many external types (12 listed dependencies), which suggests multiple responsibilities or concerns being handled together. The combination of many fields, substantial LOC and numerous dependencies supports that further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
