    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=51, NOF=3, NOM=0, WMC=0, DIT=1, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. These metrics indicate minimal size, no measurable method complexity, and low coupling, so there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition (not an instance of Insufficient Modularization)."
