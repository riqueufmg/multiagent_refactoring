    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and simple (loc=35), has a single field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0), with zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0). Low coupling and usage (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (dit=0) indicate it does not exhibit the size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
