    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC = 86 (moderate size), WMC = 0 and NOM = 0 (no method complexity or many responsibilities expressed as methods), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no wide coupling), dependencies limited to 3 entries. Although NOF = 6 fields, the absence of methods/complexity and lack of high cohesion/complexity indicators mean there is no evidence here of insufficient modularization."
