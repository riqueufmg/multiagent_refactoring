    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.FieldSetter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of an undecomposed large implementation: fields=3 (nof=3) and methods=0 (nom=0), low complexity (wmc=0), moderate size (loc=79) but no behavioral complexity, high cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics provide no evidence that the class contains multiple responsibilities or excessive implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
