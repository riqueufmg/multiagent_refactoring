    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: the class is small and shows no signs of excessive size or complexity. LOC = 49 (low), WMC = 0 and NOM = 0 (no method complexity or large method count), NOF = 4 (few fields), fan-in = 0 and fan-out = 0 (low coupling), and only three dependencies. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
