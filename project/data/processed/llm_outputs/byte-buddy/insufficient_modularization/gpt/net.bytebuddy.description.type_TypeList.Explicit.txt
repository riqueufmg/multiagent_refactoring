    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=35, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 and only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). These metrics show low size and no internal complexity or responsibilities that would indicate a need for further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
