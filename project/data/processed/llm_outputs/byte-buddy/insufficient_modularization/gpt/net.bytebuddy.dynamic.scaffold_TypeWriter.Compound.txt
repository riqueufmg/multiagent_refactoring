    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Compound",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 152) while showing no method decomposition (nom = 0, wmc = 0). It contains only one field (nof = 1) and no external interactions recorded (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), which indicates internal implementation likely concentrated in a single, non-modular unit. Given the discrepancy between substantial LOC and absence of methods, further decomposition into smaller methods/classes is likely to reduce size and implementation complexity. Dependency list (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) does not contradict the need for internal refactoring."
