    "justification": "The class is small and focused: nom=4 methods and loc=72 indicate limited surface area. Complexity is moderate (wmc=9) but not excessive for 4 methods. Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.5), suggesting related responsibilities rather than multiple unrelated ones. Fan-in=0 and fan-out=0 show no evidence of broad coupling that would benefit from splitting. The listed dependencies correspond to returning type-specific constants (single, cohesive responsibility) rather than multiple distinct concerns. Together these metrics do not support further decomposition for insufficient modularization."
