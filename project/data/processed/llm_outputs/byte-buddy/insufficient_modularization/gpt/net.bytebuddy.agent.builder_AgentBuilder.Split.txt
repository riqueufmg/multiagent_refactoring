    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Split",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. It is small (loc = 63) with no declared methods (nom = 0) and no measured implementation complexity (wmc = 0). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and there is only a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType). LCOM is -1.0 (no meaningful cohesion data) but given the absence of methods and low size/complexity, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
