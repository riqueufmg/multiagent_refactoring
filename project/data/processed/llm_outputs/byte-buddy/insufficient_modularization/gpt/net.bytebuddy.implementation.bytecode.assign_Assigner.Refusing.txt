    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner.Refusing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=13, WMC=0, no methods/fields (nom=0, nof=0, nopf=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). These metrics indicate the class is already highly cohesive and lightweight, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
