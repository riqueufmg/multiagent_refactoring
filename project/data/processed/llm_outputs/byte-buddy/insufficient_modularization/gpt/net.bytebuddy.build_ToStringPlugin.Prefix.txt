    "justification": "Metrics indicate a very small, low-complexity class: loc=31, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.ToStringMethod). With no methods and negligible complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
