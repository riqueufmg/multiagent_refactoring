    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size (loc=236) combined with a high number of fields (nof=15) indicates the class holds substantial state and likely multiple responsibilities; very low/zero method and complexity metrics (nom=0, wmc=0) are inconsistent with the large LOC and suggest methods/behavior are concentrated or not well decomposed; the class depends on a variety of distinct concerns (Implementation, MethodDescription, Assigner, TypeDescription, StackManipulation), implying it handles multiple roles and interactions that could be separated; taken in isolation, these indicators point to Insufficient Modularization and that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
