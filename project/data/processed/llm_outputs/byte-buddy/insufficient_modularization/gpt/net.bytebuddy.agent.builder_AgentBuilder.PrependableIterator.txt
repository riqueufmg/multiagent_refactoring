    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0) and WMC=0, LOC=59 (moderate size), LCOM=-1.0 (no reported cohesion problem), fanin=0 and fanout=0, and no dependencies. There is no evidence of many responsibilities, high complexity, or low cohesion that would justify further decomposition."
