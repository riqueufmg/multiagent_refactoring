    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC is only 54, number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted method count (wmc) = 0 (no internal complexity), coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, single external dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList), and LCOM = -1.0 (no meaningful cohesion issues given absence of methods). Given the lack of methods, low size and complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
