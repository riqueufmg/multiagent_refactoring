    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=160 is moderate but nom=0 and wmc=0 indicate no measurable behavioral complexity; nof=10 fields with no methods suggests a simple data holder rather than an overlarge, multifunctional class; fanin=0 and fanout=0 and a single dependency (ModuleDescription) show low coupling; LCOM=-1.0 is not meaningful for cohesion assessment. Given these metrics in isolation, there is insufficient evidence to justify further decomposition."
