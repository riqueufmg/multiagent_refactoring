    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size and no implementation to decompose (LOC = 19, NOM = 0, NOF = 0), no complexity (WMC = 0), no coupling (FANIN = 0, FANOUT = 0), and no cohesion concerns (LCOM = -1.0 indicates no methods/fields). In isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
