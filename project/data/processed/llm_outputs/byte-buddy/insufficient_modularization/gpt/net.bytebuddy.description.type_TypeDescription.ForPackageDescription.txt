    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a non-trivial size (loc = 142) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and minimal fields (nof = 1), which suggests implementation is not decomposed into smaller, well-scoped methods or helper classes. The presence of many related type dependencies (TypeList, RecordComponentList, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, ModuleDescription, TypeDescription, MethodList, RecordComponentDescription, PackageDescription, FieldList) indicates multiple responsibilities or interactions that could be separated. Together these facts point to insufficient modularization: a relatively large class body with little internal modular structure and multiple external concerns that could be extracted to reduce size and complexity."
