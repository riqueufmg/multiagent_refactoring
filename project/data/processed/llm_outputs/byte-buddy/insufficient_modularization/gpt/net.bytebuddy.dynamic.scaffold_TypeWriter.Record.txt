    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Record",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 139) while reporting no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0) indicates functionality is not decomposed into smaller methods or helper classes. It has a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 3) and references many external concepts (19 distinct dependencies such as MethodDescription, FieldDescription, ByteCodeAppender, AnnotationAppender, RecordComponentAttributeAppender, etc.), suggesting multiple responsibilities. The combination of substantial LOC and heavy dependency usage without method-level decomposition justifies flagging this class as insufficiently modularized."
