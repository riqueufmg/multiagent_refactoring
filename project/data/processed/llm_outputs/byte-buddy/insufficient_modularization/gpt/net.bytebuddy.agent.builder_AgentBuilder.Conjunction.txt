    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Conjunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being too large or complex: LOC=42 (small), WMC=0, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). LCOM is not indicating cohesion problems (value -1.0 likely unavailable). Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
