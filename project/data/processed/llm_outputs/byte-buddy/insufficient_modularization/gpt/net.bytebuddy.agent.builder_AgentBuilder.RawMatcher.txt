    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.RawMatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size (loc = 254) combined with a relatively high number of fields (nof = 8) and no declared methods (nom = 0) indicates the class likely contains multiple responsibilities or embedded logic that has not been decomposed. Low external coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only two external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) mean it can be split without increasing system coupling. Although LCOM is reported as -1.0 (not informative), the high LOC with multiple fields and lack of method decomposition justifies flagging Insufficient Modularization."
