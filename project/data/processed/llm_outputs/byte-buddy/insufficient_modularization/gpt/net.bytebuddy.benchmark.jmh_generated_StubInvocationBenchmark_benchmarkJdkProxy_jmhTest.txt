    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very high field count (nof = 263) and relatively large size (loc = 276) indicate a monolithic data/implementation container that could be split. Complexity is non-trivial (wmc = 42) while the public surface is small (nom = 9), suggesting many data elements are managed by a few methods rather than separated into cohesive subcomponents. The combination of large number of fields and moderate complexity supports that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
