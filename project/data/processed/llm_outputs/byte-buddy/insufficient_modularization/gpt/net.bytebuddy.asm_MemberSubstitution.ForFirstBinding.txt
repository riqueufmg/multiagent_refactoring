    "justification": "Class has small size (loc=52), no methods (nom=0) and minimal internal complexity (wmc=0). It has a single field (nof=1), no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a highly cohesive profile (lcom=-1.0). These metrics indicate the class is simple and not a candidate for further decomposition, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
