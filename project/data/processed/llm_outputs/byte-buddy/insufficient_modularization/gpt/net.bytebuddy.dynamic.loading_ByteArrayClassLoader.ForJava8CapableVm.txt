    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.ForJava8CapableVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=48, NOF=3, NOM=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no methods or measured complexity to suggest a single large responsibility. Dependency list is minimal (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Based on these elements in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or requires further decomposition."
