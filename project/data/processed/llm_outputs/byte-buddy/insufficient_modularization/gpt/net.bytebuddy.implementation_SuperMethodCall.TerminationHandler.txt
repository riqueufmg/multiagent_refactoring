    "justification": "Class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=26), no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), no complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal in isolation and does not show signs of needing further decomposition."
