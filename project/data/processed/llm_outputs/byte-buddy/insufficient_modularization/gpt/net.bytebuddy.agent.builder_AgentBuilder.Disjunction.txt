    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Disjunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is not insufficiently modularized: small size (loc=42), minimal state (nof=1), no methods reported (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is negligible (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
