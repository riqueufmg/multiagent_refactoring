    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.NamedElement.WithDescriptor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: very small size (loc=19), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and shallow inheritance (dit=1). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
