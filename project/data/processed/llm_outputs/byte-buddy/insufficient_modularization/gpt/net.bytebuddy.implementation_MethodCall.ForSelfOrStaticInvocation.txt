    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: its size is modest (LOC=81) and it shows no implementation complexity (WMC=0, NOM=0). It has a small number of fields (NOF=3) and a highly cohesive structure (LCOM=-1.0). Coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and the listed dependencies are limited and thematic to its purpose. These metrics, considered in isolation, do not justify further decomposition."
