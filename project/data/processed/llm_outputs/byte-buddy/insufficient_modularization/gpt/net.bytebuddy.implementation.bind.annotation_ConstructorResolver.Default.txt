    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, simple class: loc=20, nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0, nopm=0. There is no internal complexity (wmc=0), no fields or methods to decompose, and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=1). Given these values, there is no evidence that the class has grown large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
