    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=29), a single field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0), zero cyclomatic/weight complexity (wmc=0), no inbound/outbound coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. These metrics indicate low implementation size and complexity and provide no evidence that it should be further decomposed."
