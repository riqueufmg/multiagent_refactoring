    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC is small (59), WMC = 0 and NOM = 0 (no evident method complexity or count), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (low coupling), and only a few dependencies are listed. In isolation there is no sign of large size or high implementation complexity that would motivate further decomposition."
