    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=43), no behavioral content to decompose (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0), few fields (nof=2) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the class has no methods and low complexity/coupling, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
