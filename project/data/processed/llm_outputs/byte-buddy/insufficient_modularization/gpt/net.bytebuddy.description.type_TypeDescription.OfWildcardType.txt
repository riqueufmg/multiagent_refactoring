    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modular: it has a large size (loc = 369) and a relatively high number of fields (nof = 10), indicating substantial state and implementation contained in a single class. Its dependency list spans many distinct concerns (TypeList, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, RecordComponentDescription, AnnotationSource, CachedReturnPlugin), suggesting multiple responsibilities and coupling to varied concepts that could be separated. These elements (high LOC, many fields, and diverse dependencies) justify refactoring into smaller, focused components."
