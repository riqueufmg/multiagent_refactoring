    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForDelegatingClassLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 168) combined with multiple fields (nof = 5) but no declared methods (nom = 0). A high LOC with nom = 0 and wmc = 0 suggests a monolithic block (likely large initializers or mixed responsibilities) rather than a decomposed, cohesive implementation. The class also depends on several external concerns (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), indicating multiple responsibilities that could be separated. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
