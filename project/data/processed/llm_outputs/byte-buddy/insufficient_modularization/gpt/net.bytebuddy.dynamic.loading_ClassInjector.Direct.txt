    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.Direct",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it has a large size (loc = 230) while exposing no methods (nom = 0) but holding state (nof = 6), indicating substantial implementation content that is not split into smaller methods/classes. Complexity/quality metrics are inconsistent (wmc = 0, lcom = -1.0) and there are no incoming/outgoing dependencies recorded (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), which together suggest the class contains considerable internal implementation that could be decomposed to reduce size and improve modularity."
