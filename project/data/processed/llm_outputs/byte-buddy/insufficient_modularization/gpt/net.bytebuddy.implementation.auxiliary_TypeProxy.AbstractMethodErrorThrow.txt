    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=31, nom=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=1. There are no methods to decompose (nom=0) and no measurable complexity (wmc=0). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although a few dependencies are listed, the provided metrics show the class does not exhibit size or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
