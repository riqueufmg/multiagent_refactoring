    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: LOC = 62 (not large), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods and no measured complexity), LCOM = -1.0 (no method cohesion to analyze), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (low coupling), single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). There is no evidence in the provided metrics of high size, high complexity, or multiple responsibilities that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
