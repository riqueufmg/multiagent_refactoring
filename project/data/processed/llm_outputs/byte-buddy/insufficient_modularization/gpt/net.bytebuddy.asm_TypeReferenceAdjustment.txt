    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class is likely insufficiently modularized: large size (loc=458) with a relatively small number of methods (nom=5, nopm=4) indicates very large methods or mixed responsibilities. It declares many fields (nof=10) combined with only moderate cohesion (lcom=0.4), which suggests multiple concerns packaged in one class rather than split into focused classes. The class also depends on a wide range of types (Implementation, AsmVisitorWrapper, FieldList/FieldDescription, TypeDescription, MethodList, ElementMatcher, OpenedClassReader, TypePool, etc.), implying it handles several responsibilities across different domains. Although complexity per method is low (wmc=5), the overall footprint and field count justify further decomposition to reduce size and clarify responsibilities."
