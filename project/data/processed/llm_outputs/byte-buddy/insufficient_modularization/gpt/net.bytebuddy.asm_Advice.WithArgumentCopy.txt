    "justification": "Class LOC = 117 indicates a non-trivial size that may benefit from decomposition; metrics for methods (nom = 0) and fields (nof = 0) are absent/unavailable (lcom = -1.0), preventing confirmation of high cohesion — given the substantial LOC and lack of decomposition indicators, the class is flagged as potentially insufficiently modularized and a candidate for further decomposition."
