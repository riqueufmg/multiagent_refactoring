    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: loc=51, nom=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion measure (lcom=-1.0) does not suggest dispersion. There are no methods to decompose (nopm=0), and field counts are minimal (nof=1, nopf=0). Given these values and the limited dependency set, there is no evidence this class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
