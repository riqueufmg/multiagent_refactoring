    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large number of fields (nof = 263) indicating it encapsulates a lot of state that could be split into multiple classes; non-trivial size (loc = 276) combined with high cyclomatic complexity (wmc = 42) meaning implementation complexity is concentrated in this single class; relatively few methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) with high overall complexity suggests methods are doing multiple responsibilities; although LCOM = 0.0 implies cohesion, the extreme field count and high WMC in isolation justify further decomposition to reduce size and complexity. Dependency list (1 dependency) does not mitigate the internal size/complexity indicators. Therefore, refactoring (splitting responsibilities, extracting helper/subject classes) is recommended."
