    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension.FieldAttributeVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=34), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0). It has a small number of fields (nof=3) and low cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0) but no operational contents to decompose. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and depth of inheritance is 0 (dit=0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
