    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 777) combined with a large number of fields (nof = 28) while having only one declared method (nom = 1), indicating a concentration of functionality and likely long methods/blocks. The dependency list includes many inner/related types (BindingResolver, MethodBinding, ArgumentTypeResolver, ParameterLengthResolver, Resolution, MethodNameEqualityResolver, Record, Illegal, Default, AmbiguityResolver, MethodInvoker, etc.), which implies the class encodes multiple distinct responsibilities and resolver strategies that would be better decomposed into separate classes. These metrics and the presence of many role-specific inner types justify that the class is not sufficiently modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
