    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.TokenizedGenericType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 264 (large size for a single class) and NOF = 19 (many fields), indicating significant internal state and implementation to manage. It also has multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The combination of high LOC and many fields, together with an uncertain cohesion indicator (LCOM = -1.0), supports that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
