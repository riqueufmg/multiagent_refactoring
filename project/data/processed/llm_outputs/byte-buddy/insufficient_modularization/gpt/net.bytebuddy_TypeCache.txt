    "class": "net.bytebuddy.TypeCache",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 369) and relatively high implementation complexity (WMC = 20) while exposing only a small number of methods (NOM = 8), which indicates large/complex methods that could be decomposed. It also contains several fields (NOF = 7) and multiple nested/dependent types (net.bytebuddy.TypeCache.StorageKey, .LookupKey, .Sort), suggesting multiple responsibilities bundled into one class file. Although cohesion is not strongly negative (LCOM = 0.25), the combination of high LOC, high WMC, few methods, and nested types justifies further decomposition to reduce method size and implementation complexity."
