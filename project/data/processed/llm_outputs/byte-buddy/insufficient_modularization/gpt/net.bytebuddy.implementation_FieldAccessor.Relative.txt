    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC is moderate (77), number of methods is 0 (nom=0) and WMC=0 indicating no internal complexity to decompose, number of fields is small (nof=4), cohesion metric is not indicating low cohesion (lcom=-1.0), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, only two declared dependencies). These elements together suggest the class is small, cohesive and low-complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
