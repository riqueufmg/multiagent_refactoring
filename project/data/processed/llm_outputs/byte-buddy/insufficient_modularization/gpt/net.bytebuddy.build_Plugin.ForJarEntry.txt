    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForJarEntry",

    "justification": "No evidence of Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc = 40), very low internal complexity (wmc = 0), no methods to decompose (nom = 0), small number of fields (nof = 2), no measured coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex and does not require further decomposition."
