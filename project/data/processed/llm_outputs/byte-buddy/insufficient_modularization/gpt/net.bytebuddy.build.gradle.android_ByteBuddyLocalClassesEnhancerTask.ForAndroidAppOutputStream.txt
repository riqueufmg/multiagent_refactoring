    "justification": "Metrics show no evidence of insufficient modularization: low size and complexity (loc=49, wmc=0), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), a single field (nof=1), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These indicators suggest the class is small and cohesive; there is no sign it should be decomposed further."
