    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, simple class: loc=49, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods (nom=0) and only a single field (nof=1), and few dependencies. Given its small size and low complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
