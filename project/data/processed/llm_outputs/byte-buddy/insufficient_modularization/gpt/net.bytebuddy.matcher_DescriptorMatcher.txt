    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, WMC=3, NOM=3 (NOPM=2) and LCOM=0.0. It has no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further or that further decomposition would reduce size/complexity."
