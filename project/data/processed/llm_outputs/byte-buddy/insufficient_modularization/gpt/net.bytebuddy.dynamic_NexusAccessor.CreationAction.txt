    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and non-complex: LOC=41, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0. Low size and zero measured method/field complexity implies there is no notable internal decomposition remaining to perform. Although five dependencies are listed, in isolation they do not indicate internal bloat or responsibility overload. Based on the provided metrics and dependency list, this class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
