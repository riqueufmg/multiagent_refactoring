    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: loc=36 (small class size), nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods to decompose), wmc=0 (no measurable complexity), nof=1 (single field), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling/dependencies). These values show the class is small and simple, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
