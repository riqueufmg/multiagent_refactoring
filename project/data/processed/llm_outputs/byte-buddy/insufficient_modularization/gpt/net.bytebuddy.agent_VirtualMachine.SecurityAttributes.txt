    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=20), low complexity (WMC=0), no methods (NOM=0), only 3 fields (NOF=3), zero fan-in and fan-out, and no dependencies. These elements suggest a simple/compact class (likely a data holder) rather than a class that needs further decomposition."
