    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=50), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), only 3 fields (nof=3), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. There is no evidence of high implementation complexity, high cohesion problems, or many responsibilities that would suggest further decomposition when analyzing the class in isolation."
