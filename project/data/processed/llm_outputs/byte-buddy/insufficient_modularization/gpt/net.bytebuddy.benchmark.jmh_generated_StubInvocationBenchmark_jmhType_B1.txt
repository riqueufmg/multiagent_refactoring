    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_jmhType_B1",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class reports an extremely high number of fields (nof = 256) while having zero methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and very small source size (loc = 18). WMC = 0 and NC = 1 indicate little to no behavior implemented in methods and a single large data holder. The concentration of many fields in one class (with fanin = 0 and fanout = 0, i.e., isolated) is a strong indicator that the class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
