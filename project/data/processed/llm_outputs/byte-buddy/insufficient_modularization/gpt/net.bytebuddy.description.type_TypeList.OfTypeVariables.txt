    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of being insufficiently modular in isolation: its size is moderate (loc=92) and complexity metrics are low (wmc=0, nom=0), indicating no concentrated implementation complexity to decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependency set is small (TypeDescription, TypeVariableSource, TypeDefinition, TypeVariableToken). Although it has six fields (nof=6), the absence of methods and low complexity metrics do not provide evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
