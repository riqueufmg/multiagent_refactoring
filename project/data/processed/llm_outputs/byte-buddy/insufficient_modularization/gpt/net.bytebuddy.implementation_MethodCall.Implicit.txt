    "justification": "Class is small and already simple: LOC=34, number of fields=1, number of methods=0 (nom=0), weighted method count=0 (wmc=0). Low coupling and usage: fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies only include two external types. No inheritance/children complexity: dit=0, nc=0. These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
