    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: moderate size and complexity (LOC=103, WMC=11, NOM=10) combined with very high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), no inheritance depth (DIT=0), and no coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence in the provided metrics that the class contains multiple unrelated responsibilities or is large/complex enough to require decomposition."
