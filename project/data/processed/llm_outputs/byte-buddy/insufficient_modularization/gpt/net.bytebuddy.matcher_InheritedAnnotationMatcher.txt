    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, WMC=3 (low complexity), NOM=3 (NOPM=2 public methods), and only 1 field (NOF=1, NOPF=0). LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling and dependencies are minimal (FANOUT=0, listed dependencies: ElementMatcher, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). DIT=0 and no children (NC=0). Given its low size, low complexity, and high cohesion when considered in isolation, there is no evidence that it should be further decomposed."
