    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Stubbing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=23, wmc=0, nof=0, nom=0. Coupling is minimal: fanin=0, fanout=0. Cohesion metric shows no cohesion problem (lcom=-1.0). Given the very small size, zero complexity and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that this class requires further decomposition (no insufficient modularization)."
