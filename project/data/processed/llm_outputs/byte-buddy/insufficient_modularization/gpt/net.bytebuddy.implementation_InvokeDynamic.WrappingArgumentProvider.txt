    "justification": "Evidence does not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (loc = 28), minimal state (nof = 1), no methods (nom = 0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc = 0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Dependencies exist but the class metrics show no internal complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition."
