    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC is only 53 (small size), WMC = 0 and NOM = 0 (no method complexity or many responsibilities), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling suggesting a large multifunctional class), and DIT = 1 (shallow inheritance). Although NOF = 3, the absence of methods and low complexity means there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
