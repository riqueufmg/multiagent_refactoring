    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is 72 (moderate size) with only 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods (nom=0) so there is no internal method-level complexity to decompose. Cyclomatic and complexity measures are nil (wmc=0), cohesion indicator LCOM=-1.0 does not suggest fragmented responsibility, and coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although the class references several types (listed dependencies), the internal metrics show low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
