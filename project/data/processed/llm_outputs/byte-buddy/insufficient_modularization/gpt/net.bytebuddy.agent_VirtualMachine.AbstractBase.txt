    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an overly large or complex class: LOC is 23, number of methods (nom) = 0, number of fields (nof) = 0, WMC = 0, fan-in = 0, fan-out = 0. DIT = 1 and LCOM = -1.0 do not suggest cohesion or inheritance complexity that would require further decomposition. Given the small size and lack of internal members, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
