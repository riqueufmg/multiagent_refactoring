    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.TypeCreation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=34), low complexity (WMC=4), few methods (nom=3, nopm=2) and only one field (nof=1). High cohesion (LCOM=0.0), no inheritance depth or children (DIT=0, NC=0), and minimal coupling observed (fanin=0, fanout=0). These elements suggest the class is already small, cohesive, and low-complexity, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
