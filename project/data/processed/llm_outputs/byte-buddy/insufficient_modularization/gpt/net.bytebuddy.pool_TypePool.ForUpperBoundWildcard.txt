    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large or complex class: LOC is moderate (92), number of fields is small (nof=6), there are no methods reported (nom=0) and weighted method complexity is zero (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low complexity, limited state and lack of many methods/responsibilities, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
