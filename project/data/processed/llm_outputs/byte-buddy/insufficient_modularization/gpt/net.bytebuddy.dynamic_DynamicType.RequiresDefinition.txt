    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is minimal and contains no decomposable responsibilities: LOC = 18 (small), number of fields (nof) = 0, number of methods (nom) = 0, WMC = 0 (no internal complexity), NOPF/NOPM = 0, fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no coupling). LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems in this context. Given the lack of fields, methods, and complexity, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
