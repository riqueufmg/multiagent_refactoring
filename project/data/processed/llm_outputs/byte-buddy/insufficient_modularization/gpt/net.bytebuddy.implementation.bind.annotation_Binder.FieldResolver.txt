    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 250) and a relatively high number of fields (nof = 10) for a single class, indicating it likely aggregates multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed to reduce size/complexity. Method-level metrics are not reported (nom = 0, wmc = 0) while the substantial LOC suggests internal implementation complexity that is not modularized. These elements (high LOC and many fields) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
