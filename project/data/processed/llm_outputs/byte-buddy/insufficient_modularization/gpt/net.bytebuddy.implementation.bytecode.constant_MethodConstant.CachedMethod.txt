    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low‑complexity: LOC=45, WMC=0, NOM=0. It has only 2 fields (NOF=2) and no methods to decompose (NOM=0/NOPM=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and LCOM indicates no cohesion problem. Given its limited size, lack of behavioral complexity, and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence that further decomposition (insufficient modularization) is needed in isolation."
