    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.StreamWriting",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has relatively large size (loc=114) while containing no methods (nom=0) and only two fields (nof=2). A nontrivial LOC count with zero methods indicates functionality is not decomposed into methods (or smaller collaborating classes), suggesting a single monolithic implementation. Supporting metrics: wmc=0, nc=0, lcom=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0 — together these point to lack of internal modular structure and therefore insufficient modularization."
