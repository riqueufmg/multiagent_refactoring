    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show a small, low-complexity class: LOC=43, NOF=3, NOM=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited to two known types. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem. Given the small size, lack of methods/complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed or would benefit from further modularization."
