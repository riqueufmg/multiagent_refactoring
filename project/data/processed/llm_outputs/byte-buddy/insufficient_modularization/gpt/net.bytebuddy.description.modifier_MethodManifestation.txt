    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=82, nom=8, wmc=8 indicate low size and complexity. LCOM=0.375 shows reasonable cohesion, and there are no incoming/outgoing coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single dependency (ModifierContributor). Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or that it requires further decomposition."
