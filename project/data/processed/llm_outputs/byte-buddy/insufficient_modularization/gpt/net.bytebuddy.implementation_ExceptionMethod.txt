    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.ExceptionMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear insufficient modularization: it has a moderate size (loc=145) with a small number of methods (nom=8) and fields (nof=6), a modest complexity (wmc=10) and average cohesion (lcom=0.5). Inheritance is shallow (dit=1) and there is no measured external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics the class is not overly large or complex and does not present strong evidence that it should be further decomposed."
