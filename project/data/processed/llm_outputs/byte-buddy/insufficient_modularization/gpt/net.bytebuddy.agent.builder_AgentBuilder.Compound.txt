    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 136 LOC, it has no methods (nom=0), no measured complexity (wmc=0), only 4 fields (nof=4), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. These metrics indicate low internal complexity and low coupling, so there is no clear evidence that the class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
