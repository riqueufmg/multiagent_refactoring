    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 142 (large size), NOF = 11 (many fields) while NOM = 0 and NOPM = 0 (no methods), WMC = 0 (no measured method complexity) and LCOM = -1.0 (indicates very low/undefined cohesion). The combination of substantial size and many fields with no methods and low cohesion suggests the class has not been decomposed and could be split into smaller, more focused classes."
