    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: very small size (loc=12), no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0) and no package-private fields/methods (nopf=0, nopm=0), zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). LCOM is -1.0 (no meaningful cohesion data). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
