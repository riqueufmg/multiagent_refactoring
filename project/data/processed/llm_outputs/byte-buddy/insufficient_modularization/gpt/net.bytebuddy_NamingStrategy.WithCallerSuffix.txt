    "class": "net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy.WithCallerSuffix",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and not complex (loc=36, wmc=0), defines no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), has minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics show no evidence that the class is large or sufficiently complex to require further decomposition; LCOM value (-1.0) indicates no meaningful cohesion data to suggest modularization issues."
