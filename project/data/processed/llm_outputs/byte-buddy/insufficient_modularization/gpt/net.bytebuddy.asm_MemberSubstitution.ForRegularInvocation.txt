    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: loc=47, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=1, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods (nom=0) and zero measured cognitive/structural complexity, so there is no evidence of a large, multi-responsibility implementation that would benefit from further decomposition. The limited set of dependencies does not suggest excessive coupling or mixed responsibilities. Therefore, based on the provided isolated metrics, Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
