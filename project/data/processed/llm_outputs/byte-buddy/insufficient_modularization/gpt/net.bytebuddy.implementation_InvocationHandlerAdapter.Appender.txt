    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=22, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=1 (one field). It shows no coupling pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low inheritance depth (DIT=1). Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0) and it has only a few external dependencies. Given its minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence it requires further decomposition."
