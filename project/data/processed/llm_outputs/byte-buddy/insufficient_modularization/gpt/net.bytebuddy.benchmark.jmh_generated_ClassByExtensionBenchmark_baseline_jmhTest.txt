    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large number of fields (nof = 263) and large size (loc = 276) indicate excessive state and responsibilities concentrated in one class. Complexity is relatively high (wmc = 42) while having a moderate number of methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8), suggesting bulky implementation per method and/or many internal concerns. These metrics together justify that further decomposition could reduce class size and implementation complexity."
