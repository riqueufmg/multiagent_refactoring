    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that is insufficiently modularized: LOC = 40 (small size), NOF = 2 and NOM = 0 (only two fields and no methods), WMC = 0 (no implementation complexity), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no coupling activity), single dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These elements show the class is small and simple in isolation, so there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
