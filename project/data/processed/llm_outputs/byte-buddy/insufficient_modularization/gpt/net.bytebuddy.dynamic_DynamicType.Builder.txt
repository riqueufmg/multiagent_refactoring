    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: extremely large size (loc = 4407) and a very high number of fields (nof = 60) which indicate many responsibilities and state. It also depends on a large and diverse set of types (e.g. net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldRegistry, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy, ...), implying multiple concerns are handled within this single class. Taken in isolation, these metrics (loc and nof) and the broad dependency surface justify that the class should likely be decomposed into smaller, focused modules to reduce size and complexity."
