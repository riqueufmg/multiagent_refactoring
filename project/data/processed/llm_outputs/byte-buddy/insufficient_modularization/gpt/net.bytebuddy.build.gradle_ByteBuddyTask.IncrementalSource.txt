    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: modest size (LOC=66), few fields (nof=4), no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0) suggest low internal complexity. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one dependency listed (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin). LCOM value is non-informative (-1.0) but other measures show no evidence that the class is large or doing multiple responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition."
