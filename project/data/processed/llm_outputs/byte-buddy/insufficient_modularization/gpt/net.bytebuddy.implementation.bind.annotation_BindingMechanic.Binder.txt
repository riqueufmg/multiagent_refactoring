    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: loc=39, wmc=0, nof=2, nom=0, nopm=0. Low coupling and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (dit=0). LCOM=-1.0 provides no evidence of poor cohesion. There are no methods to decompose (nom=0) and overall size/complexity do not indicate need for further decomposition."
