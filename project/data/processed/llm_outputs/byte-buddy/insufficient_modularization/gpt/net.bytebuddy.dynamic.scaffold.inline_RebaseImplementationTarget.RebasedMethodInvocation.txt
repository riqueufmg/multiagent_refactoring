    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, large or complex class: LOC = 87 (moderate size), NOF = 4 fields, NOM = 0 methods, WMC = 0, fan-in = 0, fan-out = 0. Low method count and zero complexity suggest the class is small/simple in isolation. Dependency set is limited. Based on these elements, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
