    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy.SealBaseLocator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class appears large and a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 127 and number of fields (nof) = 7 indicate substantial size/state. At the same time nom = 0 and wmc = 0 show no method-level decomposition (no methods reported) so implementation logic/state is concentrated in a single class body. These metrics (high LOC with many fields and no methods) suggest the class combines multiple responsibilities and has not been sufficiently modularized, so decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
