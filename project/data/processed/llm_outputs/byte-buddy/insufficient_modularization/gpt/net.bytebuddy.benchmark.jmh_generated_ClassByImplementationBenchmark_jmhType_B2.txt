    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an oversized or complex class that needs decomposition: loc=14 (small), wmc=0 (no complexity), nom=0 (no methods), nc=1, dit=2. Although it has 12 fields (nof=12), the absence of methods (nom=0) and LCOM=-1.0 (not meaningful with no methods) and fanin/fanout=0 suggest the class is a simple data holder/marker with low implementation complexity; there is insufficient evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
