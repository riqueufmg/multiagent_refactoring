    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.specimen.ExampleInterface",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The interface is likely insufficiently modular: it declares 18 methods (nom = 18) and spans 131 lines of code (loc = 131) with a weighted method count of 18 (wmc = 18). These values indicate a large, complex API surface concentrated in a single type. There are no fields (nof = 0) and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), so the size/complexity arises from many operations on the same interface rather than state or coupling—suggesting it can be decomposed into smaller, cohesive interfaces."
