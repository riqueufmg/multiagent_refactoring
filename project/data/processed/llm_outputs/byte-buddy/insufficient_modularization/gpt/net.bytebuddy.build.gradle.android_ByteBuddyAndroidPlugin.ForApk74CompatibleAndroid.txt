    "justification": "The class shows no behavioral complexity to decompose: NOM (number of methods) = 0 and WMC = 0 indicate no methods/complex logic to split. Fan-in = 0 and Fan-out = 0 (single listed dependency) show low coupling. Although LOC = 97 and NOF = 5 (fields) indicate some size, the absence of methods and low complexity/coupling means there is no clear undecomposed implementation responsibility; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
