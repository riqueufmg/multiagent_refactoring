    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.ForExactType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=50, nof=2, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no methods or measured complexity to suggest a large or monolithic implementation. Given these values and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
