    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has 9 methods (nom = 9) with 8 publicly accessible methods (nopm = 8) exposing a relatively large interface for a single class, and 111 lines of code (loc = 111). Its weighted methods per class is high (wmc = 21), indicating concentrated implementation complexity that could be split. Cohesion is moderate (lcom = 0.444), suggesting the methods are not tightly focused on a single cohesive responsibility. Taken together (high WMC, multiple public methods, moderate cohesion), these metrics justify that the class could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
