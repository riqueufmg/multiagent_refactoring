    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=26, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPM=0 and fanin/fanout=0. There is only one dependency (ClassLoadingStrategy). These values show low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence the class requires further decomposition."
