    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple (loc=23) with no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (dit=0). Given its minimal size and lack of implementation complexity, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
