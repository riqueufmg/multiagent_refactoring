    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, low-complexity class: LOC=13, WMC=0, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. There are no dependencies and no measurable cohesion issues (lcom=-1.0 is non-significant here). Given the minimal size and lack of responsibilities, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized."
