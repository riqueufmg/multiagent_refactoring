    "justification": "High size and state: LOC = 370 and number of fields (nof) = 14 while number of methods (nom) = 0. The large line count combined with many fields indicates the class is large and likely mixes responsibilities, suggesting it has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from modularization."
