    "justification": "The class does not show signs of being a large, monolithic unit: number of methods is 0 (nom=0), cyclomatic complexity is 0 (wmc=0), it has only 3 fields (nof=3) and a modest size (loc=64). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
