    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_jmhType_B1",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High number of fields (nof = 256) combined with zero methods (nom = 0) and very small LOC (18) indicates the class holds a large amount of data/structure without behavior decomposition. wmc = 0 and minimal inheritance (dit = 1, nc = 1) show no internal modularization into methods or subcomponents. These elements together suggest the class is insufficiently decomposed and should be split into smaller, focused classes."
