    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeReferenceAdjustment.TypeReferenceMethodVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a moderate size (loc = 117) while metric counts for methods and fields are zero (nom = 0, nof = 0) and cyclomatic weight is zero (wmc = 0). This combination indicates code is concentrated rather than decomposed into distinct methods or smaller collaborating units. The lack of measured method/field decomposition together with non-trivial LOC suggests the class has not been sufficiently modularized and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
