    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small implementation and low complexity: nom (methods) = 1, wmc = 1, loc = 72. Cohesion appears high (lcom = -1.0). It has only a few fields (nof = 3) and no external coupling or usage indicated (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and no inheritance depth (dit = 0). Given the minimal size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
