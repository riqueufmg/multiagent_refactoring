    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.ConstructorResolver.Instantiation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc=66), low structural complexity (wmc=0, nom=0), small number of fields (nof=4) and no coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is not overly large or complex and does not require further decomposition based on the provided data."
