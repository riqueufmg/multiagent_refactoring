    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.AssignerConfigurable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small size (loc=12) and no measured complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single dependency on net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner. Inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1) and cohesion metric indicates cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Given the low size, low complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
