    "justification": "LOC = 378 (large size) combined with NOF = 11 (many fields) indicates a substantial amount of implementation concentrated in this single class. NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no/low measured method decomposition or complexity metrics) together with an isolated fanin/fanout = 0 suggest the class's implementation is not decomposed into smaller methods or collaborating classes. These elements (high LOC and field count with little measured modular decomposition) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
