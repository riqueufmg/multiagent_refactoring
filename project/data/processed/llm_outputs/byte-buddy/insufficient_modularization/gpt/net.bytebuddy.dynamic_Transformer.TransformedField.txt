    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.TransformedField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, monolithic class: LOC is modest (70), number of fields is small (nof=4), there are no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and cyclomatic/implementation complexity is zero (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited to three type descriptions. LCOM is not meaningful here (lcom=-1.0). Given the small size, lack of internal complexity and low coupling, there is no evidence that this class requires further decomposition."
