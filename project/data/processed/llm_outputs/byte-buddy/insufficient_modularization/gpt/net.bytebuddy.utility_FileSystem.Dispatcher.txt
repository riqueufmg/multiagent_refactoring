    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: loc=12, nof=0 (no fields), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion issues reported), fanin=0, fanout=0, and only a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). These metrics indicate minimal size and responsibility, so there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
