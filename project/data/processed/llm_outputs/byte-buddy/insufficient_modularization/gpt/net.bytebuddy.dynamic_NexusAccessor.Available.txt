    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor.Available",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: it has only 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods (nom=0), very low implementation complexity (wmc=0), zero incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and a modest size (loc=56). Dependency list is a single build/plugin entry. These metrics indicate a small, simple unit rather than a large, undecomposed class, so further decomposition is not indicated."
