    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=44, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, LCOM=-1.0. Low size (LOC) and zero methods/complexity and no coupling suggest there is no need for further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
