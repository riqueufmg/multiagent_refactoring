    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 556) while exposing very few methods (nom = 2) and a low cyclomatic complexity (wmc = 2). It also holds many fields (nof = 20), which combined with few methods implies a monolithic implementation (likely long methods or bundled responsibilities) that has not been decomposed. The dependencies listing nested types (AnnotationAppender.Default, AnnotationAppender.Target) further indicates multiple responsibilities grouped under this class. These elements (high LOC, high field count, low method count) justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is detected."
