    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: LOC = 235 (large size for a single class) while number of methods nom = 5 and number of public methods nopm = 3 (few methods, implying large/complex method bodies). Cyclomatic/weight metric wmc = 14 indicates concentrated complexity. Cohesion lcom = 0.4 is only moderate, suggesting responsibilities are not tightly focused. Number of fields nof = 8 relative to few methods further implies multiple responsibilities/state packed into one class. The presence of nested/internal types in the dependency list (ArrayFactory.ArrayCreator, ArrayFactory.ForPrimitiveType) indicates partial decomposition but not sufficient to keep the main class small. Together these elements justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
