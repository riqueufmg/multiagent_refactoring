    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=17, WMC=0, NOF=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0. Cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 (no meaningful cohesion issues reported). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Given the very low size and complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
