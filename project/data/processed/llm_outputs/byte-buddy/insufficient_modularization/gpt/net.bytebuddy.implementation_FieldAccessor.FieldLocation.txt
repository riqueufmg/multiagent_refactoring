    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.FieldLocation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc=145) while declaring no methods (nom=0) and holding multiple fields (nof=5), indicating a concentrated implementation body; cohesion metric is problematic (lcom=-1.0) suggesting responsibilities are not well separated; it depends on multiple distinct concerns (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator), implying the class mixes responsibilities (equals/hash, field description, field locating); low external interaction (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests the complexity is internal rather than delegated. These elements together justify decomposing the class to reduce size and implementation complexity."
