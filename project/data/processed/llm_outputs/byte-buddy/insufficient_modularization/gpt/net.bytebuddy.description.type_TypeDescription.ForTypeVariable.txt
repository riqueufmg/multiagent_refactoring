    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=54), has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), minimal state (nof=1), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no indicated cohesion problem (lcom=-1.0). It has only a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics do not justify further decomposition."
