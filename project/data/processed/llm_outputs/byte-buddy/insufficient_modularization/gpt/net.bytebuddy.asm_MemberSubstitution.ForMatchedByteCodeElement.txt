    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMatchedByteCodeElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular in isolation: very small size (loc = 28), no methods (nom = 0) and minimal state (nof = 1), zero complexity (wmc = 0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). The provided cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) and listed dependencies do not indicate a need for further decomposition. These metrics collectively show the class is already simple and does not warrant decomposition."
