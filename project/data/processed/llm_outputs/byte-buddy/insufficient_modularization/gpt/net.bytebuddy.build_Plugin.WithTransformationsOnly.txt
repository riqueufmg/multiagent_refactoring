    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: the class is small (LOC=34), has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0), very low field count (nof=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single external dependency. LCOM is -1.0 (no meaningful cohesion issue given absence of methods). There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or poor cohesion that would justify further decomposition."
