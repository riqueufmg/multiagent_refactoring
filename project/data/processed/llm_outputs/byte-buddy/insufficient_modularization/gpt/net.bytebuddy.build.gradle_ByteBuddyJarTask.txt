    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyJarTask",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear signs of Insufficient Modularization when considered in isolation. Although it has 14 methods (nom = 14) and 105 LOC, its cyclomatic/weight measure is moderate (wmc = 15) and it has only 4 fields (nof = 4), which keeps internal surface limited. Cohesion is reasonably high (lcom = 0.2857142857), indicating the methods are related and the class likely represents a single responsibility. Inheritance depth is shallow (dit = 1) and there are no incoming or outgoing coupling indications in the provided data (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Taken together, these metrics do not justify further decomposition solely based on the provided measurements."
