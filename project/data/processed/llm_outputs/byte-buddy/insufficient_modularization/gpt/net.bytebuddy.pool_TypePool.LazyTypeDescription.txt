    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyTypeDescription",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=31), only 2 fields (NOF=2), no methods (NOM=0) and no public fields (NOPF=0), zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC=0), zero inheritance depth (DIT=0), zero fan-in/fan-out (no coupling indication). These metrics indicate the class is small, simple and sufficiently focused, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
