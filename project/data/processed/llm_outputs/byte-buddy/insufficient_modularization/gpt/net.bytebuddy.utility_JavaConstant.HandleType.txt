    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.HandleType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows low structural and behavioral complexity: only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), WMC=0 and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LOC=127, the absence of methods and very low coupling/dependencies (only 2 listed) indicate it is not doing multiple responsibilities that require further decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
