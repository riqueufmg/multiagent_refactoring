    "justification": "The class does not show indicators of an incompletely decomposed implementation: nom=0 and wmc=0 indicate no internal method complexity or many behaviors to split; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate no coupling that would suggest mixed responsibilities; nof=5 is a modest field count and alone does not imply excessive size or responsibility; LOC=100 is moderate but not sufficient by itself to prove insufficient modularization. LCOM=-1.0 is ambiguous here and does not provide evidence of poor cohesion. Overall the provided metrics do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
