    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Symbolic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively large size (loc = 191) while the structural counts are low (nof = 2, nom = 0), suggesting concentrated implementation rather than clear decomposition. It also depends on a broad set of distinct responsibilities (dependencies include TypeList, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, RecordComponentDescription, StackSize, AnnotationSource), indicating multiple concerns within the same class. The combination of high LOC and wide dependency spread, with few fields/methods reported, supports that this class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
