    "class": "net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy.Suffixing",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large physical size (loc = 166) combined with a non-trivial field count (nof = 7), which indicates it may be handling multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed further. Method- and complexity-related metrics are absent or zero (nom = 0, wmc = 0), so despite missing complexity detail, the high LOC and field count justify flagging possible insufficient modularization."
