    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.WithTransformationsOnly",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: 22 LOC, 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There is only a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate low size, low complexity, and no evidence of multiple responsibilities, so there is no indication that the class requires further decomposition."
