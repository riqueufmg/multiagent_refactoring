    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.OfFieldValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: small size (loc=55), only one field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no signs of multiple responsibilities to split. Given these elements, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
