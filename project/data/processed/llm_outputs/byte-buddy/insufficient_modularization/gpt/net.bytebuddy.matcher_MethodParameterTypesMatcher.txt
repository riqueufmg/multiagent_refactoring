    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive, so further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity. Metrics: loc=26 (small size), nom=3 and nopm=2 (few methods), wmc=3 (low cyclomatic/implementation complexity), lcom=0.0 (high cohesion). Additional indicators: nof=1 (minimal fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling pressure in the provided isolation), dit=0. These values do not show the large size, high complexity, or low cohesion typical of Insufficient Modularization."
