    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.WithExplicitType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: small size (loc=25), minimal state (nof=1, nopf=0) and no methods to decompose (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0). Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric does not indicate fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). Although there are several declared dependencies, their presence alone does not imply the class should be further decomposed. Based on the provided per-class metrics in isolation, no further decomposition is warranted."
