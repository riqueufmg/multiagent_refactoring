    "justification": "The class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is very small (loc=21), declares no fields (nof=0) and no methods (nom=0), has zero measured complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and has no dependencies. There is no internal structure or size/complexity to decompose further."
