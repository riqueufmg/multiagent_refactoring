    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithoutExceptionHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has small size and no internal structure to decompose: LOC = 23, NOM = 0, NOF = 0, WMC = 0, NC = 0. No incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and no measurable methods or fields indicating high implementation complexity. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
