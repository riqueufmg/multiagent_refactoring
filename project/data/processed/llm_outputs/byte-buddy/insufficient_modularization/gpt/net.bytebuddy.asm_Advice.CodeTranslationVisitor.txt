    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.CodeTranslationVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc: 218) combined with a high number of fields (nof: 16) indicates substantial internal state and responsibilities concentrated in a single class. It depends on multiple external types (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize), suggesting it coordinates several concerns. The reported low method count (nom: 0) alongside high LOC implies logic is not well-decomposed into smaller methods or helper classes. These elements together justify that further decomposition (splitting responsibilities, extracting helper classes or visitors) would likely reduce size and complexity."
