    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No insufficient modularization detected: class shows small size and no measured internal complexity (loc=59, wmc=0, nom=0) and a small field count (nof=3). Coupling metrics do not indicate spreading of responsibilities (fanin=0, fanout=0). Cohesion metric is unavailable (lcom=-1.0) but the absence of methods/complexity and low coupling provide no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
