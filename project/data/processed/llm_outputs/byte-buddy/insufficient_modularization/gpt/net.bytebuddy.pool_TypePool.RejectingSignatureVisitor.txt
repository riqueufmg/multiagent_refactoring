    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.RejectingSignatureVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient decomposition: it is relatively large (loc = 111) while exposing no methods (nom = 0) and only one field (nof = 1). Complexity/structure metrics (wmc = 0, lcom = -1.0) and zero reported coupling activity (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) indicate the class contains substantial implementation without method-level modularization. The combination of high LOC with no method decomposition justifies flagging Insufficient Modularization."
