    "justification": "The class is small and non-complex: LOC = 27, WMC = 0, no methods (nom = 0) and no fields (nof = 0). Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and there are no dependencies. Given the lack of size, behavior, or internal structure to decompose, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
