    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 11, WMC = 0, no methods/fields reported (nof/nopf/nom/nopm = 0), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0, and only a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant). DIT = 1 indicates a minimal inheritance level and LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate poor cohesion in this context. These metrics show low size and complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
