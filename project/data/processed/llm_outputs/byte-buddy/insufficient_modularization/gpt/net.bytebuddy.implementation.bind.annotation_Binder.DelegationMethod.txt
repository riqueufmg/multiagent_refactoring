    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=41 (small), NOF=3, NOM=0 (no methods to split), WMC=0 (no complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (cohesion not problematic), DIT=1, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. Dependency list is small (4). The class is small, low-complexity and has no evidence of being a large, monolithic unit that requires further decomposition."
