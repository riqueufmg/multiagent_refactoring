    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The nested class has substantial size (loc = 101) and 6 fields (nof = 6) but reports 0 methods (nom = 0) and WMC = 0. A relatively large source size with no method-level decomposition indicates behavior and complexity are not factored into smaller units. The presence of multiple external dependencies (several referenced types) alongside high LOC and no methods supports that the class is likely combining responsibilities and would benefit from further decomposition (splitting into additional methods or helper classes) — therefore insufficient modularization is detected."
