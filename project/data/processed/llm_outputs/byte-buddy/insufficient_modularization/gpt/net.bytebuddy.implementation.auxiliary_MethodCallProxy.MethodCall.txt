    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.MethodCallProxy.MethodCall",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: it has modest size (loc=62), no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/behavioral complexity (wmc=0), only three fields (nof=3), zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0), and a strongly cohesive LCOM value (-1.0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
