    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small size (loc=41), very low structural complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0) and only two fields (nof=2). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no evidence of high implementation complexity or many responsibilities. Based on these elements the class does not show signs that it should be further decomposed."
