    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.NullMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=27), very few methods (nom=3, nopm=3), low complexity (WMC=3), minimal fields (nof=1), no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LCOM=1.0 could indicate low cohesion, given the overall tiny scale and low complexity of the class, there is no evidence it should be further decomposed."
