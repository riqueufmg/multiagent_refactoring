    "justification": "Metrics indicate no need for further decomposition: loc=40 (small size), wmc=0 and nom=0 (no measurable methods/complexity to split), nopm=0, fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling pressure), lcom=-1.0 (not applicable). Only two listed dependencies. Given the absence of methods/complexity and low size/coupling, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
