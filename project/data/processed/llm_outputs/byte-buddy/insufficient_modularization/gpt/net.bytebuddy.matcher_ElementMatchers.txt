    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: extremely high number of methods (nom = 198, nopm = 197) meaning almost all methods are public, very large size (loc = 1785), and high cyclomatic/maintenance complexity (wmc = 207). The class depends on a wide variety of unrelated types (many matcher-related and description-related dependencies), indicating multiple responsibilities consolidated into one class. dit = 0 (no inheritance used to distribute behavior) and the sheer volume of API surface suggest it should be decomposed into smaller, focused classes or modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
