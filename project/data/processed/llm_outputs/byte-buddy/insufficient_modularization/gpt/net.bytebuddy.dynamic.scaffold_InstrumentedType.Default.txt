    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected due to concentrated size and multiple responsibilities in a single class: large LOC (856) and high number of fields (nof = 24) indicate substantial internal complexity; the dependency set spans many distinct concerns (e.g. MethodDescription, FieldDescription, AnnotationList, RecordComponentDescription, TypeInitializer, ModuleDescription, PackageDescription, LoadedTypeInitializer, TargetType), implying handling of methods, fields, annotations, record components, type initialization, module/package metadata and loaded-type behavior. These facts (considering the class in isolation) strongly suggest the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization to reduce size and separate responsibilities."
