    "justification": "The class has moderate size (loc=101) but contains no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and only a small number of fields (nof=3). Coupling metrics show no incoming or outgoing usage (fanin=0, fanout=0). The absence of behavioral complexity or high coupling indicates there is no evidence that the class has undecomposed functionality that would benefit from further modularization."
