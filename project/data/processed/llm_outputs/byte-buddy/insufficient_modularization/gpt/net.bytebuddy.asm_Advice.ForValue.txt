    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high size (loc = 257) combined with a relatively large number of fields (nof = 11) while exposing no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0). This indicates a large, concentrated implementation that has not been decomposed into smaller responsibilities. Other metrics (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dependencies present) do not contradict that the class itself is large and likely a candidate for further decomposition."
