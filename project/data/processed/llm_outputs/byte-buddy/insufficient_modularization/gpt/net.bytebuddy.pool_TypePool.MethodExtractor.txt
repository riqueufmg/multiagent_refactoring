    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.MethodExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 172) and a high number of fields (nof = 19) while having zero declared methods (nom = 0), indicating a concentration of data/state and/or responsibilities that have not been decomposed. The absence of methods (wmc = 0, nom = 0) combined with many fields suggests the class is not modularized and could be split into smaller, focused units. Low coupling metrics (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) do not mitigate the internal size/field concentration problem. These elements together justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
