    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and not complex (LOC=33, WMC=0), defines no methods or fields (nom=0, nof=0), has no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion issues detectable in the provided data. Although there are several referenced types in dependencies, the class metrics show it does not contain enough size or internal complexity to warrant further decomposition."
