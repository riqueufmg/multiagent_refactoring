    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being monolithic: large source size (loc = 359) and a substantial number of fields (nof = 14) indicate significant internal implementation. It has many external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities and cross-cutting concerns. Method-level metrics are zero (nom = 0, wmc = 0) despite the high LOC, which implies a large, insufficiently decomposed implementation rather than well-modularized methods. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
