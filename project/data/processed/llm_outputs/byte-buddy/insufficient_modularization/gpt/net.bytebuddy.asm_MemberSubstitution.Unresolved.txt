    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Unresolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has low size and complexity (loc=19, wmc=0), no methods or fields reported (nof=0, nom=0), zero coupling in metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no inheritance depth (dit=0). These indicators show the class is small and not complex, so there is no evidence it requires further decomposition."
