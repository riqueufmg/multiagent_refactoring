    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=23, WMC=0, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=0, number of public methods/fields (nopf/nopm)=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and LCOM is not indicating cohesion issues (-1.0 typically for empty classes). Given the lack of methods/fields, low complexity, and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence of an under-decomposed (insufficiently modular) class."
