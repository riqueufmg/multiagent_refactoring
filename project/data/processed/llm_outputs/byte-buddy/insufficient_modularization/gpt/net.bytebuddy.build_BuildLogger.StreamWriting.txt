    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a decomposable, high-responsibility unit: although LOC = 114, the class has nom = 0 (no methods), nof = 1 (one field), wmc = 0 (no cyclomatic complexity), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no coupling), and LCOM = -1.0 (no cohesion concerns reported). Given the lack of methods, complexity, and coupling in isolation, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
