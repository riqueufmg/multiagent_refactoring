    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=41, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=1, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, DIT=1. There is no evidence of high size or complexity that would justify further decomposition; coupling is minimal and there are no methods to split. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
