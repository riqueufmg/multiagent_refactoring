    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc = 12), no fields (nof = 0), no public fields (nopf = 0), no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given the lack of internal members and low complexity, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
