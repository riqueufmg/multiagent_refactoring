    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC = 19, no methods (nom = 0), no fields (nof = 0, nopf = 0), and very low complexity (WMC = 0). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only a shallow inheritance depth (DIT = 1). The single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) does not indicate internal aggregation of responsibilities. LCOM is not informative here (-1.0). These metrics provide no evidence of a large or complex class that requires further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
