    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=34, NOF=2, NOM=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). There is no evidence of large size or high implementation complexity that would justify further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
