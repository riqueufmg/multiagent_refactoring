    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.SelfContained",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Analyzed in isolation, the class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (loc=31), no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), zero weighted method count (wmc=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no cohesion/complexity indicators requiring decomposition (lcom=-1.0 indicates not applicable). These metrics indicate the class does not contain excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
