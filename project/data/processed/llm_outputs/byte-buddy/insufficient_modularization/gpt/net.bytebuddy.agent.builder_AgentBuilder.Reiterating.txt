    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Reiterating",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class appears insufficiently modular: it has a large size (loc = 189) while exposing no operations (nom = 0) and no measured method complexity (wmc = 0). It contains a moderate number of fields (nof = 8) but no methods to encapsulate behavior, and coupling metrics are zero (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), indicating implementation likely concentrated inside the class (initializers, inner types or large monolithic blocks). These elements (high LOC combined with nom = 0 and lack of modular structure) justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
