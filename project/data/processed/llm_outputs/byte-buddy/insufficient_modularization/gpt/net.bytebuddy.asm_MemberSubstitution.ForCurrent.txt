    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is relatively large (loc = 95) while declaring multiple fields (nof = 6) but no methods (nom = 0), indicating implementation is not decomposed into smaller methods. It also depends on many external types (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation), which suggests multiple responsibilities or mixed concerns that could be split into smaller, more focused classes or helper components to reduce size and complexity."
