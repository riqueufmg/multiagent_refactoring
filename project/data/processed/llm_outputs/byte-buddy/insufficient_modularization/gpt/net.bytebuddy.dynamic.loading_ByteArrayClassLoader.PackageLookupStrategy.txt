    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC is moderate (78), number of methods is 0 (nom=0) and number of fields is minimal (nof=1), cyclomatic/complexity is zero (wmc=0), coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one listed dependency. These elements provide no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
