    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.SelfInjection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely case of Insufficient Modularization because it is large (loc = 264) while showing no method decomposition (nom = 0, nopm = 0), indicating behavior is not split into smaller methods. It holds multiple fields (nof = 8) and depends on a variety of external types (net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator), which suggests multiple responsibilities concentrated in one class. The combination of high LOC, non-zero fields, zero methods, and multiple dependencies supports recommending further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
