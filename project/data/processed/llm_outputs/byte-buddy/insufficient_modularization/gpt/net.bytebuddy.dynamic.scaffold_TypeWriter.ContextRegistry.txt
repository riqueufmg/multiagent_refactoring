    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=23, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has no significant dependencies or complexity. These metrics indicate the class does not demonstrate the large size or high implementation complexity that would suggest insufficient modularization."
