    "justification": "Class size is very large (loc = 445) while it reports no methods (nom = 0) and low measured complexity (wmc = 0). The high LOC with few/zero methods indicates the class has not been decomposed into smaller, method- or class-level units and likely contains multiple responsibilities or large blocks of code. These metrics (loc = 445, nom = 0, wmc = 0) justify detection of Insufficient Modularization."
