    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large and likely holds multiple responsibilities: LOC = 2449 (extremely high for a single class) and NOF = 70 fields (many attributes). It has relatively few methods (NOM = 11) so those methods are likely very large, which indicates insufficient decomposition. The dependency list shows ~12 nested/inner types (Factory, Connection, Dispatcher, various platform-specific libraries/providers), indicating multiple distinct responsibilities bundled together that could be extracted. WMC = 11 is low relative to the huge LOC, suggesting large methods rather than many small, focused ones. Public fields (NOPF = 15) further suggest broad surface area and mixing of concerns. Fan-in/Fan-out = 0 implies low external coupling but does not mitigate the internal size/complexity. Taken together, these elements justify that the class has Insufficient Modularization and should be decomposed into smaller, focused classes."
