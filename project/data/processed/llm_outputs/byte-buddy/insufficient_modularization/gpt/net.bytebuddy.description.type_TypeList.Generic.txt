    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 669) and maintains many fields (nof = 25), which is a strong indicator it encapsulates multiple responsibilities and internal concerns that could be split. It also depends on numerous distinct types (ByteCodeElement, TypeList, FilterableList, TypeDescription, TypeVariableSource, TypeDefinition, TypeVariableToken, CachedReturnPlugin), suggesting it aggregates functionality across several areas. The shallow inheritance (dit = 1) offers little delegation of responsibility to superclasses. Taken in isolation, these metrics point to insufficient modularization — the class should be decomposed to reduce size, clarify responsibilities, and lower complexity."
