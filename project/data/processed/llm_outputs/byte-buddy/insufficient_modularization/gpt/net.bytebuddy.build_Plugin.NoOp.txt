    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=28, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, no fields (NOF=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). With no methods or measurable complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; metrics do not indicate a need for additional modularization."
