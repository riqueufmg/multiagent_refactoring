    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class: very small size (loc=23), only 1 field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few external dependencies. These elements indicate the class is small and simple, not a candidate for further decomposition."
