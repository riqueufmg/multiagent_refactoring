    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.NonAnnotatedTypeVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc = 40), minimal state (nof = 1), no behavior to decompose (nom = 0, nopm = 0, wmc = 0), and low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, only 2 listed dependencies). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and not a large, complex unit that requires further decomposition."
