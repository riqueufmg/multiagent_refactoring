    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.Target",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=48, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=4 (only a few fields). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no internal complexity or many responsibilities that would indicate a need for further decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization when the class is considered in isolation."
