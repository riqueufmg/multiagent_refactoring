    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AnnotationRemoval.AnnotationRemovingClassVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is large (loc = 106) while declaring many fields (nof = 7) but exposing no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0). The combination of high LOC and multiple fields with zero method-level decomposition suggests responsibilities are concentrated and not split into smaller units. Its dependencies on multiple external types (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader) indicate it interacts with diverse concerns, reinforcing that further decomposition into focused classes or components would likely reduce size and complexity."
