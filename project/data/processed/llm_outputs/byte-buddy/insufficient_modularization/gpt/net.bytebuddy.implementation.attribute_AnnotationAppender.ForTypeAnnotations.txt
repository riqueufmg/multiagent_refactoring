    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender.ForTypeAnnotations",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is large (loc = 250) while having a high number of fields (nof = 12, nopf = 2) yet no declared methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0), which suggests data/behavior are not cleanly separated or the class has not been decomposed into smaller behavior-bearing units. It also depends on multiple distinct types (AnnotationValueFilter, AnnotationAppender, TypeList, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription), indicating it touches several concerns. The combination of high LOC, many fields, lack of methods, and multiple external dependencies supports the detection of Insufficient Modularization."
