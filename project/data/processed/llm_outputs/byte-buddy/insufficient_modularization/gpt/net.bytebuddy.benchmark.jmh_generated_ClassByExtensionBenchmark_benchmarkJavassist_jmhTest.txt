    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_benchmarkJavassist_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: an extremely large number of fields (nof = 263) combined with a small number of methods (nom = 9) indicates a large aggregated state that is not decomposed into smaller, focused types. The implementation size (loc = 276) and relatively high cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc = 42) show substantial code surface and complexity that could be reduced by splitting responsibilities. Additionally, dit = 0 and fanin/fanout = 0 imply the class is self-contained, so its size is not mitigated by inheritance or external modularization. These elements together justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
