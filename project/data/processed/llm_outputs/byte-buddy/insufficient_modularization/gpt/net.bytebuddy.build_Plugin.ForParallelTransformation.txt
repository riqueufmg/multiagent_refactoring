    "justification": "High size and state: loc=209 and nof=12 indicate a large class with many fields. Behaviour imbalance: nom=0 (no methods) combined with the large LOC suggests the class contains substantial implementation that is not decomposed into smaller methods/units. Cohesion/analysis signals: LCOM=-1.0 (cohesion metric unavailable/problematic) and wmc=0 provide no evidence of well-decomposed responsibilities. Isolation: fanin=0 and fanout=0 with only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) imply complexity is internal rather than due to external coupling. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
