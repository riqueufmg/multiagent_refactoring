    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Considering the class in isolation, there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization: the class size is moderate (loc=80), it has a small number of fields (nof=4) and no methods reported (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating low internal complexity and responsibility concentration. Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, only three declared dependencies), and the cohesion metric is not signalling fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). These metrics suggest the class is not overly large or multi-responsibility and therefore does not exhibit the insufficient modularization smell."
