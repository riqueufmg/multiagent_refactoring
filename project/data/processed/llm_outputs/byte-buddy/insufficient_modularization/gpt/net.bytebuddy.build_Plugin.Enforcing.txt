    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed implementation: nom=0 and wmc=0 show no methods or implementation complexity to decompose; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate no coupling that would suggest a large cohesive responsibility; lcom=-1.0 (no method-based cohesion data) and loc=78 alone are insufficient to conclude Insufficient Modularization. In isolation, there is no evidence of a large, complex class that would benefit from further decomposition."
