    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithRetainedEnterType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and contains no members or measurable complexity: LOC=22, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=0, NOPM=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. LCOM is not indicative (-1.0) and there is only one external dependency. Given the lack of methods, fields, and complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; it is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization."
