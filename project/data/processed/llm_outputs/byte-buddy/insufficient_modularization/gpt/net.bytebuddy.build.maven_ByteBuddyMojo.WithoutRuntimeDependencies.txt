    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.WithoutRuntimeDependencies",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small size (loc = 13), no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0, nopf = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), no fields (nof = 0, nc = 0), and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not exhibit the size or complexity typical of Insufficient Modularization."
