    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.ForAndroidPVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: LOC=55 (small size), WMC=0 and NOM=0 (no methods / no complexity to decompose), NOF=2 (only two fields), NOPM=0, fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling indicating hidden responsibilities). LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion warning). Given the small size, absence of methods and low complexity/coupling, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
