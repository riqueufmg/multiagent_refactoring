    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 198 (large implementation size) while NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods / no measured method complexity), and NOF = 10 (many fields). This combination indicates a large, monolithic implementation concentrated in data/inline code rather than decomposed behavior. LCOM = -1.0 (non‑positive cohesion indicator) and low dependency/fan metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0, only two listed dependencies) further suggest the class is not delegating responsibilities and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, more modular units."
