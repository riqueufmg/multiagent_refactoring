    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being too large or complex: LOC = 51 (small), WMC = 0 and NOM = 0 (no method complexity or many responsibilities), NOF = 3 (few fields). Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate poor cohesion in the provided data. Based on these metrics taken in isolation, there is insufficient evidence to identify Insufficient Modularization."
