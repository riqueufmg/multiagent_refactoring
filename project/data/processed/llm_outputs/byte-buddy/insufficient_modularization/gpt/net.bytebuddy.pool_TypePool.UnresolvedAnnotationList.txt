    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.UnresolvedAnnotationList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small size and trivial structure: loc=25, nom=0, wmc=0, no fields/methods complexity (nof=1, nopf=0). Low coupling and usage: fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList. Given the minimal lines, zero methods/complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or that it should be further decomposed."
