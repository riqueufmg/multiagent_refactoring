    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=16, NOM=2 and WMC=2 indicate low size and low implementation complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests no cohesion issues, and fanin=0/fanout=0 show no complex dependency surface. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
