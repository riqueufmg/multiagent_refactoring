        "Class is very small (LOC=28) with only one field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0), so there is no sizable implementation to decompose.",
        "Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is zero (WMC=0) and there are no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating low internal complexity and coupling.",
        "No evidence of cohesion or size-related problems (LCOM=-1.0, likely not applicable given no methods), so further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
