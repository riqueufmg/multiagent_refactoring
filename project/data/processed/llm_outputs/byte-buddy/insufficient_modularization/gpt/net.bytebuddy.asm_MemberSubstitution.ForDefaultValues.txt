    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class: zero methods (nom=0) and zero weighted method count (wmc=0) show little or no behavior to split; only 4 fields (nof=4) and moderate size (loc=74) without complexity. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and LCOM is not showing cohesion problems (lcom=-1.0). The limited dependencies (4 listed) further do not suggest multiple responsibilities. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
