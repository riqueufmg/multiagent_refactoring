    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed, high-complexity class: LOC = 84 (moderate size), NOF = 6 (fields only), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods / no behavioral complexity), DIT = 1 (shallow hierarchy), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling evidence), LCOM = -1.0 (no cohesion warning in provided metric). Although there are several dependencies, the absence of methods and the low complexity metrics indicate this class is not a large, responsibility-heavy unit that would benefit from further decomposition."
