    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Inlining",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 895) and many fields (nof = 41) indicating multiple responsibilities that could be split, a large surface of external collaborations (dependencies include Implementation, MethodDescription, Assigner, AsmClassReader, TypeDescription, AnnotationDescription, OpenedClassReader, StackManipulation, StackSize, etc.), and metrics suggesting poor internal decomposition (extremely high LOC combined with zero reported methods/complexity values in the supplied metrics and an unhelpful cohesion indicator lcom = -1.0). Taken in isolation, these factors justify that the class is not sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
