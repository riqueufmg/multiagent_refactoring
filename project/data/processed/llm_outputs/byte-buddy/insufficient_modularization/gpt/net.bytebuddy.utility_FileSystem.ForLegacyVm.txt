    "justification": "Metrics show a small, low-complexity class: LOC=46, WMC=0, number of methods/fields = 0, fanin=0, fanout=0, DIT=1. Low size, no measurable method complexity or coupling, and only a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) provide no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
