    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WriterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=36), very low structural complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0), only two fields (nof=2), and no incoming/outgoing coupling measured (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
