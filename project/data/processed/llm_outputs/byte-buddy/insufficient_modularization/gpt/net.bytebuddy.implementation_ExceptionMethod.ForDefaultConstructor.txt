    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=27, WMC=0, number of methods=0 (nom=0), number of fields is small (nof=2). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and depth of inheritance is 0 (dit=0). Given the lack of methods/behavior and low complexity and size, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
