    "justification": "Class is very small and simple (LOC=13) with no methods (NOM=0), no fields (NOF=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), and no coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics show no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition when considered in isolation."
