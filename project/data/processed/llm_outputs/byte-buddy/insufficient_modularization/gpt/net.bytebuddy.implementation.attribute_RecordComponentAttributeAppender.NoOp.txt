    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=18, NOM=0, WMC=0, no fields (NOF=0), FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. DIT=1 and LCOM=-1.0 show no complexity or cohesion problems within the class. There is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would justify declaring Insufficient Modularization."
