    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high size (loc = 256) but very few methods (nom = 2) and low reported cyclomatic complexity (wmc = 2), indicating very large method bodies or bundled responsibilities instead of more, smaller methods. It declares multiple fields (nof = 4) and depends on many external types (listed dependencies), suggesting it coordinates several concerns that could be split. The combination of large LOC with low method count and many dependencies supports refactoring into smaller, more focused classes or extracting methods to improve modularization."
