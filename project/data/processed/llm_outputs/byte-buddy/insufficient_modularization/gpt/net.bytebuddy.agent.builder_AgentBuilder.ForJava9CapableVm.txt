    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForJava9CapableVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=33, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=1, weighted method count (wmc)=0. Low coupling and interaction: fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
