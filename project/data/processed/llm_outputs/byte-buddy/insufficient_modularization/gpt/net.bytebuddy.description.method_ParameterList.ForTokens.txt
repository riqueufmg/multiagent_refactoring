    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=38, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=2. Coupling and interaction are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies count=2). There are no methods to further decompose (nom=0) and overall size/complexity metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
