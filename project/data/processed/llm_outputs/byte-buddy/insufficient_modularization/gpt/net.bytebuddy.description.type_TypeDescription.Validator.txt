    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Validator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 229) combined with multiple fields (nof = 6) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and no package methods (nopm = 0) suggests internal complexity or multiple responsibilities not split into smaller classes. The cohesion metric is unavailable/ambiguous (lcom = -1.0) and complexity metrics are zero (wmc = 0), which together with the high LOC indicates the class body likely contains substantial, non-modular implementation that should be decomposed. Dependencies are limited but do not mitigate the internal size and field count, supporting the need for further decomposition."
