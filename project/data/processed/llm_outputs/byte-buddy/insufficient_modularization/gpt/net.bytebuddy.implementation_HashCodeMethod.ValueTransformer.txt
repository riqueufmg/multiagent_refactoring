    "justification": "High size (loc = 236) indicates a large implementation that is a candidate for decomposition; zero reported methods/fields (nof, nopf, nom = 0) combined with large LOC suggests many responsibilities are implemented without clear modular separation; low inheritance depth (dit = 1) provides no structural decomposition aid; cohesion metric is nonstandard/negative (lcom = -1.0), indicating poor/unclear cohesion; fanin and fanout are 0, implying the class is self-contained and likely monolithic. These elements together justify identifying Insufficient Modularization."
