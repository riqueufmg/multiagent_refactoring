    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is extremely large and likely doing too much: LOC = 6861 and NOF = 386 indicate a very large implementation surface that can be further decomposed. It also depends on a wide set of 26 distinct external types (many description/reader/utility classes), implying multiple responsibilities and high coupling. Given the massive size and number of members in isolation, this meets the criteria for Insufficient Modularization — the class should be split into smaller, cohesive components."
