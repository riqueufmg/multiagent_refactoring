    "justification": "No evidence of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=12), no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex and does not require further decomposition."
