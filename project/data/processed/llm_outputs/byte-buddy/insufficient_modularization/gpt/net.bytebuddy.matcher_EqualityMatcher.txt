    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.EqualityMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, WMC=3, NOM=3, LCOM=0.0, only 1 field. No inheritance depth (DIT=0), no nested complexity (NC=0), and no coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and well modularized, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
