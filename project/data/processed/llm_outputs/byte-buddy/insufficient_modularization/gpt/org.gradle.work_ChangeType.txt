    "justification": "Class is very small and non-complex: loc=7, nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0, wmc=0. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metric not applicable/insufficient data. Given the minimal size, lack of methods and low complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
