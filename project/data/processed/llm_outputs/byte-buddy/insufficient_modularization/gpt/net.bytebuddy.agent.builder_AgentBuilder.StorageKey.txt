    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is small (LOC=43), has minimal state (number of fields=1), no behavior to decompose (number of methods=0, number of public methods=0, WMC=0), and shows no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies). These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so further decomposition is not justified."
