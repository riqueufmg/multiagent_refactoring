    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high number of fields (nof=14, nopf=13) combined with substantial size (loc=105) while exposing no behavior (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0). Low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) imply decomposition would not create heavy cross-class dependencies. These elements suggest the class bundles many responsibilities/state and could be decomposed into smaller classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
