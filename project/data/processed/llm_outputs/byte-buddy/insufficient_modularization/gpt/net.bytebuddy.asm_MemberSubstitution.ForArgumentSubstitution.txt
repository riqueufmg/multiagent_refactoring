    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForArgumentSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a non-trivial size (loc = 109) and a relatively large internal state (nof = 8) while reporting no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0), indicating state/behavior are not cleanly decomposed into smaller collaborating units. It also references many external types (8 dependencies: net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue), which suggests multiple responsibilities. These elements (LOC=109, NOF=8, NOM=0/WMC=0, and multiple dependencies) justify refactoring into smaller, more focused classes or components."
