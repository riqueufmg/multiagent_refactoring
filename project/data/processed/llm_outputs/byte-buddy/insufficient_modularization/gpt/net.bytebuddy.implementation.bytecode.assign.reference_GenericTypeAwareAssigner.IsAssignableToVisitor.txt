    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner.IsAssignableToVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modularized because it has a very large size (loc = 336) while showing no methods counted (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and several fields (nof = 5). The large LOC indicates substantial implementation contained in a single class unit; the presence of multiple fields implies internal state/responsibilities, and the absence of recorded methods suggests that the implementation is not cleanly decomposed into smaller operations or collaborating classes. These metrics (high LOC combined with nontrivial field count and no method decomposition) justify flagging Insufficient Modularization. Dependencies: [net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin]."
