    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.JavaConstantValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc 68), has a single field (nof 1), only two methods (nom 2, nopm 2) and low cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc 2). Cohesion is high (lcom 0.0) and there is no inheritance depth (dit 0). Coupling indicators are low (fanin 0, fanout 0). Given these metrics, the class is already compact and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
