    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=57, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods to decompose). It has a small number of fields (NOF=4) and shows no coupling to or from other code (fanin=0, fanout=0). No indicators of high implementation complexity or multiple responsibilities that suggest further decomposition. The only listed dependency is an annotation/plugin (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), which does not imply insufficient modularization."
