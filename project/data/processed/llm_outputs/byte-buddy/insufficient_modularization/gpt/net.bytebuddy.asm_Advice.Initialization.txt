    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a lack of modularization: LOC is small (49), no fields (nof=0) and no methods (nom=0), cyclomatic/weight metric is 0 (wmc=0), and coupling is nil (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is not applicable (-1.0). There is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would require further decomposition."
