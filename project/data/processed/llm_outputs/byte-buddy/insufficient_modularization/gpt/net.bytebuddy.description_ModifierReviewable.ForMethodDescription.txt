    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=45), no methods (NOM=0) and no fields (NOF=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), zero fanin/fanout (fanin=0, fanout=0), no dependencies, and LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issues reported). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex and provides no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
