    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.DispatcherAnnotationPlugin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has small size and complexity: loc=44, nom=6, nopm=6 and wmc=7 indicate limited implementation surface and moderate cyclomatic complexity. Depth of inheritance is low (dit=1) and lack of children (nc=0) suggests no need to split due to subclassing. Coupling/usage metrics do not indicate broad responsibilities (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion measure (lcom=-1.0) does not imply fragmented responsibilities. Given these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
