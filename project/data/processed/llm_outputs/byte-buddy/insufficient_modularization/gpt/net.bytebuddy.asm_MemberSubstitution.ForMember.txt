    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=40, WMC=0, NOM=0 and NOF=3 indicate very few responsibilities and low implementation complexity. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric is not signalling fragmentation (LCOM=-1.0). Dependency list is limited. Given the low size, zero method complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
