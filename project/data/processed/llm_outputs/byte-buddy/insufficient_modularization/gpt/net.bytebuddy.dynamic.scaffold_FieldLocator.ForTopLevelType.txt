    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.ForTopLevelType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc = 28), no fields (nof = 0), no methods (nom = 0), very low complexity (wmc = 0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and no external dependencies beyond its own type. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and shows no signs of needing further decomposition."
