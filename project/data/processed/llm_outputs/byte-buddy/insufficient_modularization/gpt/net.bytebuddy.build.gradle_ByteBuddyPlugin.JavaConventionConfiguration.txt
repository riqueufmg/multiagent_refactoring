    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyPlugin.JavaConventionConfiguration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (LOC = 146) combined with a high number of fields (NOF = 12) while exposing no methods (NOM = 0, NOPM = 0). This suggests the class is accumulating many responsibilities/state without decomposition. Additional indicators: WMC = 0 and LCOM = -1.0 are not showing internal behavior cohesion, and fanin/fanout = 0 imply limited interaction surface that could be split into smaller focused types. Based on these metrics in isolation, the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
