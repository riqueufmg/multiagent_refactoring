    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.ForConstantValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: modest size (loc=65), no methods (nom=0) and zero WMC (wmc=0) indicate little behavioral complexity to decompose; only 2 fields (nof=2); low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and limited dependencies. These metrics suggest a small, focused/cohesive unit rather than a large class that requires further decomposition."
