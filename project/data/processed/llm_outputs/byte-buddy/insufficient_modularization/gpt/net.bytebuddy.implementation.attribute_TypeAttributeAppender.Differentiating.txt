    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=51, NOF=3 fields, NOM=0 methods, WMC=0, DIT=1. Low fan-in (0) and fan-out (0) indicate minimal coupling. There is no evidence of high complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
