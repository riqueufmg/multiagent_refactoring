    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Linked",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 69 (modest size), WMC = 0 and NOM = 0 (no internal method complexity), NOF = 3 (few fields), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling indicating distributed responsibilities). Given the low complexity and coupling and absence of many methods, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
