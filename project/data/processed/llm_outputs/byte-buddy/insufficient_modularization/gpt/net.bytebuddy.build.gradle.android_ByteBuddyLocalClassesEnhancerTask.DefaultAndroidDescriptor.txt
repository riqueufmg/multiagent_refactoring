    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask.DefaultAndroidDescriptor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC 47), no methods (nom 0) and zero measured complexity (WMC 0), only one field (NOF 1), low coupling (fanin 0, fanout 0), single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator), shallow inheritance (DIT 1) and high cohesion (LCOM -1.0). These metrics indicate the class is minimal/simple and does not need further decomposition."
