    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.BootstrapArgumentResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows a notable size (loc: 70) while exposing no methods (nom: 0, wmc: 0) and only two fields (nof: 2). This imbalance — relatively high LOC with zero decomposed operations — indicates logic is not organized into methods/units and could be further decomposed. Additional evidence: lcom is not meaningful here and fanin/fanout are 0, suggesting internal complexity is concentrated inside the class rather than distributed; the presence of multiple dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant) further implies multiple responsibilities. Together these elements justify reporting Insufficient Modularization."
