    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: loc=28 (small size), nom=0 (no methods), nof=1 (single field), wmc=0 (no complexity), dit=0 (no inheritance depth), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling evidence), lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion problem reported). These elements show the class is small, simple, and low-complexity, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
