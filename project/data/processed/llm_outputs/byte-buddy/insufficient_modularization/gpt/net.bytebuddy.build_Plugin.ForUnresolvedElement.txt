    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: loc=29, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0, nof=2 (likely only fields), nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. The absence of methods and dependencies and the very low size/complexity imply it is a simple data/marker holder rather than a large, undecomposed unit. Therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
