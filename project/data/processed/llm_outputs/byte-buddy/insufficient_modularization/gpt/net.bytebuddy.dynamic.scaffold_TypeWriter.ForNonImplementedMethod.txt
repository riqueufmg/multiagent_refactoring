    "justification": "No evidence of Insufficient Modularization: small-to-moderate size (loc=68), no methods (nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0) indicate the class is not large or complex; cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 and zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) show no modularity or cohesion problems in isolation; dependency list is limited (5 entries) and does not imply a monolithic implementation. Therefore further decomposition is not indicated by the provided metrics."
