    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, non-complex class: loc=26, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=1. Low coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0) and a single dependency (AnnotationDescription) indicate little internal responsibility to decompose. LCOM=-1.0 does not suggest cohesion problems in the provided data. Given the minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
