    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=25, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, DIT=1, FANOUT=0, no dependencies. There are no methods or fields to decompose and cyclomatic/size measures are minimal, so there is no evidence of a large undivided responsibility that would justify 'Insufficient Modularization'."
