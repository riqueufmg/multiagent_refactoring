    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LCOM=0.75 (low cohesion) indicates the class' methods are not tightly related; LOC=77 and WMC=6 show moderate size/complexity concentrated in only NOM=4 methods (NOPM=3); NOF=3 fields imply multiple state elements being managed. The combination of low cohesion with non-trivial size/complexity suggests the class has multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed further, i.e. insufficient modularization."
