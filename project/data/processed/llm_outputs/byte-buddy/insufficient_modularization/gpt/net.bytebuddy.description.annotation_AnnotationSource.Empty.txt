    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationSource.Empty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=13, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPF=0, NOPM=0. Low coupling and usage: fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList. Inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1) and LCOM indicates no method-level cohesion concerns. Given the very small size and lack of methods/complexity, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
