    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.MultipleParentClassLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modular: it has high size (loc = 325) but a small number of methods (nom = 8, nopm = 5), indicating very large methods and concentrated implementation. WMC = 14 shows non-trivial internal complexity combined inside the class. It also carries multiple fields (nof = 6), suggesting several pieces of state/concerns held in one type. DIT = 1 and fanin/fanout = 0 indicate behavior is not being distributed via inheritance or many collaborations, so responsibilities are concentrated in this class. Although LCOM = 0.375 indicates reasonable cohesion, the large LOC per method and overall class size justify decomposing this class into smaller, more focused modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
