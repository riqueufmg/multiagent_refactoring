    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit evidence of insufficient modularization: loc is modest (97), number of methods is 0 (nom = 0) and weighted methods complexity is 0 (wmc = 0), indicating little internal behavioral complexity to decompose. It has only 3 fields (nof = 3), no apparent coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and LCOM is not indicating low cohesion (lcom = -1.0). Given the lack of methods/complexity and small size in isolation, further decomposition is not warranted."
