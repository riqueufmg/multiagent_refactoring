    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithDrain",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has substantial size (loc = 101) while showing no methods (nom = 0) and no measured complexity (wmc = 0). It has a small number of fields (nof = 3) and several external dependencies (3), but zero fan-in/fan-out, indicating functionality is concentrated inside the class rather than decomposed. The combination of large LOC with zero methods suggests the class has not been decomposed and is a candidate for modularization."
