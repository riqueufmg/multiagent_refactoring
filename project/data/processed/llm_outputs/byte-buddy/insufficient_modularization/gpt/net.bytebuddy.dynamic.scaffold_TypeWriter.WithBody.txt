    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithBody",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: moderate size (loc=92) with only 4 fields, no methods (nom=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0). Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no evidence of high internal complexity or large method implementations to split. Given these values, there is no justification to mark this class as suffering from Insufficient Modularization."
