    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that requires further decomposition: LOC is 71 but NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods/complexity), NOF = 2 (only two fields), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (low coupling). Dependency list contains a single build/plugin reference. Given the absence of methods and low coupling/complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
