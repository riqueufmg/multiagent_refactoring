    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class. LOC is 86 which is moderate, but there are 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is -1.0 (no cohesion data). Given the absence of method/field complexity and no external coupling in the provided data, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity for this class when considered in isolation."
