    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class is small (LOC=65) with no recorded method complexity (WMC=0) and no methods reported (NOM=0), a modest number of fields (NOF=4), shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) does not suggest scattered responsibilities. Given the low size, low complexity and low coupling in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
