    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC is small (77), number of fields is low (nof=4), number of methods is zero (nom=0), weighted methods complexity is zero (wmc=0), cohesion metric not indicating fragmentation (lcom=-1.0 not showing high lack of cohesion), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the class in isolation, there is no evidence of excessive size, high complexity, or high coupling that would justify further decomposition."
