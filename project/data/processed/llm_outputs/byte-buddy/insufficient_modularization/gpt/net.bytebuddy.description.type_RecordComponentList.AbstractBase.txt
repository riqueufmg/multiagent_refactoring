    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: loc=39 (small size), nom=0 and nof=0 (no methods/fields to decompose), wmc=0 (no internal complexity), fanout=0 and fanin=0 (no coupling pressure to split), dit=2 (shallow inheritance only). LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metric not applicable here. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
