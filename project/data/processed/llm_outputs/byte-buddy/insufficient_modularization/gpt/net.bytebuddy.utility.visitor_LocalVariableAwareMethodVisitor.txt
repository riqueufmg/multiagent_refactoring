    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=34, number of methods (nom)=3, WMC=8 (moderate overall complexity across few methods), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). Low coupling/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow hierarchy (DIT=0) indicate no obvious responsibilities to split. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
