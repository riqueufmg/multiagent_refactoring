    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=33), no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Only a single build-time dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) is listed. In isolation these metrics indicate low responsibility and low complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
