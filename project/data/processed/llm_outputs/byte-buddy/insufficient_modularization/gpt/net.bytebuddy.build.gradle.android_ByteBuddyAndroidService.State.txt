    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC=101 (moderate size) with no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0). Cohesion/complexity indicators are low (lcom=-1.0, nc=0), coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are few. Number of fields (nof=7) is not large enough by itself to justify further decomposition. Therefore there is no clear evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
