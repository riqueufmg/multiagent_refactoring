    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.AccessibilityMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: 26 LOC, 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=2) and low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=3). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is zero (dit=0). These metrics indicate the class is already well modularized and does not require further decomposition."
