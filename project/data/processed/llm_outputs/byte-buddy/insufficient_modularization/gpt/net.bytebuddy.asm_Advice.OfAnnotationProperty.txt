    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OfAnnotationProperty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit evidence of Insufficient Modularization: it's small (LOC=57), has very low structural complexity (WMC=0, NOM=0), only two fields (NOF=2), no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics the class is already simple and does not show the size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
