    "justification": "Analyzed in isolation: the class is small (loc=24), has no methods or fields reported (nom=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependency list is minimal (1). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not show signs that it has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
