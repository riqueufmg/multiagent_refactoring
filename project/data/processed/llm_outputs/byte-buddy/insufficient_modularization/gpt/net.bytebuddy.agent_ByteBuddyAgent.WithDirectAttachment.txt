    "justification": "Class considered in isolation shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=24), no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
