    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=39), no methods (nom=0), low complexity (wmc=0), few fields (nof=3), no coupling or dependencies recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) and lack of methods indicate there is nothing to further decompose in isolation."
