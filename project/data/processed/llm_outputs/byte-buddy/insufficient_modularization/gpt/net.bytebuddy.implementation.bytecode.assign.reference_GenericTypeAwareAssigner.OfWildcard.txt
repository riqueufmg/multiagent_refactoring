    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner.OfWildcard",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has low size and complexity (LOC=72, WMC=0), no methods reported (NOM=0) and no fields requiring decomposition (NOF=1, NOPF=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few external types are referenced. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
