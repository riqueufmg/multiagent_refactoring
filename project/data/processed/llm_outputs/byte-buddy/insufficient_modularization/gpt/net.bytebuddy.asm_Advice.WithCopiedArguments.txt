    "justification": "Class examined in isolation shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc = 27), no fields or methods reported (nof = 0, nom = 0), zero cyclomatic/work metric (wmc = 0), and no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Dependency list is minimal (only net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal/simple and does not require further decomposition."
