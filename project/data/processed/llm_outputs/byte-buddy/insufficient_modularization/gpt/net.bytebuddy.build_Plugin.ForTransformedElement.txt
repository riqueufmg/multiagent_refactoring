    "justification": "Not detected: the class is very small and not complex—LOC=34, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, number of fields (nof)=2. Coupling and dependencies are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, 2 external dependencies listed). With no methods to factor out and low complexity/size, there is no indication that further decomposition is required."
