    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: an extremely high number of fields (nof = 263) combined with a relatively large size (loc = 275) and elevated complexity (wmc = 42). Although method count is modest (nom = 9, nopm = 8) and LCOM = 0.0 does not indicate poor cohesion, the disproportionate amount of state (263 fields) and overall complexity suggest the class encapsulates too much responsibility and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes or components."
