    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.FailSafeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=37, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOF=2, LCOM=0.0. There is no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no coupling indicated by fan-in=0 and fan-out=0. These values show low size and low complexity with good cohesion, so there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition (no indicators of excessive responsibilities or complexity)."
