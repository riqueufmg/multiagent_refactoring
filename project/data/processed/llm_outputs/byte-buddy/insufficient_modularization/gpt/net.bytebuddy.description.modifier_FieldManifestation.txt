    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization. The class is small (LOC=63) with a modest method count (nom=7, nopm=6) and low cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=7). It has a single field (nof=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and acceptable cohesion (lcom=0.4285714285714285). These metrics indicate the class is not excessively large or complex and does not require further decomposition."
