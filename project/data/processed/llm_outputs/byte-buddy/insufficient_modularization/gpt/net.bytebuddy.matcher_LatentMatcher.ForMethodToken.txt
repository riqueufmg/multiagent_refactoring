    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=44), no methods to decompose (NOM=0, NOPM=0), low complexity (WMC=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1), low coupling (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0). Cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) does not signal a need for further decomposition. Given these values the class is small and simple in isolation and does not show evidence that it should be further decomposed."
