    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForEnumerationValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no indicators of being under-decomposed: LOC is small (49), there are no methods (nom = 0) and no measured complexity (WMC = 0). Field count is low (nof = 3) and coupling metrics show no incoming or outgoing usage (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given these metrics and the limited dependency set, there is no evidence that the class requires further modularization."
