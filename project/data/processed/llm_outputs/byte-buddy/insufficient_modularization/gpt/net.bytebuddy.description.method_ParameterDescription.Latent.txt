    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: although LOC=126 and number of fields (nof=7) show some size, there are no methods recorded (nom=0) and cyclomatic complexity is zero (wmc=0), suggesting no concentrated implementation complexity to decompose. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric is not signaling a problem (lcom=-1.0). Given the lack of methods/complexity, there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization."
