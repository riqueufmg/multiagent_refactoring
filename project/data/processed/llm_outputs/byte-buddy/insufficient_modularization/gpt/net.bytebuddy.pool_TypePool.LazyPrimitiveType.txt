    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular. Metrics: loc=58 (small size), nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods to decompose), wmc=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), nof=4 (only four fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling evidence), lcom=-1.0 (no indication of low cohesion). Given the small size, zero method complexity, and lack of coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
