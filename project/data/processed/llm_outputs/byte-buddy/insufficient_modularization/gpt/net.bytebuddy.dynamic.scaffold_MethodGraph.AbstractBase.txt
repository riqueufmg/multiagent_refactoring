    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class contains no behavior to decompose: nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no complexity), loc=23 (small size). Coupling and dependencies are absent (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]), and inheritance depth is minimal (dit=0). LCOM=-1.0 is not indicating cohesion issues here. Given the lack of methods/fields and minimal size/complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
