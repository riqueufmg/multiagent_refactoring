    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=29, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). There is no evidence of high size, high complexity, or multiple responsibilities that would justify further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
