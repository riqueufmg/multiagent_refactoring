    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 138) while decomposition metrics are absent/zero (nof = 0, nom = 0, nopm = 0, nopf = 0), indicating the class body is substantial but shows no reported internal modular structure (no methods/fields reported). The cohesion metric is undefined/invalid (lcom = -1.0), preventing evidence of good cohesion. Given the sizable LOC combined with lack of internal decomposition and undefined cohesion, this is indicative of Insufficient Modularization."
