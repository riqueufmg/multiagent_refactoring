    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.RedefinitionClassVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is very large (loc = 552) and holds many fields (nof = 23), which indicates that it carries substantial state and multiple responsibilities. Its dependency set spans several distinct concerns (implementation, type initialization, method and type descriptions, class reading, class file versioning, modifier handling, method rebase resolution), suggesting it mixes responsibilities that could be split. Although some metrics (nom, wmc) are reported as zero and LCOM is -1.0 (indicating measurement limits), the combination of high LOC, high field count, and wide-ranging dependencies justifies decomposing this class into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and implementation complexity."
