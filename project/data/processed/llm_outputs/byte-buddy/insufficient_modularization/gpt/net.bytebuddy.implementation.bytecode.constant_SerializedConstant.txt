    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC = 55, number of methods = 3, number of fields = 2. Complexity is low (WMC = 4) and cohesion is high (LCOM = 0.0). Coupling indicators show no external callers or heavy references in the provided data (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and inheritance depth is nil (DIT = 0). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and simple, so there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
