    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size with loc=179 while reporting nom=0 and nopm=0 indicates a large implementation body without decomposition into methods; nof=2 but fanin=0 and fanout=0 show the class contains internal state and behavior rather than delegating; lcom=-1.0 (low/undefined cohesion) and wmc=0 (no measured complexity breakdown) together suggest the class groups multiple responsibilities. These metrics collectively indicate the class is not sufficiently modularized and would benefit from decomposition."
