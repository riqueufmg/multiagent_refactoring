    "justification": "Insufficient modularization not detected: although LOC=102 (moderate size), other indicators do not show a decomposable, high-responsibility class. WMC=0 and nof/nom/nopf/nopm=0 show no measured internal complexity or large numbers of members; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate low coupling; dependencies are limited to four type/description classes. LCOM is undefined/negative (-1.0), preventing a cohesion-based conclusion. Considering the class in isolation, there is insufficient evidence to claim it requires further decomposition."
