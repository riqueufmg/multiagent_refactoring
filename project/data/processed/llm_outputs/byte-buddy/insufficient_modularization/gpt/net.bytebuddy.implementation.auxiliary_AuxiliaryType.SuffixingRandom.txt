    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType.SuffixingRandom",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=27, number of fields=2, number of methods=0 (nom=0), WMC=0, fanout=0. These metrics indicate low size and negligible implementation complexity; there is no evidence of a large, monolithic implementation that would benefit from further decomposition. External dependencies are limited (2), so coupling does not suggest missed modularization opportunities. Analyzing the class in isolation, the data does not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
