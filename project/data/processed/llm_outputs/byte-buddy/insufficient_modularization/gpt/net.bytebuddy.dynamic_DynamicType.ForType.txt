    "justification": "Metrics show the class is tiny and non-complex: LOC=11, number of fields (nof)=0, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0. Fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate no coupling that would mask hidden responsibilities. LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable here) and other counts are zero. There is no evidence of a large, complex class that would benefit from further decomposition."
