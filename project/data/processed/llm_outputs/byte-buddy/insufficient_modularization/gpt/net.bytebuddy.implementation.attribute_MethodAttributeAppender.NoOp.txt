    "justification": "Class is small and trivial: LOC=18, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=0, NOPF=0, NOPM=0. Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0) and DIT=1. LCOM=-1 indicates no meaningful cohesion data (no methods/fields). Given the lack of methods, fields, complexity, and dependencies, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
