    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC = 63, WMC = 0, NOM = 0. Cohesion is high (LCOM = -1.0) and it has a modest number of fields (NOF = 4). Inheritance depth is minimal (DIT = 1) and there is no measured coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given the lack of methods to split, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
