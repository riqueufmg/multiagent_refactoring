    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: 0 methods (nom=0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0) show no large method body count or high internal complexity; only one field (nof=1); low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LOC=53 alone is not sufficient evidence of an undecomposed class given the absence of methods and complexity. Dependencies listed do not imply internal size or responsibility spread in isolation."
