    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=21, no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), WMC=0 and NC=0, fanin=0 and fanout=0. These metrics indicate low size and complexity and do not suggest a need for further decomposition. Dependencies are minimal (StackManipulation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription), providing no evidence of an overly large or complex single-class implementation."
