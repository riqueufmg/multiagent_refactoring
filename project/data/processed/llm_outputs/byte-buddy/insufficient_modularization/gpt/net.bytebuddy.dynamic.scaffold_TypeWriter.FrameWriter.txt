    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: nom=0 (no methods), nof=2 (only two fields), wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, and no dependencies. Although LOC=96, the absence of methods and zero complexity/coupling measures (and LCOM=-1.0 indicating no applicable cohesion data) provide no evidence that the class contains multiple responsibilities or high implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
