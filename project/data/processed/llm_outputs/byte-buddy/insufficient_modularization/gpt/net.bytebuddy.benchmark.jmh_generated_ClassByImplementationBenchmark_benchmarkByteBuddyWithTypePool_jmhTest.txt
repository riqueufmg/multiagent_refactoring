    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High number of fields (nof = 263) and relatively large size (loc = 276) indicate the class holds a large amount of state and/or responsibilities that could be split. Complexity metrics (wmc = 42) are elevated for a single class with a modest number of methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8), suggesting concentrated complexity. Additionally, there are no subclasses (nc = 0, dit = 0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling recorded (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), implying the class is self-contained rather than decomposed across other types. These factors together point to insufficient modularization."
