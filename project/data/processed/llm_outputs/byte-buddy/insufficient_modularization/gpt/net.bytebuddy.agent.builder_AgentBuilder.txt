    "justification": "The class is extremely large and appears to aggregate many responsibilities: 9519 LOC, 44 methods (nom) and a WMC of 44 indicate substantial size/complexity. The metric nof = 293 (very high) and the dependency list contains a very large number (≈50+) of AgentBuilder.* inner/related types (e.g. AgentBuilder.Disabled, ForLegacyVm, CreationAction, Listener, InitializationStrategy, ExecutingTransformer, Transformation, RedefinitionStrategy, ResubmissionStrategy, LambdaMetafactoryFactory, Dispatcher, Factory, Handler, InstallationListener, etc.). The proliferation of specialized strategies, transformers, listeners, schedulers and many nested types within the same class boundary shows multiple orthogonal responsibilities that could be split into smaller, focused classes/modules to reduce size and implementation complexity. Based on these elements, Insufficient Modularization is present."
