    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ExecutingTransformer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits indicators of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 484) and a high number of fields (nof = 32) which suggest multiple responsibilities or a large internal data/state surface. It also depends on many external types (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeValidation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType), indicating a wide functional footprint. Although some computed metrics (nom = 0, wmc = 0, lcom = -1.0) appear missing or anomalous, the substantial LOC and large field count alone justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would likely benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
