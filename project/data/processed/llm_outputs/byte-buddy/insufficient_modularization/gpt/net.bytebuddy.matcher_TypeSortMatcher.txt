    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOF=1 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size and low internal complexity. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is zero (DIT=0). Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
