    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=52), no methods (nom=0) and thus no internal complexity (wmc=0), single field (nof=1), zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (dit=1). LCOM value (-1.0) does not show cohesion problems here. Dependency list is minimal. These elements do not justify further decomposition of the class in isolation."
