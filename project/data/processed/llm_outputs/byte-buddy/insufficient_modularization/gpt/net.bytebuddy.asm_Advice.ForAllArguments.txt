    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForAllArguments",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 145) and defines a relatively large number of fields (nof = 9) while showing no method decomposition (nom = 0, wmc = 0). It also depends on a broad set of external types (10 different dependencies listed), indicating multiple responsibilities or interactions bundled in one unit. These indicators (high LOC, many fields, many dependencies, and absence of method-level decomposition) support that the class has not been sufficiently modularized and could be split to reduce size and implementation complexity."
