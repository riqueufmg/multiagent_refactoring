    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows a large size (loc = 174) while having no recorded methods (nom = 0) and no measured complexity (wmc = 0), which indicates the implementation is not decomposed into smaller methods. It also has very few fields (nof = 3) and no external dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), suggesting a self-contained but monolithic implementation. The cohesion metric is unreported/invalid (lcom = -1.0), supporting the possibility of unclear or mixed responsibilities. These elements together justify detection of Insufficient Modularization."
