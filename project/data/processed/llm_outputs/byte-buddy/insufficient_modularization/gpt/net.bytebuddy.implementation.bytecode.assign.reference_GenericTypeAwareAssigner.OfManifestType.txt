    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner.OfManifestType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC = 49, WMC = 0, number of fields = 2, number of methods = 0. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and it has only 2 external dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already compact and not overly complex, so there is no evidence it requires further decomposition."
