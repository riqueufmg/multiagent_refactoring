    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Cancelable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: low size (loc=43), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), a single field (nof=1), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one external dependency. These metrics indicate the class is small and simple and does not require further decomposition."
