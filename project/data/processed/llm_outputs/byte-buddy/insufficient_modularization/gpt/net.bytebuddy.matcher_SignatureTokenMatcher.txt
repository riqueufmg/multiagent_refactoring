    "justification": "The class is small and simple: 26 LOC, 3 methods (nom=3) and low complexity (WMC=3). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). With a single field (nof=1) and no signs of large size or high implementation complexity, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
