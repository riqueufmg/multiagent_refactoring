    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: it contains 0 methods (nom=0) and low size (loc=34) with only 2 fields (nof=2), so there is nothing within the class body that can be further decomposed. Complexity metrics are minimal (wmc=0), coupling is absent (fanout=0, fanin=0), and there are no dependencies. LCOM is -1.0 (no measurable cohesion due to lack of methods), reinforcing that there is no internal implementation to split. Therefore, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
