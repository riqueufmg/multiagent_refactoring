    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: LOC=36 (small), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods/complexity), NOF=1 (single field), NC=0, DIT=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0, and no dependencies. With no methods or internal complexity to decompose, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
