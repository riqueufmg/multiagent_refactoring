    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=79, number of fields=2, number of methods and WMC=0 indicate minimal implementation size and complexity. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited. There is no evidence from the provided metrics of high complexity, large size, or poor cohesion that would warrant further decomposition."
