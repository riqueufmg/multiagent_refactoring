    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, high-complexity class: modest size (loc=82), small number of fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity weight (wmc=0). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these values, there is no evidence this class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition; it appears to be a simple data-holder/inner class rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
