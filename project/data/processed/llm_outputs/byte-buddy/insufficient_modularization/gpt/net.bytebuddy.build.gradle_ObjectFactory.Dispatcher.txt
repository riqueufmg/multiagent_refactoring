    "justification": "Metrics show 0 methods (nom=0), very low complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2). LOC is 71 but with no methods and no coupling this does not indicate an undecomposed, complex implementation. LCOM is not signaling cohesion problems (lcom=-1.0). Based on these elements in isolation, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
