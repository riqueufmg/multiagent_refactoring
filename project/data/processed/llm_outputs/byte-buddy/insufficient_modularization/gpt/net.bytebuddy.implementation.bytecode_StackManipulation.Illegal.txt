    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, simple class: LOC=19, NOM=0, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0, DIT=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). There are no methods or measurable complexity to decompose further, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
