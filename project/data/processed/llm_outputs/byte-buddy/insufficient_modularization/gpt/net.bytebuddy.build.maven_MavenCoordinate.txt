    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.MavenCoordinate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=61), low method count (nom=5, nopm=4), modest complexity (wmc=7), small number of fields (nof=4), and very high cohesion (lcom=0.0). No fan-in/fan-out or dependency data suggests unmanageable coupling. Taken in isolation, these values imply the class is reasonably sized and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
