    "justification": "No: metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, large, or complex class. LOC=53, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0 and LCOM=-1.0 — the class has no methods, minimal size, zero measured complexity and no coupling/dependencies, so there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
