    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.InjectionClassLoader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no strong signs of insufficient modularization: modest size (loc=107) with a small number of methods (nom=7, nopm=4) and low-to-moderate complexity (wmc=8). Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.2857142857) and the class holds minimal state (nof=1, nopf=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no inheritance complexity (dit=0). These metrics indicate the class is reasonably cohesive and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not indicated based on the provided data."
