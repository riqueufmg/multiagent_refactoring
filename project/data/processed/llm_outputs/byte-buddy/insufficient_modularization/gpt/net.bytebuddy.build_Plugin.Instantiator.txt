    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Instantiator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows a large physical size (loc = 170) while having a small number of fields (nof = 7) and no methods (nom = 0). This combination suggests a monolithic implementation that has not been decomposed into smaller responsibilities. Supporting metrics (wmc = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0) do not indicate modular decomposition or clear, distributed complexity. Given the high LOC relative to the low counts of fields and methods, the class likely suffers from Insufficient Modularization and could be refactored into smaller units."
