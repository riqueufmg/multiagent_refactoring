    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForDynamicInvocation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is moderately large (loc = 107) while holding a high number of fields (nof = 10) but reporting no methods (nom = 0) and no method-level complexity (wmc = 0). This combination (many fields, substantial LOC, and few/no methods) indicates a data-/responsibility-heavy class that has not been further decomposed. The presence of multiple external dependencies (JavaConstant, TypeList, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, ElementMatcher, StackManipulation, etc.) further suggests it is coordinating multiple concerns. Taken in isolation, these elements point to insufficient modularization and that the class could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
