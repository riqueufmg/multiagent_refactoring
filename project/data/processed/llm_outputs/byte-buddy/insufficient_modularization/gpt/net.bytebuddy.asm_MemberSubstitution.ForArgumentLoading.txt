    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a decomposable, complex class: nom (number of methods) = 0 and wmc (weighted methods per class) = 0 show no method-level complexity to split; nof (fields) = 2 indicates minimal state; loc = 102 is moderate but not accompanied by methods or complexity, suggesting no large behavioral surface to decompose; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 indicate low coupling. Given the absence of methods and low coupling/complexity, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
