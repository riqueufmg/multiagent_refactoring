    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.RawAnnotatedType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a non-trivial size (loc = 146) and a relatively large number of fields (nof = 7) while declaring no methods (nom = 0). This combination (loc=146, nof=7, nom=0, wmc=0, lcom=-1.0) indicates a substantial data/implementation surface concentrated in a single class that has not been further decomposed; decomposing responsibilities or extracting components could reduce size and implementation complexity."
