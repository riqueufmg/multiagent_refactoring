    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.RecordComponentAttributeAppender.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=31, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0. It has minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two listed external dependencies. Shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and LCOM=-1.0 indicate cohesion. These metrics show the class is already compact and does not exhibit signs that it needs further decomposition."
