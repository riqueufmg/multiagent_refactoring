    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: LOC=17, WMC=0, no methods reported (nom=0), fan-in=0, fan-out=0. There is no evidence of high cohesion or complexity problems that would be reduced by further decomposition. Although the class lists several external dependencies, in isolation its size and complexity do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
