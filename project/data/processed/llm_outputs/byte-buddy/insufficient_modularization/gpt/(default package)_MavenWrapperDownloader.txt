    "justification": "LOC=93 and WMC=12 indicate moderate size and complexity; NOM=6 with NOPM=1 (only one public method) implies many internal/helper methods, suggesting multiple responsibilities hidden inside the class; LCOM=0.8333 (high, near 1) shows low cohesion among methods/fields. These elements (size, internal complexity, low cohesion, few public entry points) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from decomposition (extraction of responsibilities into separate classes or helper objects)."
