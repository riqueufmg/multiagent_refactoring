    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no responsibility to decompose: LOC=12, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPF=0, WMC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable), fan-in=0, fan-out=0, dependencies=[]. Given the zero method/field counts, zero complexity and lack of dependencies, there is no evidence of an under-decomposed class that would benefit from further modularization."
