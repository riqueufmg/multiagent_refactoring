    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Ambiguous",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 179) while declaring no methods (nom = 0) and six fields (nof = 6). A high line count combined with zero reported methods suggests substantial implementation (e.g. long initializers, large constructor, or inlined logic) that has not been decomposed into smaller methods or helper classes. The presence of multiple fields with no method decomposition indicates multiple responsibilities and low modularization. These elements (loc = 179, nom = 0, nof = 6) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
