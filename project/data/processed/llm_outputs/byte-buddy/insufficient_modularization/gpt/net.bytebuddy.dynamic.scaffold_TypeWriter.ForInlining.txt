    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForInlining",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 1331) and a high number of fields (nof = 52) indicate it likely encapsulates many responsibilities and implementation details that could be split. It also depends on a wide set of unrelated components (e.g. net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodRebaseResolver, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator), suggesting multiple roles and concerns. Taken in isolation, these factors justify that the class should be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
