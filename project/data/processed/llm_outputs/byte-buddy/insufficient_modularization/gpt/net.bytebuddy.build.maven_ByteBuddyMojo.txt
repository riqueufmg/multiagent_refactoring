    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size and complexity: LOC=971 and WMC=38 indicate a very large and complex class. Large state: NOF=37 (many fields) with NOPF=25 suggests substantial internal data. Few top-level methods: NOM=5 (NOPM=1) meaning complex behavior is concentrated in few large methods. Multiple embedded responsibilities: presence of several nested/dependent inner types (ByteBuddyMojo.Transformer, .StalenessFilter, .Coordinate, .ForDiscoveredPlugin, .TransformationLogger) implies the class contains multiple roles that could be split out. Together these metrics (very large LOC, many fields, high complexity, few methods, and multiple inner classes) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from further decomposition."
