    "justification": "Metrics indicate no sign of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=46), very low complexity (wmc=0), no methods reported (nom=0), only one field (nof=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate lack of cohesion. Given the class's small size, minimal complexity and low coupling, there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
