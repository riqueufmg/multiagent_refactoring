    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=44, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), low complexity (wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependency list is short (3 types). Inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1) and cohesion metric indicates no fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). These factors do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large or complex class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
