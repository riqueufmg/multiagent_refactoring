    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=13, WMC=0, NOM=0, no fields/methods reported, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is minimal and does not show the size or complexity symptoms that would warrant further decomposition. LCOM is non-indicative here (−1.0) but with zero methods there is no evidence of low cohesion or multiple responsibilities."
