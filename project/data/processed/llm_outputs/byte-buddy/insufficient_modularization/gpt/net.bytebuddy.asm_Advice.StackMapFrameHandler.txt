    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Evidence for Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 941) indicating a monolithic implementation; substantial state (nof = 17) suggesting multiple responsibilities; abnormal/low cohesion indicator (lcom = -1.0) implying poor cohesion among members; touches multiple concerns (dependencies include TypeDescription, ClassFileVersion, MethodDescription, AsmVisitorWrapper) which suggests mixed responsibilities; fanin/fanout = 0 combined with the above points to concentrated internal complexity rather than decomposition. These elements indicate the class should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
