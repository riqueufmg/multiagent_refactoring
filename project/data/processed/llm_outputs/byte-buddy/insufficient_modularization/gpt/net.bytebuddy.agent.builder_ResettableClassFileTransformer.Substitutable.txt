    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer.Substitutable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC is 136 but the class has 0 methods (nom=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3), WMC=0 and LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion problems reported). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, showing no measurable coupling that would suggest splitting responsibilities. Given the absence of methods/complex logic and low coupling/complexity metrics, there is no evidence in the provided data that the class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
