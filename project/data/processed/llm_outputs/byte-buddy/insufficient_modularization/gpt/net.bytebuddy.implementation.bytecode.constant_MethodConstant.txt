    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.MethodConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and relatively complex: LOC = 388 and WMC = 20 indicate substantial size and cyclomatic complexity for a single class. It declares many fields and behaviors (NOF = 12, NOM = 11 with 5 public methods), which suggests multiple responsibilities that could be separated. The class contains nested types (MethodConstant.CanCache and MethodConstant.CanCacheIllegal) which implies internal decomposition that may be better represented as separate classes. Although LCOM = 0.1818 shows acceptable cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high WMC, numerous fields/methods, and embedded inner classes justifies that the class has not been fully decomposed and is a candidate for further modularization."
