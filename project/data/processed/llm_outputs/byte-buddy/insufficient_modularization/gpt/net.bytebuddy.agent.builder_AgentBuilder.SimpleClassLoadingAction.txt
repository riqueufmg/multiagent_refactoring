    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition: loc=28 (small), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods/low complexity), nof=2 (only two fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), dit=0 and nc=0 (no inheritance/children). Given these values, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
