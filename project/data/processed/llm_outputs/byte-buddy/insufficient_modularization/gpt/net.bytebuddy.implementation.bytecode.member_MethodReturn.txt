    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate this class is a candidate for further decomposition: moderate size (loc=79) with a small number of methods (nom=4, nopm=3) but relatively high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=9). Lack of cohesion is high (lcom=0.75), suggesting methods are not tightly related and the class may hold multiple responsibilities. It has few fields (nof=2) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), which lowers the risk of splitting. Given these factors (loc, wmc, lcom, nof, fanin/fanout) decomposition could reduce complexity and improve cohesion."
