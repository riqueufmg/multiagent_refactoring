    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 313), high method count (NOM = 18, with NOPM = 17 public methods) and elevated complexity (WMC = 25). The combination of many public methods and substantial cyclomatic complexity indicates multiple responsibilities and implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposing the class into smaller, focused classes or helpers. Although field count is modest (NOF = 6) and cohesion metric is low (LCOM = 0.0), the overall size and method/complexity metrics justify refactoring to improve modularization."
