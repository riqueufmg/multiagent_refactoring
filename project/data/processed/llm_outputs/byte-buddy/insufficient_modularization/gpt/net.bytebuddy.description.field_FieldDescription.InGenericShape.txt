    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: loc=9, nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no complexity). Low coupling and dependencies: fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Low inheritance depth dit=1. Given the minimal size, lack of members, and negligible complexity/coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition (Insufficient Modularization = false)."
