    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.UsingJump",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC is small (67), number of methods is 0 (nom=0) and weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) indicating no internal behavioral complexity to decompose; number of fields is minimal (nof=2); coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependency list is small (4 dependencies). The cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not indicate fragmentation that would require further decomposition. Based on these metrics taken in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
