    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not overly complex: LOC=63, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency: net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion). LCOM is not indicating a cohesion problem (LCOM=-1.0 in provided data). Given the low size, zero method complexity, and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
