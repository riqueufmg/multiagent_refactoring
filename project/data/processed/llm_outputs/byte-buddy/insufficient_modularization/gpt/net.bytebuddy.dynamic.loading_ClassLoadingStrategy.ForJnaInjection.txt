    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of needing further decomposition: small size (LOC=28), very low complexity (WMC=0), no methods reported (NOM=0, NOPM=0), a single field (NOF=1), low inheritance depth (DIT=1) and high cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies are listed. These metrics indicate the class is small, simple, and not a candidate for additional modularization."
