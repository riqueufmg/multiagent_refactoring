    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForTypeValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and simple (loc=32, nof=2), has no methods reported (nom=0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (dit=0) and minimal dependencies. These metrics indicate it is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
