    "justification": "No evidence of insufficient modularization: size is small (loc=53), there are no methods or method complexity reported (nom=0, wmc=0), coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few external dependencies are listed. LCOM is not meaningful here (lcom=-1.0). Given the class-level metrics in isolation, the data do not indicate a large, complex, or tightly coupled class that would benefit from further decomposition."
