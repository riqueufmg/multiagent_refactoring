    "justification": "Considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization: the class is small (loc=37), has no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted complexity (wmc=0), and shows no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods to decompose, there is no indication that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
