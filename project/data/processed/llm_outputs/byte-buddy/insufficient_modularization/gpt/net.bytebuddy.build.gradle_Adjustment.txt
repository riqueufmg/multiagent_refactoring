    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: size is relatively large (LOC = 177) while containing multiple members (NOF = 3 fields, NOM = 6 methods). Cohesion is poor (LCOM = 1.0), indicating methods likely address different responsibilities and could be split into separate classes/modules. Although cyclomatic/weight measure is moderate (WMC = 6), the combination of high LOC and maximal LCOM, together with no inheritance or inner-class decomposition (DIT = 0, NC = 0), supports that further decomposition would reduce class size and complexity. Fan-in/fan-out = 0 does not negate the internal lack of cohesion."
