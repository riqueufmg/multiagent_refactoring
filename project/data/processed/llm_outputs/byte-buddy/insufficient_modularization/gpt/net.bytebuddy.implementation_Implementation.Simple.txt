    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Simple",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a large size (loc = 152) while declaring 6 fields (nof = 6) but 0 reported methods (nom = 0), which suggests substantial implementation content not decomposed into smaller methods or collaborating classes (likely long initializers or many inner/anonymous constructs). It also depends on a variety of distinct concerns (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation), indicating multiple responsibilities mixed in one class. These factors (high LOC, several fields, absence of explicit methods, and multiple external dependencies) justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
