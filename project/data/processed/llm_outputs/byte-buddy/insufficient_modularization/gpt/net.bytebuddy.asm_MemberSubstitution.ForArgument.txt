    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForArgument",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 169) and contains a relatively high number of fields (nof = 16), while depending on a wide range of distinct responsibilities (dependencies include ParameterDescription, JavaConstant, TypeList, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, MethodDescription, Assigner, TypeDescription, AnnotationDescription, StackManipulation). The combination of substantial size and many diverse external dependencies indicates the class likely aggregates multiple responsibilities and can be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
