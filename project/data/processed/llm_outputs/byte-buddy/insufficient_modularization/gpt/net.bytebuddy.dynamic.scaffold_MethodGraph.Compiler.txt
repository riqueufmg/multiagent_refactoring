    "justification": "Large implementation size (loc = 1174) combined with a high number of fields (nof = 33) indicates the class likely contains multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed. The class also references several external types (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility), suggesting it coordinates multiple concerns. These indicators (very high LOC and many fields plus broad dependencies) are characteristic of Insufficient Modularization."
