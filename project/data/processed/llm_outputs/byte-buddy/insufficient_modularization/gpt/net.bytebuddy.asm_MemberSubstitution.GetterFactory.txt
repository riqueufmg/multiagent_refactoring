    "justification": "The class shows no indicators of being insufficiently modular: small size (loc=42), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0) mean there is little implementation to decompose; only two fields (nof=2) exist and cohesion metric is not informative (lcom=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and listed dependencies are limited. These metrics do not justify further decomposition."
