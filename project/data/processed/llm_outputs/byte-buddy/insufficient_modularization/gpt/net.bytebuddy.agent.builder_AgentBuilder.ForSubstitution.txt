    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: loc=13, wmc=0, nom=0, nopm=0, nc=0, lcom=-1.0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one listed dependency (ResettableClassFileTransformer). Given the very low size, no methods to decompose, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
