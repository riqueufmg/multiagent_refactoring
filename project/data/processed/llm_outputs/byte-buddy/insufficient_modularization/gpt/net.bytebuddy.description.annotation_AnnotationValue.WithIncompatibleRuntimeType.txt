    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.WithIncompatibleRuntimeType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=34, nof=1 (one field), nom=0/no public methods, WMC=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), and only one dependency to AnnotationValue. These metrics indicate low size and complexity and do not suggest an undivided, overly large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition when analyzed in isolation."
