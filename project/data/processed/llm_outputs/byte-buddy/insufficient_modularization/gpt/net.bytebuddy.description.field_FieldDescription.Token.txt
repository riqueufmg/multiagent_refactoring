    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: nom (number of methods) = 0 and wmc (weighted method count) = 0 show no implementation complexity; nof (number of fields) = 4 is small; loc = 102 is moderate but not by itself evidence of excessive size; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show low coupling to other types; dependencies list is short. LCOM = -1.0 is not a clear sign of poor cohesion in this data. Overall there is no metric-based evidence of insufficient modularization."
