    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc=178) and many fields (nof=10) while reporting no methods (nom=0), which suggests a large data/responsibility bundle that could be decomposed. Its dependencies span multiple concerns (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility), indicating mixed responsibilities (graph structure, equality/hash handling, method description, visibility). The cohesion metric is indeterminate (lcom=-1.0), but the size and field count together justify considering further decomposition."
