    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=178) combined with a very small number of methods (nom=1) indicates a lot of implementation concentrated in a single unit rather than decomposed into smaller methods/classes. WMC=1 but high LOC suggests complexity is embodied as size rather than cyclomatic branching, harming maintainability. The presence of an inner/nested type reference (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy.Resolved) and multiple declared fields (nof=3) further implies the class is hosting multiple responsibilities. Based on these metrics (high LOC with only one method and supporting nested/dependent types), further decomposition is recommended."
