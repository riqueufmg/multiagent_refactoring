    "justification": "Class metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: small size (LOC=40), few methods (nom=3, nopm=2), low complexity (wmc=3), shallow inheritance (dit=1) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies only to StackManipulation and Implementation). Cohesion (lcom=0.6667) is moderate and does not, by itself, suggest an unresolved combination of responsibilities. These factors indicate the class is already sufficiently modular."
