    "justification": "Class has a small-to-moderate size (loc=66) with few methods (nom=5) and only one field (nof=1). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), indicating related responsibilities, and there are no nested types (nc=0) or inheritance depth (dit=0) that suggest overloaded responsibilities. Although the complexity metric (wmc=12) is non-trivial, the combination of low method count, high cohesion, and low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) does not support further decomposition in isolation."
