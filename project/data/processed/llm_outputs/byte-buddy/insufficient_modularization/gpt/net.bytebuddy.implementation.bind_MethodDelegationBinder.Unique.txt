    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Unique",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no symptoms of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=22), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only three listed dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and contains no internal complexity or responsibility concentration that would justify further decomposition."
