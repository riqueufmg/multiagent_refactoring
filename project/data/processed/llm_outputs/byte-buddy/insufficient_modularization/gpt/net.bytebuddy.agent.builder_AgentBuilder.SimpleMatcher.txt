    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.SimpleMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only 36 LOC, 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods (nom=0) with zero complexity (wmc=0). There is no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single dependency. LCOM=-1 indicates no cohesion concerns given the absence of methods. These metrics show the class is small and simple and provides no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
