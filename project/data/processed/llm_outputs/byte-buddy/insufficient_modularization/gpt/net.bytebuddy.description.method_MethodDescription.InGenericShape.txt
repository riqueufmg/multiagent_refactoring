    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=13, WMC=0, no fields (nof=0) and no methods (nom=0). Low coupling: fanin=0, fanout=0 and only two simple dependencies. Depth of inheritance (DIT=2) and LCOM=-1.0 do not indicate a need for further decomposition. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
