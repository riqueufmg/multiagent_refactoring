    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.ConstructorResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: nom=1, loc=32, wmc=1, nof=0. It has no inheritance depth (dit=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external type dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed."
