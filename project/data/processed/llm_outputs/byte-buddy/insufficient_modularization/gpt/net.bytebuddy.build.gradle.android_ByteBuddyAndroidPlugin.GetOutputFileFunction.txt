    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=13, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0. No incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no measurable cohesion because there are no methods to decompose. Given the minimal size and zero complexity/interaction metrics, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
