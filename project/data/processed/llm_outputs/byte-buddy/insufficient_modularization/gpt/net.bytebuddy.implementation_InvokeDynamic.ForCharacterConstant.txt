    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForCharacterConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC = 28, number of fields (nof) = 1, number of methods (nom) = 0, WMC = 0. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only three external dependencies are listed. These metrics indicate the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would motivate further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
