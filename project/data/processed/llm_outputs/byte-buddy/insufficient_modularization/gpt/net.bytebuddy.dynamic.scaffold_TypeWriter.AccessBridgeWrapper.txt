    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size and broad responsibilities: 282 LOC and 10 fields indicate a large class body. It references a wide range of unrelated concerns (13 distinct external dependencies: AnnotationValue, Implementation, ByteCodeAppender, AnnotationValueFilter, ParameterDescription, ParameterList, AnnotationList, TypeList, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, MethodAttributeAppender, StackManipulation), suggesting the class bundles multiple responsibilities (access bridging, annotation handling, bytecode/appender logic, method/parameter/type description handling). These metrics and the multiplicity of dependencies support that the class is insufficiently modular and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, focused classes."
