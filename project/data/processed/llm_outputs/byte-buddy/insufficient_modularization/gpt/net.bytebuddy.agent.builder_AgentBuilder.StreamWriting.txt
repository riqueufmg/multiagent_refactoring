    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.StreamWriting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (LOC = 52), no methods (nom = 0) and only one field (nof = 1), zero weighted method complexity (WMC = 0), and no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Dependencies are minimal. These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
