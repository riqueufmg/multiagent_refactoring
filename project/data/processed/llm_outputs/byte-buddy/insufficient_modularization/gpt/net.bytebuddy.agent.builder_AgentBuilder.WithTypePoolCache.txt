    "justification": "LOC = 127 (substantially large for a single class/inner class) and NOF = 4 (multiple fields) with 4 external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). These indicators (high LOC combined with multiple fields and several distinct dependencies) suggest the class is bundling multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed to reduce size and coupling."
