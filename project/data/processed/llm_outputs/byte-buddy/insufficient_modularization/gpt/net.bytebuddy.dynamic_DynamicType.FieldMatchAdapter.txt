    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=39, number of fields (nof)=1, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method complexity (wmc)=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. No evidence of high implementation complexity or many responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization; dependencies alone do not imply internal size or cohesion problems."
