    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 22, number of methods (nom) = 0, number of fields (nof) = 0, WMC = 0, fan-in = 0, fan-out = 0, DIT = 0, no dependencies. LCOM = -1.0 indicates cohesion is not applicable due to absence of methods. Given the very small size and zero internal complexity/coupling, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
