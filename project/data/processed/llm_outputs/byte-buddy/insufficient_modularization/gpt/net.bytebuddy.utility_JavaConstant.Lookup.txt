    "justification": "The class is very small and shows no signs of being a conglomerate of responsibilities: loc=18, nof=0 (no fields), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), dit=0 (no inheritance depth), lcom=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0. Only one external dependency is listed (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Given the lack of methods, fields, internal complexity, and coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
