    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=33, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=2. Low coupling and usage: fanin=0, fanout=0. Shallow inheritance: DIT=1. Metrics show no methods or cyclomatic complexity to decompose further and no indications of high responsibility concentration, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
