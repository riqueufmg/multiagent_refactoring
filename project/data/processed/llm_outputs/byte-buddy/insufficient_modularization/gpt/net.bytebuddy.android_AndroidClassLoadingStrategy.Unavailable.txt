    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.Unavailable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: loc=28 (small size), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods and zero cyclomatic complexity), nof=1 (single field), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no incoming/outgoing dependencies). These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so further decomposition is not warranted when analyzing the class in isolation."
