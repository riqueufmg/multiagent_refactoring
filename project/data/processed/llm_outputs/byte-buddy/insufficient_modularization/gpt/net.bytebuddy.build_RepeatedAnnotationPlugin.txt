    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not excessively complex: 74 LOC, 4 methods (nom=4), 2 fields (nof=2) and WMC=6. LCOM=1.0 does not suggest widespread lack of cohesion for a class of this size. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, and there is no indication of a large number of responsibilities or high complexity that would warrant further decomposition. Based on these elements considered in isolation, there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
