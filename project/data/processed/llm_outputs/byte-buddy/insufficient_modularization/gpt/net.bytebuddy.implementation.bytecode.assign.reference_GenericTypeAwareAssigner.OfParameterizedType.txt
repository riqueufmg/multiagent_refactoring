    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner.OfParameterizedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and non-complex: LOC=19, WMC=0, NOF=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has a single listed dependency (TypeDescription). There are no methods or fields to decompose, so there is no evidence of a large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition."
