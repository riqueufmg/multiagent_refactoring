    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForStringRepresentation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class analyzed in isolation shows no evidence of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc = 13), no methods (nom = 0) and no fields (nof = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), and no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
