    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition: loc=11 (very small), nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods to split), wmc=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), nc=0 (no fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no significant coupling). Only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) is listed. Given the lack of size, methods, complexity, and coupling, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
