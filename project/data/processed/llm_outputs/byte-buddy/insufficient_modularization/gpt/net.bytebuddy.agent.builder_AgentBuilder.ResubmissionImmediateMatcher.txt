    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ResubmissionImmediateMatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 158) while reporting zero methods (nom = 0). It declares multiple fields (nof = 6) but exposes no methods, which suggests a monolithic implementation (large block of code, initializers, or embedded logic) that has not been decomposed into smaller units. The combination of high LOC and absence of methods is a strong indicator that further decomposition (splitting responsibilities into additional methods or helper classes) could reduce size and implementation complexity."
