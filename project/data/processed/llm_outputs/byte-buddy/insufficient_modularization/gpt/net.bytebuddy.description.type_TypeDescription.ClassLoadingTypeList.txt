    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a lack of decomposition: LOC=40 (small size), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods / no cyclomatic complexity), NOF=3 (few fields), Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 (no coupling evidence), DIT=0 (no inheritance depth). Only one dependency (TypeList). These values show low size and complexity, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
