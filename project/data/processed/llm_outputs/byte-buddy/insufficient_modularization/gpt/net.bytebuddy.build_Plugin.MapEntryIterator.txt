    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=35), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no listed dependencies. In isolation there is no evidence the class needs further decomposition."
