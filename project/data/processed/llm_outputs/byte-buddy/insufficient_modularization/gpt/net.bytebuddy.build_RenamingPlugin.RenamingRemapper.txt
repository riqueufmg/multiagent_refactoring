    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RenamingPlugin.RenamingRemapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and trivial: loc=30, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), nof=2 (only two fields), nc=0, dit=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issues due to absence of methods). Given the lack of methods, low size, zero complexity and negligible coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
