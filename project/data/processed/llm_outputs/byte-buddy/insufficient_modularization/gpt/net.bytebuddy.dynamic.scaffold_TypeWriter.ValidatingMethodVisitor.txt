    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ValidatingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 65 lines of code (loc=65) but reports 0 methods (nom=0) and only 1 field (nof=1), indicating substantial implementation without decomposition into methods. Cyclomatic/workload metrics are 0 (wmc=0) while cohesion is unspecified/abnormal (lcom=-1.0), and there are no incoming or outgoing interactions recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0). This combination — non‑trivial LOC with no methods and minimal fields/dependencies (only net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader) — suggests the class embodies behavior that has not been modularized and could be split into smaller methods or helper classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
