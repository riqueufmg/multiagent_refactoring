    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForInterface",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 122) while showing no method-level decomposition (nom = 0, wmc = 0). It defines only one field (nof = 1) and has no measured fan-in/fan-out, indicating behavior is not split into methods or collaborators within this class. These metrics (high LOC combined with zero methods and zero complexity measures) are consistent with Insufficient Modularization: the implementation appears concentrated in a single large unit that could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
