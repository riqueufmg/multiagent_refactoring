    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: modest size (loc=52), zero methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), only 5 fields, no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM does not show problematic cohesion. There is no evidence of high complexity or multiple responsibilities that would justify reporting Insufficient Modularization."
