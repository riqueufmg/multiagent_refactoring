    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc=506) while providing a moderate number of methods (nom=9) and fields (nof=7), indicating long methods or embedded responsibilities. The file declares multiple distinct nested types (ResettableClassFileTransformer.Factory, .Callback, .CreationAction, .ForLegacyVm, .WithDelegation, .WithCallback) which represent separate roles/behaviors that could be split into their own top-level classes. Although cyclomatic weight (wmc=9) is not extremely high, the combination of large size and multiple embedded collaborators indicates poor decomposition. The presence of many named inner types and related dependencies (Factory, CreationAction, ForLegacyVm, WithDelegation, WithCallback, Callback) justifies refactoring into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and improve modularity."
