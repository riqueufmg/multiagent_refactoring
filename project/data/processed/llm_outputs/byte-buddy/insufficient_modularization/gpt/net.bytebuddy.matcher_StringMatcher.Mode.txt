    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.StringMatcher.Mode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a substantial size (loc = 101) while showing no decomposition into methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0). It declares only one field (nof = 1) and has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), indicating a self-contained but bulky unit. The combination of relatively large LOC and absence of methods suggests the class has not been broken down into smaller, focused units and therefore exhibits Insufficient Modularization."
