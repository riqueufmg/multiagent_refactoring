    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: moderate size (LOC=50), no methods (NOM=0) and no cyclomatic complexity (WMC=0), small number of fields (NOF=2), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate low cohesion in this isolated view. Dependency list is small. Thus there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
