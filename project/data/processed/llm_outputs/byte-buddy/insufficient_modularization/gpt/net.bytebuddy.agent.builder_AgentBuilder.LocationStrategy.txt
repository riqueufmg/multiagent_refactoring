    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 153) while exposing no methods (nom = 0) and only two fields (nof = 2). A relatively high LOC with near-zero method count suggests the file contains substantial implementation that is not decomposed into smaller, cohesive methods or subcomponents. Additional indicators: cohesion metric unavailable/negative (lcom = -1.0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) despite the size, implying internal complexity rather than interaction. These elements together indicate insufficient modularization and that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
