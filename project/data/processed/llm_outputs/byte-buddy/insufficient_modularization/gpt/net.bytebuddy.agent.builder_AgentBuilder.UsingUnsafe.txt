    "justification": "No evidence of insufficient modularization: small size (loc = 57), no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), low cohesion indicator (lcom = -1.0 but no methods to decompose), no inheritance depth (dit = 0), and no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
