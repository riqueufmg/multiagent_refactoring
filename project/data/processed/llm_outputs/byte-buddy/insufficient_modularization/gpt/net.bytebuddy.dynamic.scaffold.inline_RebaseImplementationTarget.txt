    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. LOC = 170 (moderate), NOM = 6 and WMC = 6 (low method count and low complexity), LCOM = 0.0 (high cohesion). Field count = 6 is moderate but not excessive. DIT = 0 and no fanin/fanout reported. No signs of multiple responsibilities, high complexity, or large method count that would justify further decomposition."
