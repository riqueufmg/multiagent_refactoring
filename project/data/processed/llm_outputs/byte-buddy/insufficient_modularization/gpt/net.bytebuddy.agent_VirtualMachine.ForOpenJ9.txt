    "justification": "Large size and data concentration indicate insufficient modularization: LOC = 1121 (very large), NOF = 30 (many fields), NOM = 0 (no methods to encapsulate behavior), NOPF = 6 (several public fields). Combined with WMC = 0 and lack of method-level decomposition, these metrics point to a class that has not been decomposed and would benefit from splitting responsibilities into smaller classes or extracting cohesive methods."
