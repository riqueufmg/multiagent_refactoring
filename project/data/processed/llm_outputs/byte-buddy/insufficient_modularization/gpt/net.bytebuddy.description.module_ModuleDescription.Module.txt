    "justification": "The class is not detected as Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=35), reports no methods/fields (nom=0, nof=0), has no measured complexity (wmc=0), and shows minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only one dependency listed. These metrics provide no evidence of a large, monolithic implementation that would benefit from further decomposition."
