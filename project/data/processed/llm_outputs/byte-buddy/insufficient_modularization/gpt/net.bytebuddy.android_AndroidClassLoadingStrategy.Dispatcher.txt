    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: nom (number of methods) = 0 and wmc (weighted method count) = 0 show no behavioral implementation to decompose; nof (fields) = 4 is small; loc = 105 is moderate but without methods or complexity it does not imply a single large cohesive unit that needs splitting; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show no coupling that would motivate internal decomposition. The available metrics therefore do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
