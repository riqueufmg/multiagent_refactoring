    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_jmhType_B3",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very high number of fields (nof=256) while having no methods (nom=0) and low lines of code (loc=18), indicating a large data aggregate concentrated in a single class. WMC=0 (no method complexity) and nom=0 imply behavior is not separated into smaller collaborating units; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show it is isolated rather than modularized. The disproportion between nof and loc/nom supports that further decomposition (splitting fields/concerns into separate classes) would reduce size and improve modularity."
