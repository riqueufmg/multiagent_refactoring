    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForOwnerType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (loc=36), no methods (nom=0) and no method complexity (wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single listed dependency. LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem in the provided data. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
