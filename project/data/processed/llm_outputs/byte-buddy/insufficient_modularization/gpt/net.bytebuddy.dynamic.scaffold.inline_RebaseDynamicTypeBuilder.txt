    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=72, NOM=4 and WMC=4 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion, suggesting responsibilities are not scattered. There is only 1 field (NOF=1) and minimal public surface (NOPM=1), so no evidence of an incompletely decomposed class. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating limited coupling that would motivate decomposition. Although the class references many types, based on the provided isolated metrics there is no indication of insufficient modularization."
