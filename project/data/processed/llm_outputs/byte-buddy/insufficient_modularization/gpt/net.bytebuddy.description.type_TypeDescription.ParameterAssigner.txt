    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ParameterAssigner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 115 LOC, its internal complexity and responsibilities appear limited: no methods (nom=0), low weighted method count (wmc=0), only three fields (nof=3), zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a low cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0) with only two dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is not currently large or complex in behavior and does not show signs of multiple responsibilities that would require further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
