    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.OfFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (loc=22), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal state (nof=1), and zero complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies are listed (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). DIT=0 and LCOM=-1.0 do not indicate cohesion problems. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
