    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.FieldConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization when considered in isolation. Metrics indicate modest size and complexity: loc=88, nom=5, wmc=7 and only nof=2 fields. Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.4), and there are no incoming or outgoing coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the small method count, moderate complexity and reasonable cohesion, there is no strong evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
