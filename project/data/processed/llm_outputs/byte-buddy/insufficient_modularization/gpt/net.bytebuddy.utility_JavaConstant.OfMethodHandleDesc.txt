    "justification": "Metrics show no evidence of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=20), no methods reported (NOM=0), zero implementation complexity (WMC=0), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency), and no cohesion issue indicated (LCOM=-1.0). These elements indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
