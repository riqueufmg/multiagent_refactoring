    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size and many fields: loc=290 and nof=20 indicate the class is large and holds many fields, suggesting multiple responsibilities. Lack of decomposed behavior: nom=0 and wmc=0 (no/low reported methods/complexity) combined with high field count suggests an aggregation that could be split into smaller, more focused modules. Uncertain cohesion: lcom=-1.0 (invalid/unknown cohesion) prevents confirming good cohesion and supports refactoring risk. Multiple external ties: dependencies=[net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool] increase the likelihood that splitting responsibilities would reduce complexity and improve modularity."
