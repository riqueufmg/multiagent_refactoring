    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.NullValueGuard",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: it is large (loc = 134) for a single class/inner class, has multiple fields (nof = 4) and several external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, StackManipulation, StackSize) indicating multiple responsibilities. The metrics show zero declared methods (nom = 0) while containing substantial code size, suggesting behavior is concentrated rather than decomposed into smaller methods/classes. These factors together justify that the class likely could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
