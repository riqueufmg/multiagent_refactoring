    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: loc=84 (moderate size), nof=3 (few fields), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no internal complexity or many methods to split), dit=1 (shallow hierarchy), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling). Although the class depends on several external types, its internal size and complexity are low, so there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
