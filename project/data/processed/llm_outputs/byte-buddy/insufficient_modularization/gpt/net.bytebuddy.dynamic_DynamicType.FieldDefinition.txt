    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 223) while exposing very few structural elements (nof = 3 fields, nom = 0 methods). This imbalance (high LOC with no methods) suggests a concentration of code that could be split into smaller, focused units. The presence of multiple distinct dependencies (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AnnotationList, FieldAttributeAppender, Transformer) indicates interaction with several separate responsibilities, increasing the likelihood that the class is handling multiple concerns. Additionally, cohesion information is not informative (lcom = -1.0), and complexity metrics (wmc = 0) do not reflect the apparent size, supporting the conclusion that the class is insufficiently modularized and would likely benefit from decomposition to reduce size and separate responsibilities."
