    "justification": "High size and state: loc=275 and nof=19 indicate a large class with many fields. Lack of behavioral decomposition: nom=0 and wmc=0 show no measured methods/complexity, suggesting responsibilities are not encapsulated in smaller methods or helper classes. Cohesion/metric signal: lcom=-1.0 (anomalous/low cohesion indicator) supports the view that the class groups unrelated state/behavior. These elements together indicate insufficient modularization and a candidate for further decomposition."
