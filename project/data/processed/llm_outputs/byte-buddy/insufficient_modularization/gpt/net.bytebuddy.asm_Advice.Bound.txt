    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=17, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0. Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or cohesion problems (LCOM indicates no issue). Based on these metrics the class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
