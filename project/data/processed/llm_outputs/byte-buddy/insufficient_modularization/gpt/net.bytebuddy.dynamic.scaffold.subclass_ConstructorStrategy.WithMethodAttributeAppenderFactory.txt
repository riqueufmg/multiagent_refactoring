    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.ConstructorStrategy.WithMethodAttributeAppenderFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=34, no methods (nom=0), low complexity (WMC=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), shallow inheritance (DIT=1), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization and does not require further decomposition in isolation."
