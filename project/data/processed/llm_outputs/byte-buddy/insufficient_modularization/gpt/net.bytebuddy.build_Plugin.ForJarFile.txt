    "justification": "The class is small and has negligible internal complexity: LOC=37, WMC=0, NOF=1, NOM=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it declares no methods to decompose. Given the low size, lack of behavioral content, and minimal dependencies, there is no indication that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
