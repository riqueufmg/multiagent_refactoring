    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that is insufficiently modularized: number of fields = 1, number of methods = 0 (nom=0), WMC = 0, fan-in = 0, fan-out = 0, and only one dependency. LOC = 44 is modest but there is no behavioral complexity to decompose (no methods or measurable complexity). Given the lack of methods/behavior and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
