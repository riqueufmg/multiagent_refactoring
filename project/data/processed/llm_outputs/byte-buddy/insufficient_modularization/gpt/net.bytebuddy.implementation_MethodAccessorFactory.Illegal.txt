    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, simple class: LOC=25, no fields or methods (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0), zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0), no coupling in/out (fanin=0, fanout=0), and shallow inheritance (dit=1). There is no internal implementation complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
