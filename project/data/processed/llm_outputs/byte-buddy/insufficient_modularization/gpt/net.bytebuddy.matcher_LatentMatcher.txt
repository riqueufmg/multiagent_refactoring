    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows concentrated implementation size with 240 LOC but only 1 method (nom = 1, loc = 240), indicating a single routine likely carrying multiple responsibilities. It has a relatively large number of fields (nof = 9) supporting that lone method, which suggests state and behavior that could be split. The low method count combined with a single weighted-method complexity (wmc = 1) implies complexity is not distributed across multiple methods or helper classes. Additionally, the class references many domain types (MethodDescription, FieldDescription, TypeDescription, RecordComponentDescription, ElementMatcher, etc.) while remaining monolithic, which supports further decomposition. These elements together indicate Insufficient Modularization."
