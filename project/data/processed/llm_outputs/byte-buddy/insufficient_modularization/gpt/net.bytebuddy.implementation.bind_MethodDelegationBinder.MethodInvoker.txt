    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an unduly large or complex class that needs further decomposition: LOC = 46 (small), NOM = 0 and NOF = 1 (very few members), WMC = 0 (no complexity), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling), LCOM = -1.0 (not indicating low cohesion). Dependency list is minimal. These elements collectively argue against Insufficient Modularization."
