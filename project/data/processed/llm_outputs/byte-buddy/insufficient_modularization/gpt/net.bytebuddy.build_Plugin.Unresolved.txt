    "justification": "Class is very small and shows no internal complexity or responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition: LOC=12, NOF=0 (no fields), NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no cyclomatic complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one listed dependency. LCOM is not meaningful here (-1.0) but with no methods/fields there is no cohesion problem to resolve. Given these metrics, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
