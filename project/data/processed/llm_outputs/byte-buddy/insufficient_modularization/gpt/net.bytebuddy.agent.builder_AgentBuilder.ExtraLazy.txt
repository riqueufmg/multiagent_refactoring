    "justification": "Class is small and lacks internal complexity or content that would benefit from further decomposition: loc=35, nom=0 (no methods), nof=1 (single field), wmc=0 (no decision complexity), fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies count=1 (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems given the absence of methods. Based on these metrics the class is already minimal and does not show signs of insufficient modularization."
