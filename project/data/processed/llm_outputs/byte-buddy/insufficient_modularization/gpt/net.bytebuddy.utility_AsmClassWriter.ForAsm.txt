    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an oversized or complex class that needs decomposition: LOC=28 (small), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods / no complexity), NOF=1 (one field), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling/dependencies), DIT=1 and LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issues computable). Given the class is small, has no methods, and has no coupling, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
