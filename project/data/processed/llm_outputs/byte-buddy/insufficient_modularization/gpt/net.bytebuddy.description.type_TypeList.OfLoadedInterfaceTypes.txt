    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC is moderate (75) but there are no declared methods (nom: 0) and no measured cyclomatic complexity (wmc: 0), suggesting absence of large method bodies to split. Coupling is minimal (fanin: 0, fanout: 0) and cohesion metric is high (lcom: -1.0). The class has only a few fields (nof: 4) and a small set of dependencies [net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin]. Given the low internal complexity and low coupling, there is no evidence that it would benefit from further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
