    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC is 58 (not large), number of fields = 1 and number of methods = 0 (nom=0, nopm=0) show the class has minimal internal implementation; WMC = 0 indicates no method complexity; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show very low coupling; dependencies are few (3) and DIT = 1 with no children (nc=0). LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate poor cohesion. Together these elements suggest the class is already small and simple, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
