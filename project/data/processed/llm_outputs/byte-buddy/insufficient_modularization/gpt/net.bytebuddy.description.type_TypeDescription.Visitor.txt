    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC = 37, WMC = 0, NOM = 0, NOF = 0. Lack of methods/fields (nom/nof = 0) and zero measured coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) indicate no large internal implementation to decompose. LCOM = -1.0 (not indicating cohesion problems). While several external types are listed as dependencies, the class metrics in isolation do not show size or complexity that would justify further modularization."
