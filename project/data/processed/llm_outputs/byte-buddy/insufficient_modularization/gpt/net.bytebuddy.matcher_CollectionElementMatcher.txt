    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.CollectionElementMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=41, nom=3, nof=2 and WMC=5 indicate low implementation size and complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited to ElementMatcher and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
