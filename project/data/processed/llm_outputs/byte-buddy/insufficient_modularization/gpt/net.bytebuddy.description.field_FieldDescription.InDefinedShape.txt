    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity (loc=20, wmc=0), no methods or fields to decompose (nom=0, nof=0, nopf=0, nopm=0), no coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0), and shallow inheritance (dit=1). These metrics show no evidence of a large, complex class that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
