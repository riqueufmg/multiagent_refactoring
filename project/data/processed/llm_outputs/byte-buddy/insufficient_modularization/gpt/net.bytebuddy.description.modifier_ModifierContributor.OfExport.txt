    "justification": "Not detected: the class is very small and contains no behavior to decompose (loc=9, nom=0), has a single field (nof=1), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=1 and LCOM=-1.0 do not indicate excess complexity or low cohesion. Given these metrics, further decomposition is not warranted."
