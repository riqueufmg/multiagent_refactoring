    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, high-complexity class: although LOC = 120, the class has no methods (nom = 0), only one field (nof = 1), WMC = 0, fanin = 0 and fanout = 0. DIT = 0 and LCOM = -1.0 (not indicative of cohesion problems). The absence of methods and complexity suggests this is not a large, responsibility-packed implementation that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
