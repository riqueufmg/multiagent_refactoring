    "class": "com.service.usage2.ServiceImplementation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple (loc=5, wmc=1) with a single method (nom=1, nopm=1) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). Cohesion metric is high/acceptable (lcom=-1.0) and there are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the minimal size, low complexity, and lack of multiple responsibilities, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized."
