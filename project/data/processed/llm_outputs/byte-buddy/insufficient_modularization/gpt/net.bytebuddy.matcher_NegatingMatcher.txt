    "justification": "Class is small and simple: 26 LOC, 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3), low complexity (WMC=3), single field (nof=1), high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), shallow inheritance (DIT=0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already well-scoped and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
