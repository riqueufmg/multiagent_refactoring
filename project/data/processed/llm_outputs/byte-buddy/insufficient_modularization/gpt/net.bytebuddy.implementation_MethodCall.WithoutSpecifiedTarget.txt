    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 114 LOC, which is large enough to suggest it may contain multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed. It depends on four distinct external types (TypeDescription, FieldDescription, Assigner, FieldLocator), indicating it touches multiple concerns. The shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and metrics showing no declared methods (nom=0, wmc=0) alongside substantial size imply implementation is concentrated (e.g., large initializer, verbose logic, or many inline behaviors) rather than factored into smaller cooperating units. These factors together indicate Insufficient Modularization and that further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
