    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor.ForModule",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=36, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=4 (few fields). It has no coupling to other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems in the provided data. These metrics show low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
