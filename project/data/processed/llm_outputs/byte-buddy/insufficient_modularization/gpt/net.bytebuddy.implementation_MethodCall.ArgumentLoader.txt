    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size and state: loc=794 and nof=28 indicate a very large class with many fields; High coupling surface: dependencies include ParameterDescription, ParameterList, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, TypeDescription/TypeDefinition, InstrumentedType, Assigner, StackManipulation, FieldLocator, ConstantValue and others, suggesting the class handles multiple distinct responsibilities (argument handling, constant loading, type/field resolution, bytecode assignment/manipulation); Single-class concentration of functionality: given the large LOC and wide variety of dependency domains, the class is likely not fully decomposed and mixes concerns that could be separated into smaller, focused classes or strategies; therefore the class exhibits Insufficient Modularization."
