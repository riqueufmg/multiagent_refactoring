    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.LambdaFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: lines of code = 117 (moderate size), number of methods (nom) = 5 and public methods (nopm) = 4 (small interface), weighted method count (wmc) = 5 (low complexity), number of fields (nof) = 4 (limited state). Cohesion (lcom) = 0.4 suggests reasonable cohesion. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, and only four external dependencies are listed. Given these values (considering the class in isolation), there is insufficient evidence to mark this class as suffering from Insufficient Modularization."
