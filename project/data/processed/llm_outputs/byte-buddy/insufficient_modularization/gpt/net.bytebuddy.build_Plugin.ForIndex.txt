    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForIndex",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 103) while showing no method-level decomposition in the provided metrics (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 5). This combination—high LOC with fields but no reported methods—indicates the implementation is concentrated in a single unit rather than decomposed into smaller, cohesive subcomponents. These elements suggest the class is a candidate for further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
