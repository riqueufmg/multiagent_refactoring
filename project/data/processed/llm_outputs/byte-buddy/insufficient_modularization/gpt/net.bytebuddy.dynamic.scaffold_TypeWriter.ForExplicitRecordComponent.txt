    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForExplicitRecordComponent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and contains no behavioral complexity that would benefit from further decomposition: LOC = 56, NOM (number of methods) = 0, WMC = 0. It has only 2 fields (NOF = 2) and shows no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given the absence of methods and low size/complexity, there is no evidence of a large, monolithic implementation that requires additional modularization. Dependencies listed are limited and do not indicate internal complexity that would motivate decomposition."
