    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=39), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only one field (nof=1), very low cognitive/structural complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), no children (nc=0) and shallow inheritance (dit=1). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal/simple and does not need further decomposition."
