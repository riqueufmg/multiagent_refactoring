    "justification": "Metrics indicate a very small, non‑complex class: LOC=13, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPM=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription). There are no methods or fields to decompose and complexity/coupling are minimal, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
