    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, simple class: LOC=22, NOF=1 (one field), NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no measured complexity). Coupling is minimal (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) and LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issues reported). The class has no internal methods or significant implementation to further decompose; dependencies are external types but do not indicate internal size/complexity. Based on these elements, it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
