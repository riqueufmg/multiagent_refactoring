    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits multiple indicators of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 2648), large number of fields (nof = 80) and methods (nom = 42) with almost all methods exposed (nopm = 41), high complexity (wmc = 58), and only moderate cohesion (lcom = 0.5238095238095238). These metrics imply the class likely contains multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. The long dependency list (many MethodCall.* related types and other collaborators) further suggests the class coordinates many concerns rather than a single, focused responsibility."
