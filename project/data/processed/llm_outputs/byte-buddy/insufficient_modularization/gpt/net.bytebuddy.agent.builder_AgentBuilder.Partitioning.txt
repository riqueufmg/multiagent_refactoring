    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Partitioning",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=49, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, weighted methods complexity (WMC)=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence the class has not been decomposed further."
