    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly complex class: moderate size (loc=104) with no methods (nom=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0); modest number of fields (nof=9); no coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion problem reported). Based on these elements in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
