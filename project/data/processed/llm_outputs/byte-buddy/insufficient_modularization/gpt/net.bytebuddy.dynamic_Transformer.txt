    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large class size (loc = 473) with very few methods (nom = 1) and many fields (nof = 15) indicates a single, monolithic implementation likely doing multiple tasks. Low WMC (1) combined with a single method suggests a long method holding disparate behavior rather than multiple cohesive methods. The class references a wide range of types (ParameterDescription, ParameterList, TypeList, FieldDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, TypeDefinition, ModifierContributor, etc.), implying it spans multiple responsibilities. These elements (high LOC, high NOF, low NOM, and numerous external dependencies) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
