    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForLoadedRecordComponent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=22, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, number of fields (nof)=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only a single declared dependency (RecordComponentDescription). These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
