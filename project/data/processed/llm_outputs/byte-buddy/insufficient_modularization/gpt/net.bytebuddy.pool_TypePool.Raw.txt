    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Raw",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modular: it has a high size (loc = 201) while declaring multiple fields (nof = 7), which indicates concentrated state and implementation in a single class. It also depends on several distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, TypeDescription, RecordComponentDescription and net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool), suggesting the class mixes responsibilities related to types, methods, fields and record components. The combination of large LOC, multiple fields and many different dependency types supports that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
