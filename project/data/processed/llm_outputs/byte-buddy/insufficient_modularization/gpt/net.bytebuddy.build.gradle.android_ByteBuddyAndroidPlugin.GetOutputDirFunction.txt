    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=13, wmc=0, nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0. LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion concerns in this data). fanin=0 and fanout=0 and no listed dependencies. Given the very low size, zero complexity, and absence of methods or interactions, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
