    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has small size and low complexity: loc=31, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0. No methods to decompose and no significant coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM and other metrics do not indicate high cohesion issues. Based on these metrics considered in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized."
