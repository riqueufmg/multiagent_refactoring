    "justification": "Metrics show no internal behavior to decompose: nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are only two external dependencies and no measured cohesion/complexity indicating a large, monolithic implementation. Although LOC=72, the absence of methods/fields and zero complexity means there is no evidence, in isolation, of a class that needs further decomposition."
