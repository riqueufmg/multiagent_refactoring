    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc=2245) and a high element count (nof=61) indicate substantial implementation contained in one class; many distinct nested/auxiliary responsibilities are present as evidenced by the dependencies on numerous inner types (ClassInjector.MethodHandles, ClassInjector.Dispatcher, ClassInjector.UsingUnsafe, ClassInjector.CreationAction, ClassInjector.System, ClassInjector.Jvm, ClassInjector.AccessResolver, ClassInjector.Default, ClassInjector.Lookup, ClassInjector.Initializable, ClassInjector.Target, ClassInjector.Windows32BitFunctionMapper), which suggests multiple responsibilities bundled together; a low reported method complexity (wmc=5) and small nominal method count (nom=5) paired with the large LOC imply functionality is achieved via many embedded components rather than well-separated classes or modules. Together these metrics and listed inner-type responsibilities justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
