    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: loc=16, nom=2, wmc=2, nof=0, nopf=0, nc=0. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. Given the small size, low method count and low complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that it would benefit from additional modularization."
