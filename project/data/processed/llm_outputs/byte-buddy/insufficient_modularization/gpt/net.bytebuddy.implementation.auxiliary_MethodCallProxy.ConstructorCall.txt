    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class: LOC is moderate (59), number of methods (nom) is 0 and WMC is 0 indicating low implementation complexity, number of fields (nof) is only 2, cohesion metric LCOM is -1.0 (no sign of poor cohesion), coupling is minimal (fanin 0, fanout 0), and inheritance depth (DIT 1) is shallow. Given these values and the limited dependency set, there is no evidence in isolation that this class requires further decomposition."
