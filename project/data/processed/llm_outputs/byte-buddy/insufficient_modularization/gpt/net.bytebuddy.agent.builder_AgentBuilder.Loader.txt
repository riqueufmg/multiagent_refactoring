    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Loader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 206 lines of code (loc = 206) while declaring 0 methods (nom = 0) and only 1 field (nof = 1). A large LOC combined with zero decomposed methods indicates substantial implementation content is not modularized into methods, suggesting the class has not been sufficiently decomposed. Additional metrics reinforcing this are WMC = 0 and fanin/fanout = 0, which show no measured method-level structure or external interactions despite the high LOC, supporting the diagnosis of Insufficient Modularization."
