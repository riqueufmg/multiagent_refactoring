    "justification": "Class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc = 16), no methods (nom = 0) and no public/implemented operations (nopf = 0, nopm = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), and no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). lcom = -1.0 (not applicable) and the provided dependencies do not reflect internal complexity. Given the lack of implementation content, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
