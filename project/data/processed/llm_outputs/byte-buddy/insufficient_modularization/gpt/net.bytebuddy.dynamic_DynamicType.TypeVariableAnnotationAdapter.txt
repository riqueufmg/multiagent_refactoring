    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=25, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), WMC=0, DIT=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few external dependencies. Metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
