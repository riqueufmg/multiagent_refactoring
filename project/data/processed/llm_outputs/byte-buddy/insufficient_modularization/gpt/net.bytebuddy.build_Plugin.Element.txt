    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Element",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: LOC = 143 (large size for a single class) while NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no method decomposition recorded) and NOF = 6 (multiple fields present). The combination of high lines of code with multiple fields but no methods suggests responsibilities are not decomposed into smaller methods/classes. LCOM = -1.0 (anomalous cohesion metric) and zero fanin/fanout indicate the class is self-contained yet sizable, reinforcing that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
