    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC = 28, WMC = 0, NOM = 0 (no methods to further split), NOF = 1, DIT = 1 and LCOM = -1.0. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given the low size, lack of methods, and minimal complexity/coupling, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
