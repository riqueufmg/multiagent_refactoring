    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.Factory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively large size (loc = 137) while exposing very little internal decomposition (nom = 0 methods, nof = 1 field). Cohesion metric is invalid/low (lcom = -1.0), and it depends on multiple distinct types (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.PackageDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy), suggesting multiple responsibilities. These elements together indicate the class is likely doing too much in a single unit and could benefit from further decomposition."
