    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not show indicators of insufficient modularization: LOC is 108 but the class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), very low complexity (wmc=0), only 1 field (nof=1), and no coupling measured (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). The absence of many methods, high complexity, or high coupling suggests no evidence that the class is a large, undecomposed unit requiring further modularization."
