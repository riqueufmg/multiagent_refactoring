    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=38, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only a few external dependencies [net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin]. LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issue reported). There is no evidence from these metrics that the class is large, complex, or a candidate for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
