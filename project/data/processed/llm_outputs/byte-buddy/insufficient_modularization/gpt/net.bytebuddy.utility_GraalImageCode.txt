    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.GraalImageCode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively large size (loc = 125) and non-trivial implementation complexity (wmc = 12) while exposing a modest number of methods (nom = 6) with many private helpers (nopm = 4), indicating multiple responsibilities implemented inside a single class rather than clearly separated types. Cohesion is moderate (lcom = 0.5), suggesting methods are not highly cohesive. Together these metrics (high LOC, moderate WMC, multiple private methods, and middling cohesion) justify that further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
