    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: LOC=33, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOF=0. Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, DIT=0) and there are no fields to suggest large state. The modest number of methods and low complexity mean there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modular or would benefit from further decomposition. Dependencies listed do not imply an excessive responsibility concentrated in this class."
