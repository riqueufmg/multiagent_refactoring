    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class inspected in isolation shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=47), only one field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
