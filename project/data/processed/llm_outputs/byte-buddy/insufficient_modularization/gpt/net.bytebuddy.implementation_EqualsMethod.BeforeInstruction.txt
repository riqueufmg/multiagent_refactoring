    "justification": "Class is small and non-complex: LOC=19, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPF=0, NOPM=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. These metrics indicate no methods/fields and no implementation complexity or coupling that would benefit from further decomposition. Dependencies are minimal (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
