    "justification": "Large size (loc = 319) indicates substantial implementation that could be decomposed; zero reported methods (nom = 0) combined with a single field (nof = 1) suggests the code is monolithic rather than split into smaller responsibilities; zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) implies the functionality is concentrated inside this class rather than modularized across collaborators. These elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
