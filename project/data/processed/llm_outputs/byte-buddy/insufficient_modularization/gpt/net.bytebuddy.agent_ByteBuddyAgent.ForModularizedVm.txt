    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal complexity: LOC=13, WMC=0, NOM=0. Coupling and dependencies are absent (NC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no applicable cohesion concerns (no methods to decompose). Given the minimal size and lack of methods or responsibilities, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
