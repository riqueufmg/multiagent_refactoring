    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Value",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: 36 LOC, 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with WMC=0 indicating negligible internal complexity. Fanin and fanout are 0 and there are only two external dependencies, so there is no evidence of a large, complex, or multifaceted implementation that would benefit from further decomposition. LCOM is not informative here (lcom=-1.0) due to the absence of methods. Given these metrics in isolation, the class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
