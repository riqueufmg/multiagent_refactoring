    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor.Dispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a large size (loc = 155) while reporting no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0) and only a small number of fields (nof = 3). The disparity between substantial LOC and zero methods suggests the class bundles multiple responsibilities or large blocks of code (e.g., nested logic, inline handling) instead of smaller, focused units. Additionally, it depends on multiple distinct concerns (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Nexus, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator), indicating mixed responsibilities that could be split. These elements (high LOC, zero methods/complexity metrics, and diverse dependencies) justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
