    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.ForImplicitType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=13, WMC=0, no methods (nom=0), no non-private fields (nopf=0), no fields (nof=0). Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no measurable complexity or cohesion issues (lcom=-1.0). Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
