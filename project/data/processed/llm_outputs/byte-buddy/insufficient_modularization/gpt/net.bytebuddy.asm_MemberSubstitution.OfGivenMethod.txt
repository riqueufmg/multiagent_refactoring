    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfGivenMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=22, no methods (nom=0), single field (nof=1), cyclomatic/complexity metric wmc=0, low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no nested complexity (nc=0). These metrics indicate no evidence that the class needs further decomposition; its size and complexity are minimal and do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
