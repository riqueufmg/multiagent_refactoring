    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of under-modularization: very small size (loc=22), zero methods (nom=0, wmc=0), a single field (nof=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one external dependency. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal/cohesive and do not justify further decomposition."
