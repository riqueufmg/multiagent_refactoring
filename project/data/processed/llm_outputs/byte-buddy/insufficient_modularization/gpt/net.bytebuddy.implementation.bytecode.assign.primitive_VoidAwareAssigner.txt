    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and focused: 33 LOC, 2 methods (nom=2) and only 1 field. Complexity is low to moderate (wmc=5) and cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). Given the small size, high cohesion and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
