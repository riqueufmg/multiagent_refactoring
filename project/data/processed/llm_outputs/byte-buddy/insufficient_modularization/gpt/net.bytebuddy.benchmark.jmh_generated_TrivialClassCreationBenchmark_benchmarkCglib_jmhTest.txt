    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.TrivialClassCreationBenchmark_benchmarkCglib_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large number of fields (nof = 263) and overall size (loc = 275) combined with relatively few methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) and high implementation complexity (wmc = 42). The field-to-method ratio (~29.2 fields per method) indicates concentrated state with little behavioral decomposition, suggesting the class has not been decomposed and could be split to reduce size and complexity."
