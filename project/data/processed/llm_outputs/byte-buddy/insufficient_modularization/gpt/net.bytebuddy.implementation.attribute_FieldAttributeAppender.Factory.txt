    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=52, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no methods to decompose further. Given the low size, zero method count/complexity, single field, and lack of dependencies beyond two listed, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or would benefit from further decomposition."
