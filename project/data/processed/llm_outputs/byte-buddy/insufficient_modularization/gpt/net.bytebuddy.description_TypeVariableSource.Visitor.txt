    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource.Visitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no evidence of being a large or complex unit that needs further decomposition: LOC is 37, NOM = 0, NOPF = 0, WMC = 0, no fields and no methods reported, LCOM is not indicative of cohesion issues, and fan-in/fan-out are 0. It has a single dependency (MethodDescription). Given these metrics taken in isolation, the class is small, low-complexity, and not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization."
