    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=33), zero complexity and behavior (WMC=0, NOM=0), no inheritance depth (DIT=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one external dependency. Although there are 3 fields (NOF=3), the absence of methods/complex logic and low overall complexity provide no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
