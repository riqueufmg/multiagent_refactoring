    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=29, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=1. Low coupling and usage: fanin=0, fanout=0, limited dependencies (StackManipulation, Implementation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Low inheritance depth dit=1 and cohesion metric not indicating internal complexity (lcom=-1.0). These metrics show no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
