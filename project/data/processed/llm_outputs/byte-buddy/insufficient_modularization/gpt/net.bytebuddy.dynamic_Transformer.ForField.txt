    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.ForField",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is relatively large (loc = 130) while exposing multiple fields (nof = 6) but no reported methods (nom = 0), indicating a concentrated amount of state/implementation in a single type. The low inheritance depth (dit = 1) and zero complexity metric (wmc = 0) suggest the class has not been split into smaller cooperating types. The dependency set (FieldDescription, TypeDescription, TypeDefinition, ModifierContributor, Transformer and build plugin) spans several conceptual areas (field description, type handling, modifiers, transformation), implying multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed. The cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) is not positive, reinforcing potential cohesion issues. These elements together justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition."
