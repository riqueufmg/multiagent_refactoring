    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=39), very few fields (nof=3) and no methods reported (nom=0, wmc=0) so there is no internal complexity to decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies only to ParameterDescription and ParameterList). LCOM value (-1.0) and the absence of methods do not indicate low cohesion requiring further decomposition. Therefore no evidence supports further modularization."
