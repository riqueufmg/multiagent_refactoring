    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.MethodCallProxy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization because: it is large (loc = 279) and has many fields (nof = 12), indicating substantial state; it implements multiple behaviors reflected by its dependencies on many distinct concepts (MethodDescription, Assigner, StackManipulation, MethodReturn, MethodAccessorFactory, ConstructorStrategy, MethodGraph, etc.), suggesting multiple responsibilities; it contains several nested/auxiliary types referenced (MethodCallProxy.PrecomputedMethodGraph, MethodCallProxy.ConstructorCall, MethodCallProxy.MethodCall) which implies internal decomposition was attempted but the top-level class remains sizable and complex; its complexity is non-trivial (wmc = 9) while still providing multiple methods (nom = 6) and public surface (nopm = 4). Taken in isolation, these elements indicate the class has not been fully decomposed and further modularization (extracting cohesive subcomponents) could reduce its size and implementation complexity."
