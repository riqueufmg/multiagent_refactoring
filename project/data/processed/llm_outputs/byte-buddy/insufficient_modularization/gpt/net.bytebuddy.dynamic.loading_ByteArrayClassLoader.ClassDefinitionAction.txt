    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc = 42), minimal state (nof = 2) and no methods (nom = 0 / nopm = 0), very low complexity (wmc = 0), high cohesion indicator (lcom = -1.0), and no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Only two external dependencies are listed. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, low cohesion, or excessive responsibilities that would justify further decomposition."
