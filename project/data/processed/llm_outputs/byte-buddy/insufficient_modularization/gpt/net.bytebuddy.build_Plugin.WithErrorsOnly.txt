    "justification": "Class analyzed in isolation shows no evidence of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=28), zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and minimal external dependency (1). With no substantial implementation to decompose, further modularization is not indicated."
