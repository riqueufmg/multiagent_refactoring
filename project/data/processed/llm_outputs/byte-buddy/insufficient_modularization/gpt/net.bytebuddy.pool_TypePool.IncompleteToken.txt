    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.IncompleteToken",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc=189) while declaring no methods (nom=0) and a non-trivial number of fields (nof=5). A large physical size with zero methods indicates that functionality/state is concentrated in the class body (initializers, many fields, or embedded logic) instead of being decomposed into smaller, focused units. wmc=0 and nom=0 show procedural complexity is not expressed via methods but the class still occupies substantial code, and lcom=-1.0 indicates low/poor cohesion. The minimal external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and the use of HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin suggest generated boilerplate contributes to size but does not address decomposition. These characteristics are consistent with Insufficient Modularization: the class appears not fully decomposed and could be split to reduce size and implementation complexity."
