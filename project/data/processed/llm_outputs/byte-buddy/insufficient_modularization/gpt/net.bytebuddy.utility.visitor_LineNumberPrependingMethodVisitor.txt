    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=32, number of methods=3 (nom=3), number of fields=2 (nof=2). Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is low (WMC=4). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no indication of insufficient modularization."
