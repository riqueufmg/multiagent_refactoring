    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no sign of being under-decomposed: number of fields (nof)=1, number of methods (nom)=0 and number of private methods (nopm)=0 indicate minimal internal structure; weighted method count (wmc)=0 shows no method complexity to split; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate low coupling; although loc=74 is moderate, without internal methods or complexity there is no clear candidate functionality to extract. Dependencies are limited and do not suggest aggregated responsibilities. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
