    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High number of fields with no behavior: nof=256 while nom=0 and wmc=0, with very low LOC=18. This large aggregation of data (256 fields) without methods or internal decomposition indicates the class groups many responsibilities/attributes and could be split into smaller classes (insufficient modularization). Additional supporting metrics: nc=1, dit=1, fanin=0, fanout=0 — the class is isolated but monolithic, reinforcing the need for further decomposition."
