    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undifferentiated, high-complexity class that would benefit from further decomposition. Although LOC = 132, the class shows no measured behavioral complexity (WMC = 0, NOM = 0, NC = 0), a small number of fields (NOF = 5), and no measured coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). LCOM = -1.0 and lack of methods suggest cohesion measures are not indicating poor modularization. The modest number of external type dependencies (listed) does not by itself imply an undecomposed class. On balance, the provided metrics do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
