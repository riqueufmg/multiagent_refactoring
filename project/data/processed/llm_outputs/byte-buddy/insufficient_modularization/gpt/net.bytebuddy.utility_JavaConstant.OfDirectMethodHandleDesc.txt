    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=41, NOF=0, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. With no fields or methods and minimal size and coupling (single dependency listed), there is no evidence that the class is too large or complex and therefore no indication of Insufficient Modularization."
