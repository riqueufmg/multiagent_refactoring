    "justification": "The class is very large (LOC = 1079) and contains a large number of fields (nof = 32), which indicates substantial implementation concentrated in a single class. It also depends on multiple distinct types (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility), suggesting it mixes multiple responsibilities. These factors together are strong indicators of Insufficient Modularization and motivate decomposition into smaller, cohesive units."
