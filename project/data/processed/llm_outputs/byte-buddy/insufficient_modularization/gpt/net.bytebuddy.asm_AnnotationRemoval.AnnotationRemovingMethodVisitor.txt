    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AnnotationRemoval.AnnotationRemovingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small size (loc=44), very low complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 2 listed dependencies) and cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not suggest decomposition is needed. Given these elements, the class does not appear to require further decomposition."
