    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC is only 50 (not large), number of methods (nom) = 0 and WMC = 0 (no implementation complexity to decompose), number of fields (nof) = 1 (small state), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (low coupling), dependencies limited to two types, and LCOM = -1.0 (no evidence of low cohesion). Taken in isolation, there is no metric-based evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
