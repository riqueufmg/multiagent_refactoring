    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and simple: loc=13, wmc=0, nom=0, nof=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no declared methods or fields and coupling is minimal (dependencies only list three types). Given the low size and complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
