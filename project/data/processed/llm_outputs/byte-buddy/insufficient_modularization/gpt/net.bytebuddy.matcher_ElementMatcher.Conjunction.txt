    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC = 57, NOM = 0, WMC = 0, nof = 1, fanin = 0, fanout = 0. LCOM = -1 (no cohesion issues indicated). There are only build/plugin dependencies and no internal method complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
