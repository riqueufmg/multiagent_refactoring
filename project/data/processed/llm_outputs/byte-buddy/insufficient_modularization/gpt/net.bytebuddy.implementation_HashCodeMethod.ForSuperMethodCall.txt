    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.ForSuperMethodCall",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=17, number of methods=0, number of fields=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only one listed dependency (StackManipulation). Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
