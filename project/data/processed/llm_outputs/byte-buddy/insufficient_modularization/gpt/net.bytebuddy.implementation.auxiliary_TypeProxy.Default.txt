    "justification": "Metrics show no indication of an oversized or complex class: LOC=26 (small), NOM=0 and NOF=0 (no methods or fields to decompose), WMC=0 (no internal complexity), NC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling pressure). Only a single external dependency is listed. Given the absence of methods/fields, low size and complexity, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition; insufficient modularization is not detected."
