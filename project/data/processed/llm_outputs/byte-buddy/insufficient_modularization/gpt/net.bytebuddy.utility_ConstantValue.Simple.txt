    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows low internal complexity and responsibilities: only 2 fields (nof=2), no methods recorded (nom=0, nopm=0) and a low weighted method count (wmc=0). Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and depth is shallow (dit=1). Cohesion metric is favorable (lcom=-1.0). Although LOC is 85, the absence of methods and low complexity/coupling indicate this is a simple data-holder/utility structure rather than a large class that requires further decomposition."
