    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an oversized or complex class that needs further decomposition: LOC is 99 (moderate size), WMC = 0 (no measured method complexity), NOF = 0 and NOM = 0 (no fields or methods reported), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling evidence), DIT = 1 (shallow inheritance). LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate low cohesion in the provided data. Based on these elements taken in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
