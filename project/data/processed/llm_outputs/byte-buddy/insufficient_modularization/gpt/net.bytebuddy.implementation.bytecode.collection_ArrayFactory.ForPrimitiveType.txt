    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayFactory.ForPrimitiveType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: it has 0 methods (nom=0) and WMC=0 indicating no internal method complexity, only 2 fields (nof=2) and moderate size (loc=64) but no measured responsibilities or coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). With no methods or measured complexity to decompose, there is no evidence that the class contains multiple cohesive responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition."
