    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class size and state: LOC = 244 (relatively large) and NOF = 7 fields; Behavior/structure imbalance: NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods recorded) indicating large amount of code and state concentrated without decomposed behaviors; Cohesion/complexity signals: LCOM = -1.0 (no clear cohesion measurement) while fanin/fanout = 0 (isolated but likely monolithic); Dependency spread: listed dependencies (AsmVisitorWrapper, MethodDescription, TypeWriter, ClassFileVersion, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, MethodComparator) suggest multiple responsibilities/concerns. Taken together, these elements indicate the class is not sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
