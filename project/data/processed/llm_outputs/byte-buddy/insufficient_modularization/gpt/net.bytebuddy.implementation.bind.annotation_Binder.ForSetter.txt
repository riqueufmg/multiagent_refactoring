    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.ForSetter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=34, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. Low complexity and no methods to decompose (NOM=0, WMC=0). Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and DIT=0 indicate no inheritance-driven complexity. LCOM=-1.0 provides no indication of cohesion problems. No metric suggests the class is insufficiently modularized, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
