    "justification": "Class is small and trivial: LOC=31, number of fields (nof)=0, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant). LCOM is not indicative (-1.0). Given the lack of size, methods, or complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
