    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.PluginArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity (LOC=20, WMC=1) with only one method (NOM=1) and two fields (NOF=2). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and there are no incoming or outgoing coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed sufficiently or that it would benefit from further modularization."
