    "justification": "Class is small and simple so further decomposition is not indicated: LOC=48, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, number of fields (nof)=1, fan-in=0, fan-out=0, DIT=0. Cohesion metric (LCOM) not showing a decomposition need and dependencies are minimal. These elements indicate the class is already sufficiently modular."
