    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: size is modest (loc=82), complexity is minimal (wmc=0, nom=0), field count is small (nof=3), coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence of many responsibilities, large method count, or high complexity that would justify further decomposition. The provided dependencies are limited and do not imply high external coupling."
