    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.Disabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no behavior or state to decompose: nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), nopm=0, nopf=0. Complexity and cohesion metrics indicate no internal implementation to split (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0). Size is minimal (loc=13) and there is no coupling to other code (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Given these metrics and isolated view, there is no evidence that the class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
