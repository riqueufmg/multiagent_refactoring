    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.Dispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 758) and declares a high number of fields (nof = 27, nopf = 6). Such a large size combined with many fields indicates multiple responsibilities or grouped functionality that could be separated. Additionally, nom = 0 and wmc = 0 suggest the class contains little or no method-level decomposition despite its size, reinforcing that it has not been sufficiently modularized and would likely benefit from being split into smaller classes or components."
