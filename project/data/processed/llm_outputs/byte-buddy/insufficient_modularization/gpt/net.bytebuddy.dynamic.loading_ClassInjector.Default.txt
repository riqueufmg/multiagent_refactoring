    "justification": "The class is small and contains no decomposable implementation: LOC=13, NOM=0, NOPF=0, NOPM=0, WMC=0. Coupling and dependencies are absent (fanin=0, fanout=0). With no methods or fields to split and very low complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
