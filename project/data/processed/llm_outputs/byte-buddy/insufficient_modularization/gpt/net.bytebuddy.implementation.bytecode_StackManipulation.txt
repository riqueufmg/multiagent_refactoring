    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the file has 209 LOC, the class shows very low internal complexity and size metrics (WMC = 2, NOM = 2) and a small number of fields (NOF = 5). Inheritance depth is 0 (DIT = 0), coupling indicators are minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and the provided cohesion metric is not indicative of fragmentation (LCOM = -1.0). The listed dependencies include nested types (StackManipulation.Size, Dispatcher), which suggest existing decomposition rather than a single monolithic implementation. Taken in isolation, these metrics do not support flagging Insufficient Modularization."
