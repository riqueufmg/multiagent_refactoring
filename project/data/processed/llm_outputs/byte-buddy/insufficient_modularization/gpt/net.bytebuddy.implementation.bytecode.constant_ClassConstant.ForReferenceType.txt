    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=35, NOF=1, NOM=0, NOPM=0 and WMC=0 indicate minimal implementation and complexity. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and DIT=1; there is no sign of multiple responsibilities or a large, undecomposed implementation. Given these metrics, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
