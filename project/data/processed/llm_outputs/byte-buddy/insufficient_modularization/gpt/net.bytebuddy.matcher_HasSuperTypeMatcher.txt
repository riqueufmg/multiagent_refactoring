    "justification": "Class has small size and limited responsibilities: LOC=47, methods=3 (nom=3, nopm=2), fields=1 (nof=1). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and complexity is modest (WMC=9). No deep inheritance (DIT=0) and no external coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics show the class is cohesive and not excessively large or complex, so further decomposition is not warranted."
