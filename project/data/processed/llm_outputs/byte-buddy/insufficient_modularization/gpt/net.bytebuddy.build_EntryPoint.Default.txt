    "justification": "Metrics show no evidence of an under-decomposed class: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted methods per class (wmc) = 0 indicate no internal behavioral complexity to split; lack of fields/methods (nof=0, nopf=0) means nothing substantial to modularize. Size is modest (loc = 72) and coupling is low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) with only three listed type dependencies, so there is no data suggesting further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
