    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.RequiresDefinitionAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=47), very low implementation complexity (wmc=0), no methods reported (nom=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only two external dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
