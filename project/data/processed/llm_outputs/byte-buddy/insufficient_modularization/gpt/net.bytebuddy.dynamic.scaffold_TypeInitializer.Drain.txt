    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer.Drain",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc = 46), no methods (nom = 0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc = 0) indicate little implementation to decompose; only three fields (nof = 3) and no public fields (nopf = 0) imply limited internal state; low coupling metrics (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) show it is not entangled with other classes. The cohesion metric is not informative (lcom = -1.0). Given these values, further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
