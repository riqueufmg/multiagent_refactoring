    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForPatchWithOverlap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=35), minimal state (nof=1, nopf=0), no methods reported (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0). Low coupling and interaction (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (dit=0). These metrics indicate the class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition."
