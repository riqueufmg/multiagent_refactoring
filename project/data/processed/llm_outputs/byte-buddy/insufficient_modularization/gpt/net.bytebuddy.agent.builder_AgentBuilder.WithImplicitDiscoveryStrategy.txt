    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, non-complex class: LOC=17, number of fields=0, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Coupledness is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM is -1.0 (no cohesion data), but there is no evidence of large size or high complexity that would indicate a need for further decomposition. Therefore, Insufficient Modularization is not detected for this class."
