    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=26), no measured complexity (WMC=0), no reported methods or fields (nom, nopm, nopf = 0), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. The LCOM value (-1.0) is anomalous but, taken in isolation with the other metrics, does not indicate a need for further decomposition."
