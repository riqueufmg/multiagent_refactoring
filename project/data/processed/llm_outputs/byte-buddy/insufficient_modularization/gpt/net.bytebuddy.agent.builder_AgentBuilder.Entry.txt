    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Entry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class. The class has modest size (loc=79), very low implementation complexity (wmc=0), no methods to split up (nom=0, nopm=0), and only a few fields (nof=4). Cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0) and there is no significant coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these values and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
