    "justification": "Not detected: the class has small size and no internal decomposition candidates. Metrics show LOC=53, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and only minimal external dependencies. With zero methods and no measured complexity or coupling, there is no evidence that the class contains multiple responsibilities that could be further modularized."
