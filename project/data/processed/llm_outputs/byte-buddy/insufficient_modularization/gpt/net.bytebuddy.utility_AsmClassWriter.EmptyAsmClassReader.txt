    "justification": "The class shows no indicators of insufficient modularization: nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), loc=49 (small size), dit=1 (shallow inheritance). There are no dependencies and LCOM is not indicating cohesion problems. Given the absence of methods/fields, low complexity and small size, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
