    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=39, NOF=2, NOM=0, WMC=0. Coupling indicators show no external interactions (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). There are no methods to split and minimal state (2 fields), so there is no evidence that this class is insufficiently modularized."
