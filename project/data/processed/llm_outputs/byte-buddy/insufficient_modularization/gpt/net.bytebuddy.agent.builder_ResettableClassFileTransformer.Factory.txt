    "justification": "Metrics show no clear signs of insufficient modularization: loc=76 but nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods and no measured complexity), nof=1 (single field), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling evidence). Dependencies are present but limited. In isolation there is no evidence of high complexity, many responsibilities, or high coupling that would justify further decomposition."
