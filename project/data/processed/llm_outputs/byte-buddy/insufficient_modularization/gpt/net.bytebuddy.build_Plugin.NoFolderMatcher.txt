    "justification": "The class is very small and shows no signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=13, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), WMC=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), a single dependency, and DIT=1. LCOM is not indicating cohesion issues. These metrics do not justify further decomposition."
