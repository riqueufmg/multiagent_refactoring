    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: number of methods (nom)=0 and number of fields (nof)=1 show minimal internal structure; weighted method count (wmc)=0 indicates no method complexity; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate no coupling pressure to split; although loc=47 is moderate, there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or high implementation complexity (lcom=-1.0, no methods) that would justify further decomposition."
