    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal structure to decompose: LOC=18, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=0. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no methods or fields indicating internal complexity. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
