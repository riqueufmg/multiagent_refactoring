    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc=583) which strongly suggests it contains multiple responsibilities that could be split; it has a non-trivial number of fields (nof=9) and depends on several distinct concerns (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, TypeList, AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), indicating coupling to multiple responsibilities; cohesion/metric signals are suspicious (lcom=-1.0) and there is an inconsistency in reported method/complexity metrics (nom=0, wmc=0) despite high LOC, all of which justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from further decomposition."
