    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Delegating",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 611) indicating high implementation volume in a single class; large number of fields (nof = 21) suggesting multiple responsibilities or state groups that could be split; no recorded method decomposition (nom = 0) which implies behavior is not modularized into smaller methods/classes; and multiple distinct external dependencies (Implementation, MethodDescription, Assigner, TypeDescription, AnnotationDescription, StackManipulation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) indicating the class touches several concerns. Together these elements justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
