    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer.WithCallback",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected: the class has a large size (loc=146) while reporting no methods (nom=0) and no complexity measured (wmc=0), which indicates substantial code not decomposed into methods. Cohesion metric is suspicious (lcom=-1.0) and there are multiple external dependencies (6 listed), together with three fields (nof=3). The combination of high LOC, low/absent method decomposition and low cohesion supports that this class is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from further decomposition."
