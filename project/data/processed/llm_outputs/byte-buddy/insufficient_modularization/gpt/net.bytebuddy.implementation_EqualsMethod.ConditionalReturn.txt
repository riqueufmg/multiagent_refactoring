    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.ConditionalReturn",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC is moderate (90), there are no methods (nom=0) and no method complexity (wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (dit=0). These values show low complexity and low coupling, so there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
