    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and carrying multiple responsibilities: LOC = 1134, nom (number of methods) = 31, nof (number of fields) = 37 and WMC = 31. DIT = 0 and fanin/fanout = 0 indicate it is self-contained rather than distributed across an inheritance hierarchy. The dependency list includes several nested/related types (MethodDelegation.WithCustomProperties, MethodDelegation.ForField, MethodDelegation.Compiled, MethodDelegation.ImplementationDelegate) that suggest multiple roles or sub-responsibilities are bundled into this single class. While LCOM = 0.0968 indicates reasonable cohesion, the absolute size (LOC) and high counts of methods and fields support that further decomposition could reduce class size and implementation complexity."
