    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.OfField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show symptoms of Insufficient Modularization when considered in isolation: very small size (loc=35), no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc=0), only two fields (nof=2), and no incoming/outgoing coupling measured (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependencies are minimal. These metrics indicate the class is small and simple and does not require further decomposition."
