    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: loc=32, number of fields (nof)=2, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted methods complexity (wmc)=0. Low coupling: fanout=0 and only two listed dependencies. There is no evidence of high size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition. Based on these provided metrics in isolation, Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
