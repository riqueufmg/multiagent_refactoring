    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=30, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, and no dependencies. There are no methods or fields to decompose and cyclomatic complexity is zero, so there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity. Based on these isolated metrics, Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
