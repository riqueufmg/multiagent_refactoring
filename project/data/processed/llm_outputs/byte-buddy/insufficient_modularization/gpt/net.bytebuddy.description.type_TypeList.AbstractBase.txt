    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=58), no methods reported (nom=0) and zero complexity (WMC=0) => no large monolithic implementation; cohesion metric not indicating problems (LCOM=-1.0, likely no cohesion issues or not applicable). Low coupling indications: fan-in=0, fan-out=0 and only a small set of declared dependencies (TypeDescription, TypeList, ByteCodeElement, FilterableList). Based on these elements in isolation, there is no evidence that this class needs further decomposition."
