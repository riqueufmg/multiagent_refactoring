    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Counts and cohesion indicate decomposition opportunity: 134 LOC and WMC=16 show moderate size and complexity; nom=9 methods with nof=4 fields and high LCOM=0.7778 (low cohesion) imply the class implements multiple, weakly related responsibilities. The presence of a nested/related type (WithFlip) and dependencies across distinct concerns (StackManipulation, StackSize, Implementation, TypeDefinition) further suggest separable functionality that could be extracted to reduce complexity and improve modularity."
