    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfMatchedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=28), minimal state (nof=2 fields), no reported methods or complexity (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0), and no coupling or usage pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low cohesion/metric value (lcom=-1.0) and only three external dependencies do not indicate a large, complex class that should be further decomposed."
