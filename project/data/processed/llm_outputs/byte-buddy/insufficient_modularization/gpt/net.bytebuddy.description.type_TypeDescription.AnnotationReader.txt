    "justification": "Detected based on size and coupling indicators in the provided data: loc = 847 (very large class body) and nof = 30 (many fields) which suggest substantial internal complexity and state; dependencies include net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, and net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, indicating the class interacts with multiple concerns. These metrics (large LOC and many fields) combined with multiple external dependencies are characteristic signs that the class has not been fully decomposed and could be further modularized."
