    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForInstrumentedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (loc=25), no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no coupling pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Given these metrics there is no evidence the class is large or complex and therefore no indication it needs further decomposition."
