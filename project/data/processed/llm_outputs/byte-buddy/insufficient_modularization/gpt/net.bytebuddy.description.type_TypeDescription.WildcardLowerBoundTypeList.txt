    "justification": "Class net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.WildcardLowerBoundTypeList shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=34), very low complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0), only two fields (nof=2), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single dependency (TypeList). These metrics indicate a simple, focused class with no clear need for further decomposition."
