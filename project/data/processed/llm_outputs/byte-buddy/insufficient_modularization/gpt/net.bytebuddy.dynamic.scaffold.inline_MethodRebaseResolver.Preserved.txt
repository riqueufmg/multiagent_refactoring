    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that needs further decomposition: LOC=34, NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0, NOF=1 (single field), FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, minimal dependencies. With no methods and very low size/complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
