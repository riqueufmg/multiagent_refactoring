    "justification": "Metrics show the class is small and non-complex: loc=29, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=2, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods and minimal state, and coupling is nil aside from a build plugin dependency. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem in the provided data. In isolation these indicators do not justify further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
