    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Adjustment.CompoundIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of incomplete decomposition: it has only 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) despite 57 lines (loc=57), indicating small/limited implementation surface rather than a large, monolithic class. Complexity metrics are minimal (wmc=0), cohesion metric is not indicative of fragmentation (lcom=-1.0), and there are no external interactions (fanin=0, fanout=0). Based on these metrics in isolation, there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
