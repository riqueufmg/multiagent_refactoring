    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithPrefixWithTypePool_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has an extremely large number of fields (nof = 263) while exposing relatively few methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) and modest size (loc = 276). The fields-to-methods ratio and sheer field count indicate the class is undertaking many responsibilities or holding many distinct data elements that could be split into separate classes/modules. Complexity (wmc = 42) and the total LOC further support maintenance and comprehension concerns. Although cohesion is reported as lcom = 0.0, the disproportionate field count alone justifies recommending further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
