    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is large (loc = 331) while exposing few methods (nom = 6), implying large/complex method bodies (≈55 LOC/method). It contains multiple nested/related types referenced in dependencies (AsmClassReader.JdkClassReader, AsmClassReader.ForClassFileApi, AsmClassReader.Factory, AsmClassReader.Default) which suggests several responsibilities or bundled functionality that could be split out. Although cyclomatic/method complexity (wmc = 6) is moderate, the combination of high overall size, few methods, multiple inner types, and a non-hierarchical design (dit = 0) indicates the implementation can be decomposed further to reduce size and implementation complexity."
