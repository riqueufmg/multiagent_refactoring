    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.AnnotationExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 141) and a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 8) indicate multiple responsibilities or state that could be split. Its dependencies span both annotation modeling (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue) and low-level class reading (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader), suggesting it mixes parsing and extraction concerns. These factors (high LOC, many fields, and cross-cutting dependencies) justify recommending further decomposition."
