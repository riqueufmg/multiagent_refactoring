    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: an extremely large number of fields (nof = 263) combined with a small number of methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) indicates many data elements are bundled into a single class rather than factored into cohesive subcomponents. Additional supporting metrics: lines of code loc = 276 and weighted methods complexity wmc = 42, which together show substantial internal implementation complexity. These elements (high nof, relatively low nom, non-trivial wmc and loc) justify that the class should be decomposed into smaller, more modular classes."
