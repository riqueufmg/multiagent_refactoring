    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: moderate size (loc=70), no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although there are 5 fields (nof=5), the absence of methods and low coupling suggest a simple data/delegate role rather than a large, multifaceted class that would benefit from further decomposition. Dependencies are few and no complexity/cohesion indicators point to insufficient modularization."
