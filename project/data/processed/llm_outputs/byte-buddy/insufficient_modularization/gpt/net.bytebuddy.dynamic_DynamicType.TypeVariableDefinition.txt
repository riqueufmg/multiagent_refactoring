    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 165) while reporting no declared fields or methods (nof = 0, nom = 0, nopf = 0, nopm = 0). This mismatch (large LOC with zero modular elements) together with zero reported complexity aggregation (wmc = 0) and no fan-in/fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) indicates the implementation is not decomposed into smaller, cohesive units. The presence of dependencies on TypeList and AnnotationList suggests multiple concerns related to type and annotation handling that could be split out. These elements point to Insufficient Modularization: the class appears monolithic and would likely benefit from further decomposition."
