    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.BootstrapArgumentResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 109) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc = 0), indicating substantial code that has not been decomposed into separate methods. It also exposes state (nof = 4) and depends on multiple external types (TypeDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, MethodDescription, JavaConstant), suggesting multiple responsibilities. These factors together point to insufficient modularization: a class that should be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
