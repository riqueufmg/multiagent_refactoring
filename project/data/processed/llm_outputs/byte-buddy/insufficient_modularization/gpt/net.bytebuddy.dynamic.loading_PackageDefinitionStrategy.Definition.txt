    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy.Definition",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 312) while containing multiple fields (nof = 9) and no methods reported (nom = 0, nopm = 0, wmc = 0). The combination of high LOC with several fields but no method decomposition indicates the class likely bundles too much implementation/state and could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity. Metrics show no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), so the class should be evaluated in isolation and still appears to suffer from insufficient modularization."
