    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.StaticFieldByteCodeAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: loc=22, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no measured complexity), dit=1 (shallow inheritance). Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no measures indicating high cohesion problems (lcom=-1.0). Given the low size, zero method complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
