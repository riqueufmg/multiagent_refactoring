    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modularized: it has a relatively large size (loc = 135) and a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 7), while depending on many external components (9 listed dependencies: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder), which suggests multiple responsibilities. Cohesion data is not informative (lcom = -1.0) and method metrics are zero (nom = 0), but the combination of high LOC, several fields, and many dependencies supports that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
