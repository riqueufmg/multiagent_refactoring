    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin.WithProperty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=26), no methods (nom=0) and low complexity (wmc=0), a single field (nof=1), no inheritance depth (dit=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no cohesion warning (lcom=-1.0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and decomposed, so further modularization is not warranted based on the provided data."
