    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: there are 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), WMC=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), and no dependencies. LOC=78 alone is insufficient to claim inadequate decomposition given the absence of methods/fields and low complexity; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
