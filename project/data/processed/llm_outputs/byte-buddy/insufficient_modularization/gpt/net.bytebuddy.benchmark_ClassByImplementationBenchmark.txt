    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.ClassByImplementationBenchmark",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 370), many fields (nof = 22), many methods (nom = 32) with most public (nopm = 29), and high cyclomatic/behavioral complexity (wmc = 66). Cohesion is low (lcom = 0.6875), indicating multiple responsibilities or weakly related members. These factors together (large LOC, high WMC, many public methods/fields, and low cohesion) justify decomposing the class into smaller, more focused modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
