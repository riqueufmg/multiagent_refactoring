    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.CircularityLock",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size (loc=201) combined with 7 fields (nof=7) but no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero method complexity (wmc=0) indicates the class contains substantial implementation/data without being decomposed into smaller behavioral units. The absence of methods prevents internal modularization and the single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) suggests auto-generated utilities rather than deliberate decomposition. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
