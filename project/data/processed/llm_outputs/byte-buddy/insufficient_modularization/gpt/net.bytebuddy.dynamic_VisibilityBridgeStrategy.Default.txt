    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.VisibilityBridgeStrategy.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=37), no methods reported (nom=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex and does not require further decomposition."
