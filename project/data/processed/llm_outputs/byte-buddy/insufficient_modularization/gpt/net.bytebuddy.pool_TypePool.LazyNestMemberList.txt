    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=58), very low complexity (WMC=0), no methods (nom=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3). Cohesion and coupling indicators do not suggest decomposition needs (LCOM=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependencies are limited to three types and do not indicate an overly large responsibility. Therefore no further decomposition is indicated based on the provided metrics."
