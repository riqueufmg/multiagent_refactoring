    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithPrefix_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: an extremely high number of fields (nof = 263) combined with a moderate size (loc = 276) and substantial complexity (wmc = 42). There are relatively few methods (nom = 9) compared to fields, resulting in a high fields-to-methods ratio (≈29:1), which indicates the class is holding a large amount of state rather than being decomposed into smaller cohesive units. Although lcom = 0.0 suggests measured cohesion is not missing, the sheer count of fields and overall complexity justify refactoring/splitting the class to reduce size and implementation complexity."
