    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=23, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1, NOPF=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, DIT=0, NC=0. These metrics show very low size, no methods/complexity, and no coupling that would indicate an undecomposed responsibility. The reported LCOM=-1.0 appears to be an outlier/unreliable value and does not contradict the small, low-complexity profile. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
