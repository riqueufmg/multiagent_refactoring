    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive, so further decomposition is not indicated. Metrics: LOC=26, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOF=1, NOPM=2, LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). Low coupling/interaction (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its small size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
