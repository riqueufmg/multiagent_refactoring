    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Division",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=46, NOM=3, WMC=3. It has no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). Although LCOM=0.6667 indicates a moderate cohesion concern, the overall size and low complexity (few methods and low cyclomatic weight) do not justify further decomposition in isolation. Dependencies are minimal (2), so there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization from the provided metrics."
