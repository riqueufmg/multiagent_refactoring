    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=58), has only 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods (nom=0), zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), and no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The reported cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) is not supported by any methods to indicate poor cohesion. Dependencies are minimal (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin). These metrics indicate the class is concise and not a candidate for further decomposition."
