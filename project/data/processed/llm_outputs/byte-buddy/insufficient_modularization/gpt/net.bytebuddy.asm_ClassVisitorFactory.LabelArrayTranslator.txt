    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed / overly large class. LOC is 65 (moderate size), WMC is 0 and NOM is 0 (no method-level complexity or many methods), NOF is 3 (few fields), DIT is 1, FANIN and FANOUT are 0. There is no evidence of high complexity, many responsibilities, or large method bodies that would suggest further decomposition is needed."
