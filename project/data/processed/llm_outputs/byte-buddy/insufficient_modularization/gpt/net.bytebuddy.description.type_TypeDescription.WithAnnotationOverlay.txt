    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.WithAnnotationOverlay",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=46), very low structural complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0), only two fields (nof=2), minimal coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0) and only two dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationSource). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
