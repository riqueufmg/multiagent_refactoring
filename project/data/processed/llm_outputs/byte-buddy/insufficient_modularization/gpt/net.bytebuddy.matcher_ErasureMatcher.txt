    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ErasureMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=26, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOF=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating minimal coupling. Given the low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence this class has not been fully decomposed or would benefit from further modularization."
