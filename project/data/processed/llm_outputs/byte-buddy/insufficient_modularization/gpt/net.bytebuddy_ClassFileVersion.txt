    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=476) with a high number of fields (nof=36) and many methods (nom=26, nopm=24). Complexity metric is elevated (wmc=34) while the class also references multiple role-like collaborators (inner/related types listed in dependencies such as ClassFileVersion.VersionLocator and ClassFileVersion.Resolver). Although cohesion is not poor (lcom=0.192), the combination of large LOC, many fields and public methods, and multiple embedded responsibilities suggests the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
