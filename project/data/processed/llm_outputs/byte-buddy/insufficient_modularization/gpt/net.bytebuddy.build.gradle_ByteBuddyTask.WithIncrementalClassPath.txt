    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=11), no methods (nom=0), no public fields (nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. DIT=2 and LCOM value are not evidence of an overly large or complex class in this data set. The class appears minimal/empty from the provided metrics, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the given information."
