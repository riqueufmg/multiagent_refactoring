    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization: LOC is moderate (116) but there are no methods (nom=0) and no method complexity (wmc=0), indicating the class does not contain a large, complex implementation that should be further decomposed. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric is not indicative of fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). Although there are 7 fields (nof=7) and several external type dependencies, the lack of methods/complex logic provides no evidence that the class bundles multiple responsibilities or needs further decomposition."
