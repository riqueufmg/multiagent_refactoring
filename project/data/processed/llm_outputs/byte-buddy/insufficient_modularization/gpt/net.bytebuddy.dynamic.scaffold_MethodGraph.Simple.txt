    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=41, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method complexity (wmc)=0, single field (nof=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no apparent internal complexity to decompose. Given these values and the constraint to consider the class in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
