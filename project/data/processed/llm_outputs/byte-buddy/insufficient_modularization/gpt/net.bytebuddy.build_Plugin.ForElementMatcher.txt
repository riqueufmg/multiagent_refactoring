    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=22, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0. It has no methods to decompose (NOM=0), minimal state (NOF=1), zero fan-in/out (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two dependencies. Although DIT=2, the overall size and complexity metrics indicate there is no need for further decomposition."
