    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that needs decomposition: LOC = 46 (small), NOM = 0, NOF = 0, WMC = 0, FANIN = 0, FANOUT = 0. There are no methods or fields to split and low coupling (only two external dependencies). Given the lack of internal members and complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
