    "justification": "LCOM = 0.8571428571428571 (high lack of cohesion) combined with nom = 7 methods and only nof = 1 field indicates the class’s methods are largely unrelated to the same state. WMC = 7 and LOC = 60 show nontrivial implementation complexity concentrated in a single class. These metrics together suggest the class is not sufficiently decomposed and could be split to reduce size and complexity."
