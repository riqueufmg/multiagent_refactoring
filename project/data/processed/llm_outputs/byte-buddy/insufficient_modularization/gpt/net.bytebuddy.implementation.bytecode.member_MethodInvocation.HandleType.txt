    "justification": "Do not detect Insufficient Modularization: the class is small and not complex (loc=28), contains only a single field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), and minimal coupling/cohesion indicators (lcom=-1.0). These metrics indicate there is no evidence this class requires further decomposition."
