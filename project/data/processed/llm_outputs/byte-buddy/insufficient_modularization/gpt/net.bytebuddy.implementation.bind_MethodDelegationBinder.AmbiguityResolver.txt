    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.AmbiguityResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a non-trivial size (loc = 146) while aggregating interactions with many distinct resolver types (dependencies include DeclaringTypeResolver, ArgumentTypeResolver, ParameterLengthResolver, MethodNameEqualityResolver, the enclosing MethodDelegationBinder and annotation.Resolver). The class name (AmbiguityResolver) and the presence of multiple resolver dependencies indicate it coordinates multiple resolution responsibilities. Together with four fields (nof = 4) this suggests the class is shouldering multiple concerns and could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
