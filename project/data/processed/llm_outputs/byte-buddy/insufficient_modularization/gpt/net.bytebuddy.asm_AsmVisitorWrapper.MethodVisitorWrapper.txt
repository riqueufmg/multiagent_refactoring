    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.MethodVisitorWrapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate this inner class is very small and not complex: LOC=17, NOM=0, WMC=0, no fields (NOF=0), no methods, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and only one external dependency. LCOM=-1.0 is not indicative of large internal cohesion issues. Given the absence of methods/fields and minimal size/complexity, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
