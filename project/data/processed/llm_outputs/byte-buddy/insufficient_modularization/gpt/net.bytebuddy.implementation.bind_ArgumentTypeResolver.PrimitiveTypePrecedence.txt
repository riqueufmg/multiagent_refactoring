    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that is too large or complex: loc=89 (moderate size), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods / no cyclomatic complexity), nof=1 and fanin=0/fanout=0 (minimal state and coupling), lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion data). With no methods and no external dependencies, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient decomposition or would benefit from further modularization."
