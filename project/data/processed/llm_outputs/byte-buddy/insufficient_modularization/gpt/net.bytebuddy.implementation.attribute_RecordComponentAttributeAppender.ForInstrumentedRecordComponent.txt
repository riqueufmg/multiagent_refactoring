    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, simple class: LOC=23, number of fields (nof)=0, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, DIT=1, LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issues reported), fan-in=0, fan-out=0. Dependency list contains a single collaborator (AnnotationAppender). Given the very low size and complexity and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; thus Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
