    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OfDynamicInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of excessive size or complexity: LOC is 54, WMC is 0, and there are 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0). It has a small number of fields (nof=3) and no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependencies are limited. Given the small size, lack of methods to decompose, and low complexity/coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
