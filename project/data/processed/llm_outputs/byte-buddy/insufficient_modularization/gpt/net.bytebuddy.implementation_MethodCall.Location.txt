    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and low-complexity. Metrics show LOC=65, NOF=3, NOM=0, WMC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. These values indicate limited size, no method complexity or large number of methods, low coupling, and good cohesion. Dependency list contains only three items. There is no evidence from the provided metrics that the class has excessive responsibility or implementation complexity that would require further decomposition."
