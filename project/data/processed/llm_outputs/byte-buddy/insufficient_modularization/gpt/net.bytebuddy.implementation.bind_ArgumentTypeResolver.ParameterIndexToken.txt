    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC = 30, number of fields = 1, number of methods = 0 (nom = 0), WMC = 0. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, no dependencies). There is no evidence of high implementation complexity or size that would justify further decomposition. LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate poor cohesion given the absence of methods. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
