    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and non-complex: LOC = 11, WMC = 0, number of methods = 0, number of fields = 0. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and there are no meaningful dependencies beyond a listed dispatcher reference. Given its tiny size and lack of internal responsibilities, there is no evidence that it has not been sufficiently decomposed; further modularization is not warranted based on the provided metrics."
