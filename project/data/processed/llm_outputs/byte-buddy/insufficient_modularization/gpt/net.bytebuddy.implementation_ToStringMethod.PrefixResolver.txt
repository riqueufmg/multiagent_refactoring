    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that is large or complex enough to require further decomposition: LOC is 70 but there are 0 methods (nom=0) and WMC=0, only 1 field (nof=1), DIT=0, fanin=0 and fanout=0. LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion data) and a single external dependency. With no methods and no measured complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
