    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has relatively large size (loc = 127) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and zero WMC (wmc = 0), indicating a substantial amount of code not decomposed into methods. It also has 4 fields (nof = 4) but no measured external interactions (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and a shallow inheritance depth (dit = 1). The combination of high LOC with nom = 0 and low measured cohesion indicator (lcom = -1.0) suggests the implementation is monolithic and not modularized, so further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
