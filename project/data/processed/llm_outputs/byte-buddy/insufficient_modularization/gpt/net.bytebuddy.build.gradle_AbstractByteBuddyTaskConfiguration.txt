    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTaskConfiguration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an insufficiently modularized class: although the class has a moderate number of fields (nof=13), it has few methods (nom=3, nopm=1) and low complexity (wmc=5), moderate size (loc=164) and very high cohesion (lcom=0.0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating limited coupling. These factors suggest the class encapsulates a focused configuration role rather than being an undersplit, overly complex class, so there is no strong evidence for further decomposition."
