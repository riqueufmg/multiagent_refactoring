    "justification": "The class is very small and contains no measurable responsibilities: loc=10, nof=0, nom=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no fields or methods to decompose and complexity metrics are zero (lcom=-1.0 indicates no meaningful cohesion data). Given its minimal size and lack of implementation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
