    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, simple class: LOC=13, no fields (nof=0) and no methods recorded (nom=0), low complexity (WMC=0), no inheritance depth (DIT=0), negligible coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency), and LCOM indicates no cohesion problem. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or responsibility overload that would justify further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
