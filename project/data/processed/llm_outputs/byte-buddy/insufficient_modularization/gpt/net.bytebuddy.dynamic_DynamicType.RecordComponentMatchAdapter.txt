    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=56), no methods (nom=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0) imply limited internal responsibilities to split; coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only three external dependencies are listed. These elements suggest the class is already small/cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
