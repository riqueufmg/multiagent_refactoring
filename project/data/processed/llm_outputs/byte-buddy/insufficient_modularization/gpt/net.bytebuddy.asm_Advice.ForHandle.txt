    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class large or complex enough to require further decomposition: LOC = 96 (small), WMC = 0 and NOM = 0 (no method complexity or behavioral size to split), NOPF/NOPM = 0 (no polymorphic/method decomposition indicators). Although NOF = 10 shows multiple fields, the lack of methods (and low coupling: fanin = 0, fanout = 0) suggests a simple data holder rather than a monolithic class that should be decomposed. LCOM = -1.0 is not a usable cohesion signal here. The listed dependencies exist but are not sufficient evidence of excessive responsibility or size that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
