    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class: LOC = 60 (moderate size), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods/complexity captured), NOF = 0 and NOPF = 0 (no fields), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling evidence). Given the absence of internal complexity or size indicators that would benefit from further decomposition, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
