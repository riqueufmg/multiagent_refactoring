    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=19, wmc=0. It shows minimal coupling and usage: fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation]. Inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1) and cohesion metric does not indicate decomposition need (lcom=-1.0). No evidence of large size, high complexity, or high coupling that would justify further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
