    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.enumeration.EnumerationDescription.ForLoadedEnumeration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=46), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and only one field (nof=1), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription), and LCOM=-1 (no evidence of low cohesion). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and not a candidate for further decomposition."
