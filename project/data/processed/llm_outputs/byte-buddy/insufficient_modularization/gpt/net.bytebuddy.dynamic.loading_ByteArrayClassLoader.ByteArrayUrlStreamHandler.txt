    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: LOC is small (53), number of methods (NOM) = 0 and WMC = 0 indicate no method-level complexity, NOF = 2 (only two fields), fan-in = 0 and fan-out = 0 indicate minimal coupling, and there is only one listed dependency. There is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would justify further decomposition."
