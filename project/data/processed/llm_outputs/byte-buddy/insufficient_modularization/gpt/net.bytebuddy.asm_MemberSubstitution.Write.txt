    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Write",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No smell: the class shows no methods (nom=0) and no cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0), only three fields (nof=3), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and a cohesion indicator of -1.0 (suggesting cohesion). Although LOC=70, the absence of methods and complexity provides no evidence of an undecomposed, monolithic class that would benefit from further modularization."
