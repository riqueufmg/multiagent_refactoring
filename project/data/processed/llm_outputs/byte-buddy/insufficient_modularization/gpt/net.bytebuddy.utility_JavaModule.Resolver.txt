    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, non-complex class: LOC=11, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, FANOUT=0, FANIN=0. There are no methods or fields to decompose and coupling is minimal (single listed dependency). Given the tiny size and lack of internal complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
