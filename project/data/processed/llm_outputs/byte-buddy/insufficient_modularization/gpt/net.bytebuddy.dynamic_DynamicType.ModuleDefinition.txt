    "justification": "High size: LOC = 524 indicates a large implementation that is a candidate for further decomposition. Limited external collaboration: only 3 listed dependencies, suggesting much functionality is concentrated inside this class rather than delegated. Other metrics do not refute the smell (nom=0, wmc=0, lcom=-1.0 are not providing cohesion/method counts), so the dominant evidence is the large LOC which justifies flagging Insufficient Modularization."
