    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=34, number of fields (nof)=2, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0. Low coupling and dependencies: fanout=0, fanin=0, single listed dependency (TypeList). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and does not show evidence of being insufficiently modularized or requiring further decomposition."
