    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small size (loc=54), no methods (nom=0) and WMC=0 (no internal complexity), only one field (nof=1), zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0), and LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion problem reported). These elements show the class is small and simple and does not exhibit the size or complexity that would justify further decomposition."
