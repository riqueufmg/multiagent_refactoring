    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=22, number of fields (nof)=1, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There is no measurable internal complexity or multiple responsibilities to decompose, and only a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
