    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddy_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: extremely high number of fields (nof = 263) while having a relatively small set of methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) and only 276 LOC — the large field count indicates the class packs many responsibilities/data and could be split into smaller classes. The weighted methods complexity is also high (wmc = 42), suggesting internal implementation complexity that would benefit from decomposition. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, so the complexity is concentrated inside this class rather than distributed. Although LCOM = 0.0 suggests internal cohesion, the disproportionate field count combined with elevated WMC justifies refactoring into multiple modules/components to reduce size and complexity."
