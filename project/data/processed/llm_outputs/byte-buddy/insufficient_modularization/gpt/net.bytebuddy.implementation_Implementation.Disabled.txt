    "justification": "Class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc = 84) while having no reported methods or fields (nof = 0, nom = 0) which suggests a concentrated implementation block; multiple external dependencies (6 listed: net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion) indicating it touches several responsibilities; and an LCOM value of -1.0 (indicating cohesion is not positively established). Taken in isolation, these elements suggest the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
