    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Size and dependency surface indicate insufficient modularization: the class has 154 LOC (loc = 154), which is large enough to warrant decomposition. It depends on multiple distinct type families (RecordComponentDescription, MethodDescription, TypeList, FieldDescription), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The cohesion metric is reported as LCOM = -1.0, indicating a cohesion concern or an unreliable / problematic cohesion measurement that supports further inspection. Given the combination of non-trivial size and dependencies across several domains, the class is a candidate for decomposition to improve modularity."
