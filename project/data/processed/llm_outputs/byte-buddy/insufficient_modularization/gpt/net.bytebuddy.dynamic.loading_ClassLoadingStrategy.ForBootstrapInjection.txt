    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy.ForBootstrapInjection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=29, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=2. Low complexity and responsibility: WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0 (indicating cohesion). Low coupling: fanout=0, fanin=0, DIT=1. Given the minimal size, lack of methods/behavior, low complexity and cohesion, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
