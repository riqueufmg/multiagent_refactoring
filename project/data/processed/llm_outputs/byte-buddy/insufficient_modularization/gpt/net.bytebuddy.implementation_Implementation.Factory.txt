{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "False — the class shows no evidence of being insufficiently modular in isolation: small size (loc=47), no methods (nom=0) and no weighted complexity (wmc=0), only 1 field (nof=1), low coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0) and limited dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to justify further decomposition."
