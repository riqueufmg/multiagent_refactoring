    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: very low number of fields (nof=1) and methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (dit=0) and only two dependencies. Although LOC=65, the absence of methods/complexity and minimal coupling suggest the class is not a large, complex unit that requires further decomposition."
