    "detection": false,
    "justification": "False - available metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. LOC = 98 (moderate size), NOF = 4 (small number of fields), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no method-level complexity or multiple responsibilities), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling evidence), LCOM = -1.0 (cohesion not applicable/no instance methods). With no methods, low coupling, and a small number of fields, there is no metric-based evidence in isolation that the class needs further decomposition."
