    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.MethodSizeHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 333) while exposing many features/attributes (nof = 11), which suggests multiple responsibilities concentrated in one class. The metrics show no measured methods (nom = 0) and low measured complexity (wmc = 0) but these do not mitigate the large size; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 indicate the implementation is self-contained rather than delegated. Together, the high LOC and relatively high number of fields imply the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
