    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class has no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), very low size (loc=26) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). In isolation there is nothing large or complex to decompose, so it is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization."
