    "justification": "Class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=41), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero measured complexity (WMC=0). Coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no evidence of high cohesion problems (LCOM=-1.0 indicates not applicable/insufficient data). Although it has 4 fields (NOF=4), overall metrics show neither large implementation size nor high complexity that would justify further decomposition."
