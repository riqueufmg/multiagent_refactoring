    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.specimen.ExampleClass",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class concentrates substantial implementation in a single unit: number of methods nom=18 (nopm=18), lines of code loc=167 and weighted method complexity wmc=18. These values indicate multiple responsibilities and non-trivial size/complexity that could be reduced by further decomposition. The cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) is ambiguous here and does not negate the high method count and LOC. fanin=0 and fanout=0 show the class is isolated, but that isolation does not alleviate the internal size/complexity, so the class likely suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
