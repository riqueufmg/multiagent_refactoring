    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and not complex in isolation. Metrics show LOC=49, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method complexity (wmc)=0, coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). There are no internal methods or high complexity indicators to justify further decomposition. Dependencies are limited and do not imply internal size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
