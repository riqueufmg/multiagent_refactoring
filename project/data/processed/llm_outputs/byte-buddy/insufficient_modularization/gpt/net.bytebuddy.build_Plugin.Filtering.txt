    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: although LOC = 111, the class has no methods (nom = 0) and zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 0). It contains only a small number of fields (nof = 4), shows high cohesion (lcom = -1.0), and has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given these elements, there is no evidence in isolation that the class holds multiple responsibilities or excessive implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
