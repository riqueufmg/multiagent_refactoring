    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: loc=76 (moderate size), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no method complexity), nof=3 (few fields), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). Dependencies are limited. Overall size, complexity and cohesion metrics do not justify marking this class as insufficiently modularized."
