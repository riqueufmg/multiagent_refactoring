    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no internal implementation to decompose: LOC=14, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0. Coupling and usage indicators are absent (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]), and cohesion metric is not meaningful (LCOM=-1.0) because there are no methods. These metrics indicate there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further modularization."
