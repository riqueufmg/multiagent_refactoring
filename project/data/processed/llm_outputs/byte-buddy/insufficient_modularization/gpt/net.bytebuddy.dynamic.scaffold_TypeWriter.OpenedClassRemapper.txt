    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.OpenedClassRemapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and simple: LOC=13, WMC=0, no fields or methods recorded (nof=0, nom=0, nopm=0), LCOM negative/undefined, fanin=0 and fanout=0. It has a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader) but no measurable internal complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition. Based on these values, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
