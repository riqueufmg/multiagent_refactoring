    "justification": "Class has very small size and trivial structure: loc=31, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), nof=2 (only two fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it is large or complex enough to require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
