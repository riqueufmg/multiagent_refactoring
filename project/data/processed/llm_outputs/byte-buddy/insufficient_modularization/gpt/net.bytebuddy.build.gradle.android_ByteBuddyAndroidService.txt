    "justification": "Class is likely insufficiently modularized: very large size (loc = 292) with few methods (nom = 5, nopm = 4) indicates large, monolithic methods; high complexity (wmc = 26) concentrated in a small number of routines; extensive external dependencies (multiple ByteBuddy, build and instrumentation types) suggesting the class handles multiple responsibilities. These elements together indicate the class should be decomposed into smaller classes or helper components to reduce size and complexity."
