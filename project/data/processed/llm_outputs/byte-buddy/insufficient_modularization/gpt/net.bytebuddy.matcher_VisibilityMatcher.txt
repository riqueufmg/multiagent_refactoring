    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. Metrics show small size and low complexity: LOC=26, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOF=1, NOPM=2, LCOM=0.0, DIT=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. The class is cohesive (LCOM=0.0), contains only a few methods and a single field, and has minimal dependencies. There is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
