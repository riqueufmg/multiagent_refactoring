    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size and likely undecomposed responsibilities: loc=378 indicates a large implementation; nof=17 (many fields) combined with nom=0 (no methods recorded) suggests a large, data- or responsibility-heavy class that has not been split into smaller units. Presence of multiple distinct dependencies (AnnotationList, JavaDispatcher, RecordComponentDescription, build plugins) indicates the class touches multiple concerns. These elements together point to Insufficient Modularization."
