    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: LOC=67 (moderate size) but complexity and member counts are absent or zero (WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPM=0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, and DIT=2 alone does not imply poor modularization. LCOM=-1.0 suggests the cohesion metric is unavailable. Given the lack of methods/fields and no evidence of high complexity or multiple responsibilities, there is insufficient evidence to detect Insufficient Modularization."
