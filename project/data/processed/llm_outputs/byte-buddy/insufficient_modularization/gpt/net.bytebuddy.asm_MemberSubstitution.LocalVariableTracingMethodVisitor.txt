    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, low-complexity class: LOC=21, WMC=0, NOM=0, no fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single external dependency. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or multiple responsibilities that would indicate it needs further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
