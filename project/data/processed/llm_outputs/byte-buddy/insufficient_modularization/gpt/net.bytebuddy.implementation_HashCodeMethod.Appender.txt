    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and low-complexity (loc=74, wmc=0), has a limited number of fields (nof=5) and no measured methods (nom=0), low inheritance depth (dit=1), and exhibits high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although a few external types are referenced, the provided metrics do not indicate a large, multi-responsibility class that would benefit from further decomposition."
