    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=58, NOM=0, WMC=0, no public methods (nopm=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or high implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. Dependencies are limited, and cohesion metrics do not indicate fragmentation. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
