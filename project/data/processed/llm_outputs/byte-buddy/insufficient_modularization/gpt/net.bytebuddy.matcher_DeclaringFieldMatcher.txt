    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOF=1, LCOM=0.0. Low complexity (WMC=3), few methods (3) and single field indicate it is already well-scoped; fanin/fanout=0 show no coupling pressure requiring decomposition. These metrics do not support insufficient modularization."
