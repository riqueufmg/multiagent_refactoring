    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=17, WMC=0, NOM=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited to two method-related types. LCOM=-1 (no cohesion concern reported). Given the low size, zero reported methods/complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
