    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkJavassist_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large number of fields (nof = 263) and substantial size (loc = 276) indicate a bloated single unit; relatively high overall complexity (wmc = 42) across its methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) suggests concentration of behavior rather than separation; there is no internal decomposition via nested classes (nc = 0) nor inheritance (dit = 0) to distribute responsibilities, and zero fanin/fanout (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) indicates the class is self-contained and likely monolithic. These elements together justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
