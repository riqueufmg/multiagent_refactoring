    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.PersistenceHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc=222) while exposing a substantial amount of state (nof=10) but declaring no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). This combination indicates a concentrated implementation with significant content and state without clear modular boundaries. The absence of methods prevents natural decomposition points inside the class, and the high LOC suggests multiple responsibilities or complex initialization that could be split. The presence of multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) further implies the class interacts with varied concerns that could be modularized. These elements (loc, nof, nom, and listed dependencies) justify that the class exhibits Insufficient Modularization and would likely benefit from decomposition."
