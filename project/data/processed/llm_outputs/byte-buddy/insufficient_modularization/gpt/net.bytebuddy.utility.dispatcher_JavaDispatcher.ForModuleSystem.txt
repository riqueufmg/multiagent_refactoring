    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=51), very low complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0) and only 4 fields (nof=4) indicating limited internal responsibilities, low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single listed dependency, and a negative LCOM (-1.0) which does not indicate poor cohesion. These metrics do not justify further decomposition."
