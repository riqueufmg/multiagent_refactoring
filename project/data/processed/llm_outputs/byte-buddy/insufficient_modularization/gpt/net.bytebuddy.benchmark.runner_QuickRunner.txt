    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.runner.QuickRunner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=23, NOM=2, WMC=2, NOF=1. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no external dependencies. Although LCOM=1.0 suggests methods do not share state, the overall size and low complexity indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition; no metrics show high complexity or large size that would justify marking Insufficient Modularization."
