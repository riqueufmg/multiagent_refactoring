    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: LOC is only 52 (small size), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods/low complexity to decompose), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (low coupling), and dependencies are minimal. LCOM = -1.0 appears to reflect no-method/no-field cohesion state rather than poor cohesion. There is no metric evidence (large LOC, many methods, high complexity or high coupling) to justify further decomposition."
