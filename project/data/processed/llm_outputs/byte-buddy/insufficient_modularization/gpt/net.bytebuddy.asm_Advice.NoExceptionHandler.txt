    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.NoExceptionHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=19, no methods (nom=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0). It has only 2 fields (nof=2), minimal external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single listed dependency. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not show signs that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
