    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForUnusedValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=41, no methods (nom=0), single field (nof=1), and WMC=0 indicating negligible implementation complexity. Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=0). Given these metrics and the limited dependencies, there is no evidence that the class has grown large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition."
