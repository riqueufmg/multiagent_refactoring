    "justification": "Class has small size and minimal internal complexity: loc=25, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0. There are no methods to decompose (nom=0) and low coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0). The metrics indicate a trivial, cohesive unit rather than a large class that should be split, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
