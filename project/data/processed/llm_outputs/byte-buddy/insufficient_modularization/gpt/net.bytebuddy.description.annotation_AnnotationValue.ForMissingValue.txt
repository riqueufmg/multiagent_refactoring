    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has a relatively large size (loc=101) while exposing no methods (nom=0) and only a few fields (nof=4), indicating substantial code in a single unit without method-level decomposition. wmc=0 and fanin=0/fanout=0 show low measured complexity but do not explain the large LOC; the class also depends on multiple concepts (TypeDescription, AnnotationValue, MethodDescription), which suggests it may be shouldering multiple responsibilities. These elements together point to Insufficient Modularization: the class can likely be decomposed to reduce size and improve modular structure."
