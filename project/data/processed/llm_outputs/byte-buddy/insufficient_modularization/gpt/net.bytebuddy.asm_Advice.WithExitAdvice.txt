    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithExitAdvice",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc: 254) while containing multiple fields (nof: 4) but no recorded methods (nom: 0, nopm: 0) and no measured complexity (wmc: 0). The large LOC combined with non-trivial state (fields) and absence of method-level decomposition indicates code and responsibility concentration. Fanin and fanout are 0, so the class is isolated rather than delegating behavior, which does not mitigate its size. Based on these elements (loc=254, nof=4, nom=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) the class appears insufficiently modularized and is a candidate for decomposition."
