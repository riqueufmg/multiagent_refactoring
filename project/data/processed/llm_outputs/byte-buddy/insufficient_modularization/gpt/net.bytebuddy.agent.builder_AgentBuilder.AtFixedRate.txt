    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.AtFixedRate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=40), very low complexity (WMC=0), no methods (nom=0), few fields (NOF=3, NOPF=0), high cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0), and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Only a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Based on these metrics in isolation, the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
