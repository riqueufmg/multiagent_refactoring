    "justification": "False — the class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. Metrics show small size and complexity: LOC=29, number of fields=2, number of methods=0 (nom=0), WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. Dependency list is short. Considered in isolation, it is neither large nor complex and does not require further decomposition."
