    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, low-complexity class: LOC=18, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) and only a few external dependencies are listed. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or many responsibilities that would indicate the need for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
