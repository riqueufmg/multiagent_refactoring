    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=36, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), very low complexity (wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two lightweight dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not exhibit signs that it needs further decomposition."
