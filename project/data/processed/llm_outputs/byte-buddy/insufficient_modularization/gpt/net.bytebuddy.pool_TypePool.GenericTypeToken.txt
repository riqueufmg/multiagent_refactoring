    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 1711) and contains a high number of features/fields (nof = 96), which indicates a concentrated amount of code and state in a single class; it also depends on many distinct types (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool), suggesting multiple responsibilities. The combination of very high LOC and many features without clear decomposition supports the detection of Insufficient Modularization (the class should be split into smaller, focused components)."
