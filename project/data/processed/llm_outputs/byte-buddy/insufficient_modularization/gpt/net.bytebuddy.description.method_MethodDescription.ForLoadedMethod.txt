    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a non-trivial size (loc = 137) while depending on multiple, distinct concerns: annotation handling (AnnotationValue, AnnotationList, AnnotationDescription), parameter modelling (ParameterDescription, ParameterList), type modelling (TypeList, TypeDescription), method description (MethodDescription) and caching (net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin). This breadth of dependencies suggests the class is handling several responsibilities and could be decomposed to improve modularity. Although some metrics (wmc = 0, fanin/fanout = 0, lcom = -1.0) are not informative or not computed, the combination of moderate LOC and diverse dependency set justifies flagging Insufficient Modularization."
