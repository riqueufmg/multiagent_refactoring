    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidService.ConfigurationAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=22), no methods (nom=0) and minimal state (nof=1), zero complexity (wmc=0), no internal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. Given these metrics the class is already minimal and contains no complex responsibilities that would indicate a need for further decomposition."
