    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (LOC=47), no methods (nom=0) and WMC=0, only one field (nof=1), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single external dependency. In isolation there are no multiple responsibilities or internal complexity that would justify further decomposition."
