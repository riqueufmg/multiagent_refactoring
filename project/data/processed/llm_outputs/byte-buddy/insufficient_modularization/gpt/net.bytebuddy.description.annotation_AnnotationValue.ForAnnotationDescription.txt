    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: although LOC = 122 is moderate, the class has only nof = 2 fields, nom = 0 methods, wmc = 0, fanin = 0 and fanout = 0, suggesting low internal complexity and low coupling. LCOM = -1.0 appears invalid/uncomputed. Given the small number of fields/methods and lack of complexity or coupling evidence, there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization."
