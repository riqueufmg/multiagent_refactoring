    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=39), no methods (nom=0) and very low complexity (wmc=0), a single field (nof=1), and no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no internal complexity or large number of responsibilities that would justify further decomposition; dependencies are limited and do not indicate internal entanglement. Therefore, do not detect Insufficient Modularization."
