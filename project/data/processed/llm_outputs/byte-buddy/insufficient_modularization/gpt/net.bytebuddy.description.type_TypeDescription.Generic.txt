    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Generic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (LOC = 5738), a very high number of fields (NOF = 132) but only 1 public field (NOPF = 1) suggesting many internal responsibilities, and many external dependencies (21 listed) indicating broad coupling. These factors (large LOC + high field count + many dependencies) justify that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and is a candidate for further modularization."
