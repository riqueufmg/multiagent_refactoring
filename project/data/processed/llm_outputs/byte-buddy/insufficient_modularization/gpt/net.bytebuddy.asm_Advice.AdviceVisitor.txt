    "justification": "Class is a likely case of Insufficient Modularization: it has very large size (loc = 428) indicating many lines of implementation that could be split; it declares a relatively high number of fields (nof = 13) which suggests multiple responsibilities or state groups; it depends on several distinct external concepts (dependencies include net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize) which indicates the class touches multiple domain concerns and could be decomposed by responsibility; inheritance depth is shallow (dit = 1) so behavior is concentrated in this class rather than distributed through subclasses. These elements together justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
