    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.Transformer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 110) while exposing no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0) and only a few fields (nof = 3). This combination indicates substantive implementation content without method-level decomposition. Additional indicators: lcom = -1.0 (no meaningful cohesion metrics due to lack of methods) and fanin/fanout = 0 (no detected external interactions) — all consistent with a class that carries too much undivided implementation. Therefore the class shows Insufficient Modularization: it has not been decomposed into smaller methods/classes and could be split to reduce size and complexity."
