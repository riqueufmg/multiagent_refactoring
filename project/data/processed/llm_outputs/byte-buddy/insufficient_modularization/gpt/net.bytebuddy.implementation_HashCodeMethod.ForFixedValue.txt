    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=22, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0. Low coupling and interaction: fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Depth and complexity are minimal (dit=0, nc=0) and cohesion metric not indicating fragmented responsibilities (lcom=-1.0). These factors indicate the class is already highly modular and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
