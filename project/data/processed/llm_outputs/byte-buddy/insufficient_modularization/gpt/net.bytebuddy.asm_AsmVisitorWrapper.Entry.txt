    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.Entry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=37), has no methods (nom=0) and low implementation complexity (wmc=0). It has only two fields (nof=2), minimal inheritance depth (dit=1), and no coupling/significant dependencies indicated by fanin=0 and fanout=0. Cohesion metric does not indicate fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
