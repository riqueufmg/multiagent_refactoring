    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc = 69), no methods (nom = 0) and very low complexity (wmc = 0), few fields (nof = 3), minimal coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only two listed dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is small and simple in isolation, so further decomposition is not indicated."
