    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.Dynamic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely instance of Insufficient Modularization because its size is very large (loc = 408) while exposing almost no behavioral decomposition (nom = 0, nopm = 0). It holds several fields (nof = 5, nopf = 1) and depends on many distinct types (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, TypeList, FieldDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, EnumerationDescription, JavaType), indicating multiple responsibilities and cross-cutting concerns that could be separated. The combination of high LOC and low method count strongly suggests the class has not been adequately decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
