    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Analyzed in isolation: the class is very small (loc=18), has no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies are listed. LCOM=-1.0 provides no evidence of cohesion problems. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and provide no support for Insufficient Modularization."
