    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 450) with a high number of fields (nof = 38) while exposing only a few methods (nom = 3, wmc = 3). The file also references multiple nested/auxiliary types (TypeProxy.Default, TypeProxy.SilentConstruction, TypeProxy.AbstractMethodErrorThrow, TypeProxy.InvocationFactory), indicating the class contains several distinct responsibilities/implementations bundled together. Although cohesion appears high (lcom = 0.0) and method complexity is low, the substantial size and multiplicity of inner types and fields suggest the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization to reduce size and separate concerns."
