    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.ClassWriterStrategy.FrameComputingClassWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has low size and complexity: LOC=23, WMC=0, no methods/fields reported (nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter). LCOM value is not indicative (-1.0). Given the small LOC and zero complexity/coupling metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or that it should be decomposed further."
