    "justification": "The class does not exhibit typical signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=72), low complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0) and only three fields (nof=3). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited. These metrics do not indicate that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
