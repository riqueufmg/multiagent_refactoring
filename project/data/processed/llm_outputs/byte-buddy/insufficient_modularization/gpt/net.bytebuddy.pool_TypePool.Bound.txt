    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=23, number of fields=1, methods=0, WMC=0. Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). No inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no children (NC=0). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and does not show signs that it needs further decomposition."
