    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader.JdkClassReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: zero methods (nom=0) and zero fields (nof=0) indicate no large concentrated implementation, low size (loc=49), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) does not indicate internal monolithic responsibilities. Based on these metrics taken in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
