    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=42), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is simple and does not require further decomposition."
