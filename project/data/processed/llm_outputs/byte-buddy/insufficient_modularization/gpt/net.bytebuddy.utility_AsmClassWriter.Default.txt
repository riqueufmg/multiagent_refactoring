    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Insufficient modularization not detected. Although the class has a moderate size (loc = 226), the available metrics show no signs of internal complexity or decomposition need: WMC = 0, NOM = 0, NOF = 3, fan-in = 0, fan-out = 0. LCOM is not available (-1.0). The class has few fields, no recorded methods, and no coupling/fan-out evidence suggesting a single large cohesion-violating unit. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is insufficient evidence to claim the class should be further decomposed."
