    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Dispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is large (loc = 201) while exposing many fields (nof = 9) but no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0), indicating substantial implementation/data colocated rather than decomposed into smaller responsibilities. Its dependency set (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication) spans multiple concerns, reinforcing that the class likely combines responsibilities that could be split into smaller, more focused modules."
