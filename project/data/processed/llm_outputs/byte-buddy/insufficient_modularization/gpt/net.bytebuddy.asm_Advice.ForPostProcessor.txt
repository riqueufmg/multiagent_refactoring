    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForPostProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=11), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nopf=0), low complexity (WMC=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
