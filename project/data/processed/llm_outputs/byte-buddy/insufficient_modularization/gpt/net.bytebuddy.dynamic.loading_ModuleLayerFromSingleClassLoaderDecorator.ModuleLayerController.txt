    "justification": "Class is very small and lacks internal complexity or responsibilities that would indicate incomplete decomposition: LOC = 11, number of methods = 0, WMC = 0, no fields (nof = 0), no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only one external dependency. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
