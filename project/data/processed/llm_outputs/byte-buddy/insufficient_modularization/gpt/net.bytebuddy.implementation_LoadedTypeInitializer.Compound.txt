    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class size and complexity are low: LOC=54 and WMC=0. It defines no methods (nom=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2), indicating limited responsibilities. Cohesion metric is high (LCOM=-1.0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single external dependency is listed. Given these metrics, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modular or requires further decomposition."
