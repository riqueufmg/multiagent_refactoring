    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition. The class is small (loc=42) with a modest number of methods (nom=7) and moderate complexity (wmc=7). Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.4286), and there are no incoming or outgoing coupling concerns (fanin=0, fanout=0) beyond a single dependency on ByteBuddyJarTask. Depth of inheritance is shallow (dit=1) and there are no subclasses (nc=0). Given the low size, limited complexity, and reasonable cohesion, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
