    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=25, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1. Coupling and reuse are low (fanin=0, fanout=0, DIT=0). There are no methods to decompose (NOM=0) and implementation complexity is minimal, so there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed."
