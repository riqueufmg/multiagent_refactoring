    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaMetafactoryFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a very large size (loc = 526) while showing few structural division metrics (nom = 0, nof = 4). A single large LOC value indicates the class likely contains multiple responsibilities or a large internal implementation that has not been decomposed. Low/flat inheritance (dit = 1) and a non-positive cohesion indicator (lcom = -1.0) further suggest poor internal modularization. Given these measurements, further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
