    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: small size (LOC=66), no methods reported (nom=0, wmc=0), low field count (nof=3), shallow inheritance (DIT=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no evidence of high complexity or low cohesion (LCOM not indicating fragmentation). These values suggest the class is not insufficiently modularized in isolation."
