    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.IntegerConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is relatively large and complex (loc=155, wmc=14) while containing a small set of responsibilities (nom=5, nopm=4, nof=5). Its cohesion is only moderate (lcom=0.6), suggesting multiple responsibilities or mixed concerns within the same class. It has no subclasses (nc=0) and zero fan-in/fan-out, indicating logic is concentrated in this class rather than distributed. The dependency list (StackManipulation, StackSize, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation) indicates it handles both bytecode constant behavior and auxiliary concerns (equality/hash, stack sizing). Together these metrics support that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
