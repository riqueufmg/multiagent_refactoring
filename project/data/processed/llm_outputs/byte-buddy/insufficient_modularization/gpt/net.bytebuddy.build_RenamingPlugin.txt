    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RenamingPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has 208 LOC with 9 methods (nom=9) and 7 fields (nof=7), indicating substantial implementation within a single class. Cohesion is moderate-to-low (lcom=0.5555555555555556 > 0.5), suggesting multiple responsibilities that are not well grouped. Complexity is non-trivial (wmc=9) and the class depends on many distinct concerns (e.g., net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, type/field/method description types, matchers, dynamic type and class file locator APIs), which implies it coordinates varied functionality. These elements together justify that further decomposition could reduce size and complexity and improve cohesion."
