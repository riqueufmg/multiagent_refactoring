    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC is 59 (moderate size), number of fields (nof) is 3, number of methods (nom) is 0 and weighted method count (wmc) is 0, indicating low implementation complexity. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 (no coupling evidence requiring decomposition). Only three external type dependencies are listed. Given the small-to-moderate size, minimal complexity, and lack of behavioral content, there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
