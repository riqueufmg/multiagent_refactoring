    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayFactory.ForReferenceType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (loc = 29), no methods (nom = 0) and zero complexity (wmc = 0), a single field (nof = 1), and no measured coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). The LCOM value (-1.0) is likely not applicable given the absence of methods. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not present evidence that it needs further decomposition."
