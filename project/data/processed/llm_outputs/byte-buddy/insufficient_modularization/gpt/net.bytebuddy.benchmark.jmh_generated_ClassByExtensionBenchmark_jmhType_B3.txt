    "justification": "High number of fields (nof=256) indicates many responsibilities/data elements concentrated in a single class; zero methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0) imply behaviour is not modularized into separate methods/classes; small LOC (loc=18) combined with very large field count shows a disproportionate internal structure that suggests lack of decomposition; inheritance depth (dit=3) increases conceptual complexity that would benefit from splitting responsibilities; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate no evident external modularization to compensate. These elements together point to Insufficient Modularization."
