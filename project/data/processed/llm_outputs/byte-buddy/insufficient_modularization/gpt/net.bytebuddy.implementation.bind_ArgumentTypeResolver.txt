    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.ArgumentTypeResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has large size (loc = 203) while exposing very few methods (nom = 3) which implies very large method bodies rather than a finer-grained decomposition; high complexity (wmc = 15) concentrated in a small number of methods increases maintenance risk; low cohesion (lcom = 0.6666666666666666) indicates the methods do not strongly relate to a single focused responsibility; only one public method (nopm = 1) with many lines suggests internal implementation is monolithic. Together these metrics justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
