    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.EntryPoint",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: low method count (nom = 2) and low weighted method count (wmc = 2) indicate simple behavior; small number of fields (nof = 2); moderate size (loc = 127) but not accompanied by high complexity; very high cohesion (lcom = -1.0) and no external coupling indicated by fanin = 0 and fanout = 0. These metrics together suggest the class is adequately modular and does not require further decomposition."
