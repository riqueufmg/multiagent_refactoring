    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, behavior-rich class: 0 methods (nom=0), WMC=0 and fanin=0/fanout=0 show negligible behavioral complexity and coupling. The class has 5 fields (nof=5) and LOC=85, but with no methods or computed cohesion (lcom=-1.0) there is no evidence of mixed responsibilities or high implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
