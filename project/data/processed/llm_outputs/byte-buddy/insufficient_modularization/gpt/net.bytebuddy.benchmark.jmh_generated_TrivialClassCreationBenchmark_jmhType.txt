    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is minimal and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: LOC = 2, number of fields (nof) = 0, number of methods (nom) = 0, WMC = 0, fan-in = 0, fan-out = 0, and no dependencies. These values show no sizable implementation or complexity to decompose. Although DIT = 4, the class has no members or behavior to refactor, and LCOM is non-applicable (-1), so there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
