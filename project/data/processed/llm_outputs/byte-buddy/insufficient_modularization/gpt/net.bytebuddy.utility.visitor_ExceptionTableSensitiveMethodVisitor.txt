    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor.ExceptionTableSensitiveMethodVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 35) and many public methods (nopm = 16) indicate a large interface and multiple responsibilities; high complexity (wmc = 36) and sizable implementation (loc = 237) increase maintenance/understanding cost. The class has very few fields (nof = 1) while containing many methods, suggesting behavior-heavy implementation that could be split into smaller, focused classes or helpers. These metrics collectively point to a class that would likely benefit from further decomposition."
