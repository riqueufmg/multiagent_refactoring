    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, non-complex class: LOC=11, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=0 (no fields), WMC=0, DIT=1, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There is no evidence of high size, high complexity, or many responsibilities that would indicate it needs further decomposition. Based on these isolated metrics and zero dependencies, Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
