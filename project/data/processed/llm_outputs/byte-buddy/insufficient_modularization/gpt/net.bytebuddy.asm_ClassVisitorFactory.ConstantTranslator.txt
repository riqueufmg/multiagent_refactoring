    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.ConstantTranslator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a moderate size (loc=93) while declaring a non-trivial number of fields (nof=7) but no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). This combination indicates state and likely multiple responsibilities packed into a single class rather than behaviorally decomposed units. The low inheritance depth (dit=1) and zero external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) imply the class is self-contained and a good candidate for splitting internal concerns. The presence of external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) further suggests mixed responsibilities that could be separated. Taken together, these metrics point to insufficient modularization and justify decomposing the class to reduce size and implementation complexity."
