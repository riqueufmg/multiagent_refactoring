    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveBoxingDelegate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is relatively large (loc=130) while exposing only a small number of methods (nom=3, nopm=2) but carrying several fields (nof=5). Its cyclomatic/maintenance complexity is elevated (wmc=11) given the low method count, yielding complex, likely multi-responsibility methods. Cohesion is low (lcom=0.6666666666666666), indicating that methods/fields are not tightly related. Taken in isolation, these metrics (high LOC and WMC, multiple fields, few methods, and low cohesion) justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
