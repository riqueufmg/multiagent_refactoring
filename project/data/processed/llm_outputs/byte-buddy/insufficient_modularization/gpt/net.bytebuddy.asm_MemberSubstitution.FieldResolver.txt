    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a moderate size (loc=81) but reports zero methods (nom=0, wmc=0) while holding three fields (nof=3). This mismatch (non-trivial lines of code without decomposed behavior) and the use of multiple external types (5 dependencies: TypeList, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, FieldDescription, TypeDescription, ElementMatcher) indicate it likely contains mixed or procedural logic that is not modularized into methods/helpers. These factors (LOC >> 0 with nom=0, multiple dependencies) justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
