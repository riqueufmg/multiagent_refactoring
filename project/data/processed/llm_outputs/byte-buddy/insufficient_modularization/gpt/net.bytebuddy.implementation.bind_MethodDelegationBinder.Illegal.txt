    "justification": "The class does not show characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=32), has no methods (nom=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0), and exhibits no coupling pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is only a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). These metrics indicate low size and low complexity with no evidence of multiple responsibilities or need for further decomposition."
