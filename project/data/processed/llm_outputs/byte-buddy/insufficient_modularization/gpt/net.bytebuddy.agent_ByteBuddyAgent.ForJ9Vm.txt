    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.ForJ9Vm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and low-complexity: LOC=13, NOF=0, NOM=0, WMC=0. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no listed dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 indicates the cohesion metric is not applicable here. Given the absence of methods/fields, minimal size, and zero coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
