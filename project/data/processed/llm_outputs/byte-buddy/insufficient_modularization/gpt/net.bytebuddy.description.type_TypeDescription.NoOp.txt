    "justification": "Metrics show no internal decomposition opportunities: nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0 and wmc=0 indicate the class has no methods or fields and zero cyclomatic complexity. loc=85 is moderate but without methods/fields there is nothing to further modularize. fanin=0 and fanout=0 imply no internal coupling to split, and the only listed dependency is AnnotationList. LCOM=-1.0 appears to be not applicable. Therefore, there is no evidence of an undecomposed large/complex class in isolation."
