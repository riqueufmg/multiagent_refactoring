    "justification": "Class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc = 56), no methods or fields reported (nom = 0, nof = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), minimal coupling (fanout = 0, single dependency on net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription), and no fanin. These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
