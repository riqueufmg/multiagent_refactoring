    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMatchedDynamicInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: it has zero methods (nom = 0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc = 0), only 4 fields (nof = 4) and a modest size (loc = 67). Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and listed dependencies are few. These metrics indicate no concentrated implementation complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition when the class is considered in isolation."
