    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: loc=40, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Low coupling: fanin=0, fanout=0 and only one listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of a large, complex, or multifunctional class that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
