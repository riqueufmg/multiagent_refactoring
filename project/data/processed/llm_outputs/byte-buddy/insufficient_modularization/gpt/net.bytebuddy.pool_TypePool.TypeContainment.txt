    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.TypeContainment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc=164) while exposing a small set of fields (nof=5) and no methods (nom=0), suggesting a monolithic implementation that could be split. Low/undefined cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0) are inconsistent with the class size, indicating organization issues rather than simple, cohesive responsibilities. The class also depends on multiple external types (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription), implying it touches multiple concerns. Together these elements point to Insufficient Modularization and recommend further decomposition."
