    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely case of insufficient modularization because it is large (loc = 306) while carrying many fields (nof = 15), indicating high internal size/state that can be split; it depends on many diverse concerns (ParameterDescription, FieldDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, AnnotationDescription, Assigner, FieldLocator, multiple bytecode manipulation types such as Addition, Removal, StackManipulation, Duplication) which suggests it mixes responsibilities (type/field/method description, annotation handling, bytecode generation, field locating/assignment); method-related metrics (nom = 0, nopm = 0) combined with high LOC imply complexity is not isolated into small cohesive methods or components. These elements together justify further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
