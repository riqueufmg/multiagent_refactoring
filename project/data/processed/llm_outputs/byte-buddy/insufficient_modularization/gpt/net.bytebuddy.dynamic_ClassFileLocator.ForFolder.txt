    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: though LOC is 105, the class has no methods (nom=0), no public fields (nopf=0), only one field (nof=1), and zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0). Coupled with zero fan-in/fan-out and only two listed dependencies, there is no evidence of high internal complexity or many responsibilities that would justify further decomposition."
