    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForReturnValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a non-trivial size (loc = 92) combined with a relatively large number of fields (nof = 5) while declaring no methods (nom = 0). It also references multiple external types (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription), which suggests it touches multiple concerns. The mix of moderate LOC, several fields, zero methods, and multiple dependencies indicates low internal decomposition and a likely opportunity to split responsibilities into smaller, more focused classes (insufficient modularization)."
