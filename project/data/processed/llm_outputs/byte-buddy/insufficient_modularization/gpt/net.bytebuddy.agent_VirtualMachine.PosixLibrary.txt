    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.PosixLibrary",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class defines a relatively large amount of state (nof=9) and occupies moderate size (loc=111) while declaring no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating it is a bulky data holder. It exposes multiple public fields (nopf=3), suggesting weak encapsulation and likely multiple responsibilities grouped together. The cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0) together with zero fan-in/fan-out supports that the class is isolated but not well decomposed. These elements point to insufficient modularization and a candidate for decomposition into smaller, more cohesive units."
