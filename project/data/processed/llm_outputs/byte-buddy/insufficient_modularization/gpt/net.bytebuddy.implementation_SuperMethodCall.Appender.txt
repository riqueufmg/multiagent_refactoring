    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has small size and low complexity indicators: LOC=59, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=2, DIT=1, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. These metrics show no accumulation of methods or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition; coupling and responsibility appear minimal, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected for this class in isolation."
