    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: a very large size (loc = 437) combined with very few methods (nom = 3) indicates large/long methods that likely bundle multiple responsibilities and should be decomposed. The class holds many fields (nof = 12) relative to its small method count, suggesting a high data footprint within a single class. Although cyclomatic complexity is low (wmc = 3), that likely reflects few large methods rather than well-factored behavior. The presence of multiple nested/related types in the dependencies (RecordComponentDescription.InDefinedShape, RecordComponentDescription.RecordComponent, RecordComponentDescription.Token) further suggests several roles or responsibilities are implemented together in this file instead of being separated. These elements (loc=437, nom=3, nof=12, nested types listed) justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
