    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class: LOC = 111 (moderate size), WMC = 11 (moderate complexity), NOM = 8 and NOPM = 8 (limited number of methods/public API), NOF = 5 (manageable fields). Cohesion is high (LCOM = 0.25) and there is no inheritance or children (DIT = 0, NC = 0) and no coupling shown (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These factors suggest the class is reasonably cohesive and not overly large or complex, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
