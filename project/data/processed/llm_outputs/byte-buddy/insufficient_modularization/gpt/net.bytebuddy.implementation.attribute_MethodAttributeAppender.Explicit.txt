    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender.Explicit",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively large size (loc = 131) while exposing no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and only a few fields (nof = 3). A large LOC with zero methods indicates substantial implementation concentrated in a single, undecomposed unit (e.g., long initializer, inline logic or many nested constructs) that could be split into smaller methods or helper classes. Although cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) does not indicate low cohesion, the combination of high LOC and absence of methods (and zero measured complexity per-method, wmc = 0) strongly suggests the class has not been decomposed into modular responsibilities and would benefit from further decomposition. Dependencies on multiple collaborators (AnnotationAppender, MethodAttributeAppender, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) further imply mixed responsibilities that could be separated."
