    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=22, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM is not indicating cohesion problems (LCOM=-1.0 likely not applicable). Given the low size, zero method complexity, and lack of dependencies, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or requires further decomposition."
