    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=1185), high implementation complexity (wmc=47), many fields (nof=35) and many methods (nom=28). It also contains or depends on a large number of inner/related types (AttachmentProvider, AgentProvider, Attacher, Simple, Disabled, ForUserDefinedToolsJar, ProcessProvider, ExternalAttachment, ForEmulatedAttachment, Accessor, Unavailable, AttachmentTypeEvaluator, ForModularizedVm, InstallationAction, ForCurrentVm, ForStandardToolsJarVm, ForLegacyVm, Installer, ForJ9Vm, ForByteBuddyAgent) indicating multiple responsibilities bundled into a single class. Although LCOM is low (0.1429) indicating cohesion, the class size, complexity and large set of nested/provider types strongly suggest it has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
