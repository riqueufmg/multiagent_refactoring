    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate.ExplicitlyTypedUnboxingResponsible",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=45), has only 1 field (nof=1), no methods recorded (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependency list is small. These metrics indicate the class is already lightweight and not a candidate for further decomposition."
