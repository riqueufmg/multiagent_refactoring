    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC is small (49), number of methods (nom) is 0 and weighted method count (wmc) is 0, indicating no concentrated implementation to split. Coupling is minimal (fanin 0, fanout 0) and only two external dependencies are listed. With only 3 fields and no methods, there is no evidence of high size or complexity that would justify further decomposition."
