    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForJarFile",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc=181) while showing no method decomposition (nom=0, wmc=0). A class of this size with zero declared methods suggests substantial implementation is concentrated without being split into smaller, cohesive methods or helper classes. Although it has only 3 fields (nof=3) and few external dependencies, the high LOC together with lack of method-level modularization indicates it has not been sufficiently decomposed and is a candidate for further modularization."
