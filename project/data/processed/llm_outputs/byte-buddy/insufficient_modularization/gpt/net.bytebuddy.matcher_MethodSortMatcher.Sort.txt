    "justification": "Analyzed in isolation: LOC=80 but NOM=0 and WMC=0 indicate no internal method complexity to decompose; NOF=2 (small number of fields) and FANIN=0/FANOUT=0 show no coupling that suggests modularization needs; dependencies limited to itself. Overall metrics show low implementation complexity and no clear candidates for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
