    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC = 71, number of fields = 2, number of methods = 0 (nom = 0), WMC = 0. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and dependency list is short. LCOM value is not indicating poor cohesion (LCOM = -1.0, i.e. not applicable). Given the low size, zero measured method complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that this class requires further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
