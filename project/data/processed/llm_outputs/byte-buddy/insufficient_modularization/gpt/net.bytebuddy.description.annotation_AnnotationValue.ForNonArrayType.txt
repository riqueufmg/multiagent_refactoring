    "justification": "LOC = 121 indicates a relatively large class size while NOM = 0 and NOPM = 0 / NOPF = 0 show no decomposition into methods/parts in the provided metrics. Fanin = 0 and Fanout = 0 indicate the class is self-contained, so its large size is not explained by interactions. These elements (high LOC combined with zero method/part counts) suggest the class has not been sufficiently modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size/complexity."
