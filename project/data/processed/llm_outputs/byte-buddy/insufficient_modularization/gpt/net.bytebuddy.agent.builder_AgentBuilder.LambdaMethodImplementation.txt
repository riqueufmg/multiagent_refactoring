    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size and many fields with no internal decomposition: loc = 190 and nof = 9 indicate substantial implementation/state. nom = 0 and wmc = 0 show there are no methods (or no decomposition into methods) to manage that implementation, and LCOM is not helpful (-1.0). dit = 1 and fanin/fanout = 0 indicate the class is shallow in the hierarchy and self-contained. The combination of large LOC and many fields without methods strongly suggests the class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
