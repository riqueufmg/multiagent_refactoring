    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 180) and declares a relatively high number of fields (nof = 7) while interacting with multiple external types (dependencies: net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). These indicators (high LOC, many fields and several external dependencies) suggest multiple responsibilities or bundled behavior that could be split into smaller, more focused units. Although method/complexity metrics (nom = 0, wmc = 0) appear zero (possibly not recorded), the size and coupling metrics alone justify flagging insufficient modularization."
