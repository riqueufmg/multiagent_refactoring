    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Empty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show the class is small and not complex: loc=36, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), fanin=0, fanout=0 and only one listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). LCOM is -1 (not applicable), indicating no measurable cohesion issues. Given the lack of methods, low size, and negligible coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
