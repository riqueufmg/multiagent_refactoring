    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, simple class unlikely to suffer from insufficient modularization: loc=38, nof=2, nom=0, wmc=0, dit=0. Low coupling and usage (fanin=0, fanout=0) and minimal responsibilities (no methods) show no evidence that the class should be further decomposed. Dependencies are limited to two external types, so there is no sign of excessive size or complexity that would justify additional modularization."
