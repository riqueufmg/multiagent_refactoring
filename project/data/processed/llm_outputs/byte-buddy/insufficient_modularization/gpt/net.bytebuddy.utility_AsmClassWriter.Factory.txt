    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.Factory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows a large size (loc = 299) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and only a few fields (nof = 4). This combination indicates substantial implementation content not decomposed into methods or smaller classes. The class also lists multiple external dependencies (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AsmClassReader, OpenedClassReader, ClassFileVersion, AccessControllerPlugin, TypePool), suggesting it touches several concerns. Together these elements (high LOC, zero methods, multiple dependencies) justify that the class is a candidate for insufficient modularization and should be decomposed to reduce size and clarify responsibilities."
