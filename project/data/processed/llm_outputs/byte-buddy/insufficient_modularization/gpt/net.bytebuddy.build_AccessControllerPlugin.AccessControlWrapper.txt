    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin.AccessControlWrapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No smell detected: class shows no evidence of an undecomposed, overly large or complex unit. Metrics indicate 92 LOC but 0 methods (nom=0) and WMC=0, so there is no high implementation complexity or many responsibilities to decompose; LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion is not problematic; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling pressure within the provided isolation; number of fields (nof=6) alone does not imply insufficient modularization without accompanying high method count or complexity. Dependencies are present but do not by themselves indicate that this class contains mixed responsibilities requiring further decomposition."
