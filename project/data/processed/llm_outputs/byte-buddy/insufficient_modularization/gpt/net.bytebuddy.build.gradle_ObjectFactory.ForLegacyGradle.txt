    "justification": "No — metrics show the class is very small and not decomposable: LOC=13, NOM=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, no dependencies. LCOM=-1 indicates cohesion data not applicable. There is no evidence of high size, complexity, or coupling that would suggest insufficient modularization."
