    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=24, NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0, NOF=1 (one field), fanin=0 and fanout=0. With no methods and minimal size/complexity there is no evidence in the provided metrics that it contains multiple responsibilities or would benefit from further decomposition. Therefore, based on the given isolated metrics, it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
