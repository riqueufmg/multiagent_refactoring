    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: although LOC is 172, the class has 0 methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0), suggesting no large method bodies to split. It holds a small number of fields (nof=5) and shows high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is modest (dit=2). Given the lack of internal complexity or multiple responsibilities in the provided metrics, further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or implementation complexity."
