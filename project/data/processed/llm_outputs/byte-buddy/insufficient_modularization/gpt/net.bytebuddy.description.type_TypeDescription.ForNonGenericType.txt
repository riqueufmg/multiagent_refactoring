    "justification": "No evidence of Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=63), no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0) indicate little internal implementation to decompose; only one field (nof=1); low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and minimal dependencies; LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion. Given these metrics in isolation, the class does not show the typical signs (large size, high complexity, many responsibilities) that would warrant further decomposition."
