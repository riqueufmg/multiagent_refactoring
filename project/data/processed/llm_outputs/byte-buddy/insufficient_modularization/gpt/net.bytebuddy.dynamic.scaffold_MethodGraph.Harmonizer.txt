    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: LOC is moderate (105) but the class has no methods (nom=0) and a small number of fields (nof=4). Complexity measures are minimal (wmc=0), coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0), and cohesion metric is not indicating a problem (lcom=-1.0). Given these indicators in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
