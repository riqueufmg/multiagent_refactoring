    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForDefaultValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no indicators of insufficient modularization: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted methods complexity (wmc) = 0 indicate no method-level complexity to decompose; number of fields (nof) = 2 is small; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show no coupling that would suggest multiple responsibilities; dependencies are limited. Although loc = 92 is moderate, without methods, high complexity, many fields, or low cohesion (no evidence in provided metrics) there is no justification to flag the class as insufficiently modularized."
