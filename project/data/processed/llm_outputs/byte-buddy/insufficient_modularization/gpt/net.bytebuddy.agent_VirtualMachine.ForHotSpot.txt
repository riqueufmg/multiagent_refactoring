    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.ForHotSpot",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 1213) indicating too much implementation in one class; many fields (nof = 40, nopf = 9) implying substantial internal state and likely multiple responsibilities; absence of declared methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) which suggests the class is not cleanly decomposed into behavior-bearing units; LCOM = -1.0 and fanin/fanout = 0 provide no evidence of high cohesion or external modular interactions. These elements together justify that the class should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
