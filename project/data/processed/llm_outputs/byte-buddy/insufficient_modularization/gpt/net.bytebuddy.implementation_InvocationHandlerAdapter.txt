    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely case of Insufficient Modularization: it has substantial size (loc = 339) and concentrates many members (nof = 17 fields, nom = 10 methods) in one type. Its complexity is non-trivial (wmc = 12) while cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.4), indicating multiple responsibilities within the same class. The dependency list contains several inner/auxiliary types tied to this class (InvocationHandlerAdapter.WithoutPrivilegeConfiguration, InvocationHandlerAdapter.ForInstance, InvocationHandlerAdapter.AssignerConfigurable), which implies embedded subcomponents that could be split out. Taken together (large LOC, multiple fields/methods, moderate cohesion, and multiple embedded/related inner types), these elements justify flagging the class for further decomposition."
