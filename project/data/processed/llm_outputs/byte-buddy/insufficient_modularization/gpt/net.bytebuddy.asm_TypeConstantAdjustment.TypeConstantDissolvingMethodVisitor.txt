    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=35 (small), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods/low complexity), NOF=3 (few fields), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (low coupling), single dependency on net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader. In isolation there is no evidence the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
