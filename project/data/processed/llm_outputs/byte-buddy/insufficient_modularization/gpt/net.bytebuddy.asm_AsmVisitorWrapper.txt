    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large source size (loc = 510) while exposing few methods (nom = 3) indicates a lot of implementation concentrated in a single class; high number of fields (nof = 18) and multiple contained components/nested types (nc = 7) suggest many responsibilities or internal pieces that could be factored out. The class depends on a broad set of concerns (e.g. net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, description.* types, matcher.ElementMatcher, utility.OpenedClassReader, pool.TypePool), which reinforces the likelihood of mixed responsibilities. Although method complexity is low (wmc = 3) and cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) is not indicative of poor cohesion, the combination of large LOC, many fields, and several nested components justifies refactoring into smaller, focused modules."
