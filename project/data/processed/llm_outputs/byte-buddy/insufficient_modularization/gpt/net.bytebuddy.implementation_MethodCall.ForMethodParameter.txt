    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForMethodParameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of excessive size or complexity: LOC is 69, number of fields is 2 and number of methods is 0, WMC is 0, DIT is 0, and LCOM (-1.0) does not indicate poor cohesion. Coupling metrics (fanin and fanout) are 0 and the dependency list is small. Given the low size, low complexity, few fields and methods, and minimal coupling, there is insufficient evidence to call out Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
