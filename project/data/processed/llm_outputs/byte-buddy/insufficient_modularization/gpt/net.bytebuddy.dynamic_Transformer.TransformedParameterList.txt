    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=17, nof=0, nom=0, wmc=0, lcom=-1.0. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList). These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
