    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_benchmarkJdkProxy_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: it contains an extremely large number of fields (nof = 263) while exposing only a small number of methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8). This imbalance (many fields per method) indicates concentrated state that could be split into smaller, focused classes. The class also has moderate implementation complexity (wmc = 42) and non-trivial size (loc = 276), reinforcing that its responsibilities and state are substantial enough to warrant decomposition. These metrics together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
