    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=19, number of methods (nom)=2, number of public methods (nopm)=1. Low complexity: WMC=2. High cohesion indicated by LCOM=-1.0. No coupling pressure: fanin=0, fanout=0. Given its low size, low complexity, single public entry and lack of incoming/outgoing dependencies in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
