    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The provided metrics show no evidence of an inadequately decomposed class: loc=85 (moderate size), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods and no measured complexity), nof=3 (few fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling shown), and only minimal dependencies. Considering the class in isolation, these values indicate low size and complexity, so there is no indication of Insufficient Modularization."
