    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and low-complexity: LOC=13, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPM=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. There are no fields, methods, or dependencies reported. Given its minimal size and lack of internal complexity or coupling, there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further; therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
