    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=87 (moderate size) but WMC=0 and NOM=0 (no methods/behavior to decompose), NOF=3 (only three fields), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling), DIT=0 and NC=0 (no inheritance/children). There is no evidence of high implementation complexity or multiple responsibilities in the provided metrics, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
