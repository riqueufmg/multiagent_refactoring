    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.ForImplicitProperty",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large body (loc = 193) while reporting no declared methods (nom = 0) and only one field (nof = 1), which indicates substantial code/behavior that has not been decomposed into smaller methods or helper classes. The long implementation combined with many external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodReturn, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue) suggests the class is handling multiple responsibilities and collaborating with many types rather than delegating responsibilities to separate, smaller classes. These indicators (high LOC, zero methods, many dependencies) match the Insufficient Modularization smell."
