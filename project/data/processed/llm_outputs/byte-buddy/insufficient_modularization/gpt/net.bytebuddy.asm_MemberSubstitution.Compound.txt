    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=41, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), WMC=0, a single field (nof=1), LCOM indicates no cohesion concerns, and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its minimal size and lack of internal complexity, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
