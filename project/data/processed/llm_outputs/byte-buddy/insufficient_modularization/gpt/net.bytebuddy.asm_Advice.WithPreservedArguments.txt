    "justification": "Large size (loc = 274) combined with almost no decomposition (nom = 0 methods, nof = 1 field) indicates the class contains substantial implementation without being split into methods or smaller units. wmc = 0 and lcom = -1.0 further suggest no measured method structure or cohesion, and fanin/fanout = 0 shows low coupling that would otherwise justify a compact, single-purpose class. These elements together point to Insufficient Modularization: a large, monolithic class that should be decomposed."
