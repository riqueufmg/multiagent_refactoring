    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForStackManipulation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: large size (loc = 336) combined with a high number of fields (nof = 20) indicates substantial internal state and likely multiple responsibilities. The class depends on many distinct concerns (dependencies include net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue), suggesting it handles varied functionality. At the same time, method-level metrics are minimal (nom = 0, wmc = 0), implying implementation complexity is concentrated rather than decomposed into smaller methods. These elements (high LOC, many fields, many cross-cutting dependencies, and lack of decomposed methods) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
