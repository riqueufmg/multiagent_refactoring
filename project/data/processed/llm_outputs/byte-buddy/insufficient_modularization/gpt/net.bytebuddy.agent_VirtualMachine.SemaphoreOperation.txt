    "justification": "Class has 0 methods (nom=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3), small size (loc=20), zero complexity (wmc=0), no external interactions (fanin=0, fanout=0) and an LCOM indicating no cohesion problem (lcom=-1.0). These metrics indicate a tiny, simple data-holder with no internal complexity that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
