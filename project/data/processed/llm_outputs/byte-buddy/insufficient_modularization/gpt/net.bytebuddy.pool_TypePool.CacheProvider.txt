    "justification": "Large size with little decomposition: loc = 251 (high for a single class) while nom = 0 (no methods) and nopf = 0, and nof = 7 (multiple fields). The combination of high LOC and zero methods indicates the class holds substantial implementation/initialization without being decomposed into smaller classes or methods. fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show low external coupling, suggesting internal complexity rather than distributed responsibility. These elements indicate Insufficient Modularization."
