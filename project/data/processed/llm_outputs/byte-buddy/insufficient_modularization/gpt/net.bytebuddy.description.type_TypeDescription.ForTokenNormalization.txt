    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=25), only one field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/behavioral complexity (wmc=0). Low coupling is indicated by fanin=0 and fanout=0 and only two listed dependencies. Given these metrics in isolation, the class does not exhibit excess size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
