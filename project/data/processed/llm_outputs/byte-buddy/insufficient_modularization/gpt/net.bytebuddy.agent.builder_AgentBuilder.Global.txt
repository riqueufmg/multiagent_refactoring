    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an insufficiently modularized class: LOC is 64 (not large), number of methods (nom) = 0 and WMC = 0 (no behavioral complexity to decompose), number of fields (nof) = 3 (small), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (low coupling), LCOM = -1.0 (no meaningful cohesion measure given absence of methods). Given the small size, lack of methods/complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
