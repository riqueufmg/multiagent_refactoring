    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.TransformedMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 208) while containing a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 6) but no declared methods (nom = 0). In isolation this combination indicates substantial implementation content that is not split into smaller classes or methods. The class also references many external types (7 distinct dependencies), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities or concerns. Together these factors (high LOC, multiple fields, many dependencies, and lack of methods) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
