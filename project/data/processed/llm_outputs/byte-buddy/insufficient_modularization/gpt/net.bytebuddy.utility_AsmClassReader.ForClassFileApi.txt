    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a decomposable, monolithic class: number of methods nom=0, weighted method complexity wmc=0, number of fields nof=2, fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), dit=1, and LCOM=-1.0 (no reported cohesion problem). Although LOC=130, the absence of methods and complexity provides no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
