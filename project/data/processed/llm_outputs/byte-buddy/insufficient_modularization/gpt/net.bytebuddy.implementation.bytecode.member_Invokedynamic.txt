    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.Invokedynamic",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: loc=45, nom=2, nof=4, wmc=3 and lcom=0.0 indicate low size and low implementation complexity with high cohesion. Fanin=0 and fanout=0 show minimal coupling to other classes. Given these metrics (few methods, low complexity, low LOC and high cohesion), there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed; further modularization is not warranted based on the provided data."
