    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Trivial",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=61) and contains no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating no large un-decomposed implementation. Complexity is negligible (wmc=0), cohesion metric is not indicating internal fragmentation (lcom=-1.0 given), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency). These metrics provide no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
