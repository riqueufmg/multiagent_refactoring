    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.WithThrowawayExecutorService",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: LOC=51, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=2, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and only one dependency. With no methods (NOM=0) and very low coupling, there is no evidence the class has excessive size or implementation complexity that would require further decomposition. LCOM is not meaningful here, but other metrics collectively argue against insufficient modularization."
