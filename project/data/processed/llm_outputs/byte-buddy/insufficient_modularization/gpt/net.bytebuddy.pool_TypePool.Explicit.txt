    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=46, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1. No internal complexity or many methods to decompose (NOM=0), very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency), and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem given the absence of methods. These metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization."
