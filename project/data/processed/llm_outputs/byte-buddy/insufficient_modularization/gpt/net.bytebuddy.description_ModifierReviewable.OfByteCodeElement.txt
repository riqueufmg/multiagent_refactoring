    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that needs further decomposition: LOC is 45 (moderate size), NOM=0 and WMC=0 indicate no methods/behavioral complexity to decompose, DIT=1 shows shallow inheritance, FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 show no coupling pressures, and there are no dependencies. Given these elements, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
