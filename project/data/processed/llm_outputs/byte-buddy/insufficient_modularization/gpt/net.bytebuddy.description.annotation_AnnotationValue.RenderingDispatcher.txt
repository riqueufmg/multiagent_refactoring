    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.RenderingDispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 314) indicating substantial implementation in one class; non-trivial state (nof = 5) with a public field present (nopf = 1) suggesting limited encapsulation; very low/negative cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) implying responsibilities are not well grouped. Combined with zero reported fanin/fanout (isolated internal complexity) these elements indicate the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
