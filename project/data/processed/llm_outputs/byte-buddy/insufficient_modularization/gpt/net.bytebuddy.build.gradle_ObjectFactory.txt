    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ObjectFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it contains 107 LOC but only 2 methods (loc=107, nom=2), indicating large/monolithic method bodies rather than many small, focused methods. Cohesion is low (lcom=1.0), suggesting the class groups unrelated responsibilities. It also has 3 fields (nof=3) but very few methods (nom=2, nopm=1), implying functionality is concentrated rather than decomposed. The presence of related nested/inner types in its dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ObjectFactory.ForLegacyGradle, net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ObjectFactory.Dispatcher) further indicates opportunities to extract responsibilities into separate classes. Together these metrics justify that the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
