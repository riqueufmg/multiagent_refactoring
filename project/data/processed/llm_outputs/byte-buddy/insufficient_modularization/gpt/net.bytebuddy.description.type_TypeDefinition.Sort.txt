    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 144) while exposing almost no internal decomposition (nom = 0 methods, nof = 1 field, wmc = 0). Low interaction metrics (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and zero inheritance depth (dit = 0) combined with high LOC indicate the implementation is concentrated in a single unit rather than decomposed into methods or subcomponents. These elements (high LOC with zero methods and minimal fields) justify detection of Insufficient Modularization."
