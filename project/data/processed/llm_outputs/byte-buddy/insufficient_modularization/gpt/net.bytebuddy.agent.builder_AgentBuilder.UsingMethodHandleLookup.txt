    "justification": "The provided metrics do not show evidence of insufficient modularization. Although LOC = 104 could suggest moderate size, all structural/computational indicators are missing or zero: number of methods (nom) = 0, number of public fields (nopf) = 0, weighted method count (wmc) = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0, and dependencies = []. LCOM = -1.0 appears to be invalid/uncomputed. In isolation there is no measured high complexity, many responsibilities, or low cohesion to justify further decomposition, so the smell is not detected."
