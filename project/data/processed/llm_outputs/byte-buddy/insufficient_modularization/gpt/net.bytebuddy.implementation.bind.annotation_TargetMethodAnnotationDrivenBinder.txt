    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely instance of Insufficient Modularization: it has a large size (loc = 442) combined with a high number of fields (nof = 18) while exposing very few methods (nom = 3, nopm = 2), indicating large, monolithic method bodies. Cohesion is low (lcom = 0.6667), suggesting multiple responsibilities. The class also contains multiple nested types/roles (ParameterBinder, DelegationProcessor, Handler) and depends on many external concepts (numerous dependencies listed), which together indicate it groups distinct concerns that could be split into smaller classes/modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
