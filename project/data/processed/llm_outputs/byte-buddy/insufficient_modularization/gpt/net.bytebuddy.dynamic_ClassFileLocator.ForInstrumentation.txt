    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForInstrumentation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 475) indicating multiple responsibilities or a long implementation; a relatively high number of fields (nof = 16) suggesting considerable internal state to manage; multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin) implying the class interacts with varied concerns; low/undefined cohesion indicator (lcom = -1.0) which may point to mixed responsibilities; and shallow inheritance (dit = 1) meaning responsibilities are not distributed via subclassing. Together these elements justify flagging this class as a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
