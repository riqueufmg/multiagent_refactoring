    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and has no decomposable responsibilities: LOC=31, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0. Coupling and usage are minimal (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, single dependency on net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). DIT=0 and LCOM=-1 (no applicable cohesion data) further show no internal complexity to split. Given the absence of methods/fields and low size/complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
