    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Empty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is very small (LOC=18), has no methods or fields (NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPF=0, NOPM=0), zero measured complexity (WMC=0), no coupling (FANOUT=0, FANIN=0), and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). These metrics indicate the class is minimal and does not require further decomposition."
