    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. Metrics show nom=0 and nof=1 (no many methods/fields to decompose), wmc=0 (no measured cyclomatic complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), and LCOM=-1.0 (indicating cohesion). Although LOC=114 is moderate, it is not accompanied by high complexity, many methods, or high coupling that would suggest a need for further decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of an undecomposed, overly large or complex class in the provided data."
