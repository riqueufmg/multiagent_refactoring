    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingUnsafe",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size and many fields indicate a class that likely bundles multiple responsibilities: LOC = 466 and NOF = 12. The class lists diverse dependencies (JavaDispatcher, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AccessControllerPlugin, ClassLoadingStrategy, PackageDescription, etc.), suggesting it mixes concerns (dispatching, hash/equals helpers, access control, class loading) that could be separated. Additionally, NOM = 0 while LOC is large implies substantial implementation complexity outside simple small methods (e.g., large initializer blocks or inner constructs), further signalling that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
