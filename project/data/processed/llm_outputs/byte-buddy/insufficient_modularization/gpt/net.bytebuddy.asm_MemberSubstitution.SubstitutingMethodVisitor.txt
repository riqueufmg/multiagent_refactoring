    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.SubstitutingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LOC = 234 (large class size) and NOF = 12 (many fields) indicate substantial implementation inside this single class. DIT = 1 (shallow inheritance) shows the class is not decomposed via subclassing. NOM = 0 together with high LOC suggests a monolithic implementation structure (few distinct measured methods but high lines of code). LCOM = -1.0 signals potential cohesion concerns. The class depends on a wide range of external types (12 listed dependencies), implying multiple responsibilities and coupling to varied concepts. Taken in isolation, these elements indicate the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and is a candidate for modularization/refactoring."
