    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithProxy_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: extremely high number of fields (nof = 263) while having few methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) resulting in a very high fields‑per‑method ratio (~29.2). Implementation complexity is nontrivial (wmc = 42) and there is substantial state to manage within a single class (loc = 276). Although cohesion metric lcom = 0.0 is low, the disproportionate amount of state relative to behavior (many fields, few methods) indicates the class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization (split out state/concerns into separate classes)."
