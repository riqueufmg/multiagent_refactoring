    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc=92) with a small number of fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0). Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (dit=0). There is no evidence of a large, complex, or monolithic implementation that would require further decomposition."
