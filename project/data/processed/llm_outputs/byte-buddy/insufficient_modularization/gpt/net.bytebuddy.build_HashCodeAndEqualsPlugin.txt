    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 342) with a relatively small number of methods (nom = 9) implying very large methods; many fields (nof = 10) and most methods are public (nopm = 8) suggesting a wide surface and multiple responsibilities. Complexity is non-trivial (wmc = 14) and cohesion is low (lcom ≈ 0.777), indicating methods are not tightly related. The dependency list includes multiple inner/component-like types (ValueMatcher, AnnotationOrderComparator, Sort, InvokeSuper) which implies the class groups multiple roles that could be split. Together these metrics support that the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
