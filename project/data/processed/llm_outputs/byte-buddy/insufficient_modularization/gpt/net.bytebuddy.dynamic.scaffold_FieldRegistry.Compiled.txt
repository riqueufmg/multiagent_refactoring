    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldRegistry.Compiled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC is moderate (82), WMC is 0 and NOM is 0 (no method complexity), and fan-in/fan-out are 0, suggesting low implementation complexity and coupling. Number of fields (NOF = 6) is not excessive by itself and there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or high cohesion problems in the provided metrics. Therefore, based on the given data for this class in isolation, there is insufficient evidence to report Insufficient Modularization."
