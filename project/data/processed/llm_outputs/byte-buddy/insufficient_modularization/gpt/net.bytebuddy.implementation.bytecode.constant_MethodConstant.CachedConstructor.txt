    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.MethodConstant.CachedConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=45), very few fields (nof=2) and no methods (nom=0) indicating it is likely a simple data holder; low complexity (wmc=0), high cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0), shallow inheritance depth (dit=1), and no coupling evidence (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependencies are limited and do not indicate multiple responsibilities. Based on these isolated metrics, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
