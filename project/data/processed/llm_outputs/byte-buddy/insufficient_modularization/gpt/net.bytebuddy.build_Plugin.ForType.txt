    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, simple class: LOC=39, number of fields=2, number of methods=0, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, fanout=0. There are no methods or significant complexity or coupling that suggest the class contains multiple responsibilities that should be split. Dependency count is minimal (1). Based on these elements, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
