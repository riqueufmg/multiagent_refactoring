    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class examined in isolation shows no evidence of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=38), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), minimal state (nof=1), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and low cohesion indicator not meaningful (lcom=-1.0). Dependency list is short and does not indicate internal complexity. These factors suggest the class is already compact and does not require further decomposition."
