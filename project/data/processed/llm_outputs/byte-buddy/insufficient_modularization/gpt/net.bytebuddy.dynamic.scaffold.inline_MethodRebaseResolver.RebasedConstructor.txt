    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodRebaseResolver.RebasedConstructor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: moderate size (loc = 76) while exposing only 2 fields (nof = 2) and no declared methods (nom = 0), which suggests concentrated logic rather than decomposition. It depends on many distinct concerns (AnnotationValue, AnnotationList, ParameterDescription, ParameterList, TypeList, MethodDescription, TypeDescription), indicating multiple responsibilities are handled in one place. These factors together justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
