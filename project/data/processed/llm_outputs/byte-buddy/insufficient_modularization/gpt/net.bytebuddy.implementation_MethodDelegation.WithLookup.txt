    "justification": "Class shows no sign of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=36), only 1 field (nof=1) and 0 methods (nom=0), zero cyclomatic/complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing usage (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependency set is small. Metrics indicate the class is minimal and does not require further decomposition."
