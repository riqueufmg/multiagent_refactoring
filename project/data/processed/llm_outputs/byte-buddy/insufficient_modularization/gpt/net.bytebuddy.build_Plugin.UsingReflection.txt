    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.UsingReflection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size (loc = 488) combined with many fields (nof = 18) and no methods recorded (nom = 0) indicates the class has not been decomposed into smaller units. Zero fan-in and fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and the single dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) suggest the implementation is self-contained and monolithic. The metrics point to insufficient modularization (high LOC and field count with no method-level decomposition)."
