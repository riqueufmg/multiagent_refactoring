    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ModifierAdjustment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is large (loc = 349) with many methods (nom = 23, of which nopm = 22 are public), has substantial complexity (wmc = 25), and maintains a moderate cohesion (lcom = 0.5217) indicating multiple responsibilities. It also defines an inner type (net.bytebuddy.asm.ModifierAdjustment.ModifierAdjustingClassVisitor) and depends on many different concerns (visitor/implementation/type/field/method matchers and descriptors), suggesting mixed responsibilities. The number of fields (nof = 11) combined with the large public API and complexity implies the class could be decomposed further to reduce size and implementation complexity."
