    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.HasSuperClassMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=34), low method count (nom=3, nopm=2), low-to-moderate complexity (wmc=6), single field (nof=1), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), and no external coupling indicated by fanin=0 and fanout=0. Dependencies are limited and the class is compact, so there is no evidence that it should be further decomposed."
