    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class shows no signs of under-modularization in isolation. Metrics indicate small/low-complexity implementation (loc=79, wmc=0, nom=0) with only two fields (nof=2) and no methods to decompose; cohesion metric does not indicate poor cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Additionally fan-in and fan-out are zero, suggesting no internal coupling that would benefit from further decomposition. Based on these elements, further decomposition is not warranted."
