    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=14, WMC=0, number of methods=0, number of fields=1. Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition (no insufficient modularization)."
