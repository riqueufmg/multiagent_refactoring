    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.StubInvocationBenchmark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Despite a relatively high LOC (203) and 14 fields, the class shows low implementation complexity and high cohesion: WMC=6, NOM=6, LCOM=0.0, DIT=0. These metrics indicate a small number of methods with low complexity and strong internal cohesion, providing no clear evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or should be decomposed further."
