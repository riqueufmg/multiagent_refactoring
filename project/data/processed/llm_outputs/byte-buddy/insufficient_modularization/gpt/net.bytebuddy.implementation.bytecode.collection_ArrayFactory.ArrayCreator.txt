    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayFactory.ArrayCreator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 107 LOC, it shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted method count (wmc) = 0 indicate no large method-based responsibility, lack of cohesion (lcom) = -1.0 implies good cohesion, and coupling metrics fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show low external coupling. Depth of inheritance (dit) = 1 and a small set of dependencies further indicate the class is not a large monolithic unit requiring further decomposition."
