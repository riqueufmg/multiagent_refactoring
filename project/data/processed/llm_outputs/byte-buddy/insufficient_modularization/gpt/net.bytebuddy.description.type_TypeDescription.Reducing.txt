    "justification": "No evidence of Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=82), very low internal content (nom=0 methods, nof=2 fields), zero measured complexity (wmc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only two dependencies. The LCOM value (-1.0) indicates lack of cohesion data rather than a clear cohesion problem. These metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition."
