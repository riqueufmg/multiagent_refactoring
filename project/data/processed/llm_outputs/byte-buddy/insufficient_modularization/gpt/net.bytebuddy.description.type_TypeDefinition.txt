    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively large size (loc = 271) combined with a non-trivial number of responsibilities (nom = 15, wmc = 15). It depends on many distinct concerns (AnnotatedType, Sort, RecordComponentList, TypeList, TypeDescription, MethodList, FieldList, ModifierReviewable, StackSize, etc.), indicating it handles multiple aspects of type description (annotations, record components, type lists, methods, fields, modifiers). It holds few fields (nof = 3) and has shallow inheritance (dit = 1), suggesting behavior is centralized in this single class rather than decomposed into smaller, cohesive classes. These elements together justify that further decomposition would likely reduce the class size and complexity."
