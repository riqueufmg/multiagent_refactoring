    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, low-complexity class: loc=47, nof=5, nom=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=1, lcom=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0. The class has limited size and zero measured method complexity; although it contains 5 fields, there is no evidence of high implementation complexity or large size that would justify further decomposition in isolation. Dependencies are few and limited, supporting the conclusion that Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
