    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.NamedElement.WithRuntimeName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class analyzed in isolation shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=15), no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (dit=1) and no cohesion concerns indicated (lcom=-1.0). Given these metrics and the absence of dependencies, the class does not require further decomposition."
