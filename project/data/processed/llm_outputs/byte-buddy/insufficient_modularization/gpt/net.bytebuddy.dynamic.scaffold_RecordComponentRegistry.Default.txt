    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undivided, complex-bodied class that would benefit from further decomposition: although LOC is 171 and there are 9 fields (nof = 9, loc = 171), the class shows no measured method complexity (nom = 0, wmc = 0), very low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), simple inheritance (dit = 1) and high cohesion (lcom = -1.0). The listed dependencies exist but do not imply internal sprawling responsibilities within this class in isolation. Therefore there is no clear evidence of insufficient modularization."
