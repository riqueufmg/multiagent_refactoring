    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an overly large or complex class that requires further decomposition: LOC=88 with nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods to split), nof=1 (single field), WMC=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling). These elements show low internal complexity and responsibility concentration, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
