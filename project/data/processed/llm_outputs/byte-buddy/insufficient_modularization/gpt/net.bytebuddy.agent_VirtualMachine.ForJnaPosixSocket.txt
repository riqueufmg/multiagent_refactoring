    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.ForJnaPosixSocket",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 213) combined with a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 6) while reporting no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0). This indicates substantial code/data concentrated in a single class rather than decomposed into smaller cooperating classes or methods. Additional indicators: zero measured complexity (wmc = 0) and no dependency interactions recorded (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) reinforce that behavior is not broken into modular units; the anomalous cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) further suggests irregular decomposition. Together these elements justify flagging this class as suffering from Insufficient Modularization."
