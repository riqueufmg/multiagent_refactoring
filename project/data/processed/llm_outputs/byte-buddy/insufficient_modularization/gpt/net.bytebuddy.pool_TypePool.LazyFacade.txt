    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: low method count (nom=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) show the class is not large or complex; fields are limited (nof=5) and size is moderate (loc=91) but not excessive; cohesion metric is strong (lcom=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these values, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
