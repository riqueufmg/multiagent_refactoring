    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undersized decomposition: LOC is small (44), number of fields is modest (nof=4) and there are no methods (nom=0) or measurable complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one external dependency is listed (org.gradle.api.provider.Provider). These elements suggest the class is small and not exhibiting signs of excessive size or complexity that would require further modularization."
