    "justification": "High class size with insufficient decomposition: LOC = 147 while number of methods (nom) = 0 and number of fields (nof) = 1, indicating a large implementation body without being split into methods. Low modularity indicators (wmc = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and minimal dependencies (2) reinforce that the class contains substantial code that has not been decomposed into smaller units or collaborators, i.e., insufficient modularization."
