    "justification": "Class is very small and already minimal: loc=19, nof=0 (no fields), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity). There are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no package/member counts to suggest internal size or complexity (nopf=0, nopm=0). Given the lack of methods/fields and low complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
