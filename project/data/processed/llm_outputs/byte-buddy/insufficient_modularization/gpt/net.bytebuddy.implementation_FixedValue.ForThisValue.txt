    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.ForThisValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: very low implementation size and complexity (loc=62, wmc=0), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only one field (nof=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is small and not overloaded with responsibilities, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
