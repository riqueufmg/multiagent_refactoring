    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.WithCustomMapping",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modular: it has very high size (loc = 402) while reporting almost no method-level decomposition (nom = 0, wmc = 0) and only 2 fields (nof = 2), which suggests large monolithic code blocks rather than well-factored methods/parts. It also depends on many distinct types (12 external dependencies listed), indicating multiple responsibilities or concerns being handled inside the same class. These indicators (LOC=402, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=2, 12 dependencies) justify recommending further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
