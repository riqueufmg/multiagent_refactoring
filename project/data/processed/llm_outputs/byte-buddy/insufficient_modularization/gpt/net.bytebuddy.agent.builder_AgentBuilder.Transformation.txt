    "justification": "High size with limited modular structure: loc=221 indicates a large class body while nom=0 and wmc=0 show no decomposed methods to distribute behavior. nof=16 (many fields/elements) combined with zero methods suggests functionality is not partitioned into smaller units. Zero fanin/fanout and the provided dependencies do not indicate decomposition either. These factors (loc=221, nof=16, nom=0, wmc=0) justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
