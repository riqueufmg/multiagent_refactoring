    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.ToStringMethod.ForFixedValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show the class is small and simple: LOC=22, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, no private fields reported, and LCOM not indicating cohesion issues. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Given the low size, zero method complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
