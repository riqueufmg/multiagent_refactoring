    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList.Executable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no indicators of being insufficiently modular: very small size (loc=23), no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/weighted method count (wmc=0), zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a negative/neutral LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) consistent with lack of internal complexity. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition."
