    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForField",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is relatively large (loc = 138) while declaring multiple fields (nof = 5) but reporting no methods (nom = 0), which suggests it holds substantial state and/or mixed responsibilities rather than a focused behavior. It also depends on many external types (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation), indicating it interacts with diverse concerns. These factors (high LOC, multiple fields, and multiple dependencies with no distinct methods) justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
