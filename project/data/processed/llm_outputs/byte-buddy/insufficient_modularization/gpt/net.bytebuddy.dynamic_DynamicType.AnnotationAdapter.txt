    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition: LOC = 45 (small), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods/low complexity), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no coupling evidence). LCOM = -1.0 is invalid/unreliable for cohesion assessment. Considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity to justify Insufficient Modularization."
