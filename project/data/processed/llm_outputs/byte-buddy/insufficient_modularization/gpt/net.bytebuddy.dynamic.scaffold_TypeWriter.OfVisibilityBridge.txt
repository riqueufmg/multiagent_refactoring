    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is large (loc = 191) and holds multiple fields (nof = 6), which suggests multiple responsibilities concentrated in one class. Its dependency list spans many distinct concerns (AnnotationValue, ByteCodeAppender, Implementation, AnnotationValueFilter, ParameterDescription, ParameterList, TypeList, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, MethodAttributeAppender), indicating it interacts with annotation handling, bytecode appending, method/parameter description and type description — a sign of mixed responsibilities that could be separated. The lack of declared methods (nom = 0) combined with the size implies logic and complexity are concentrated rather than decomposed into smaller, focused units. These elements together justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
