    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc: 94) while declaring no methods (nom: 0) and only two fields (nof: 2). The absence of methods combined with substantial lines of code indicates functionality is not modularized (likely concentrated in initializers or inline code) and could be split into smaller, focused methods or helper classes. Additional metrics reinforce this: wmc: 0 and lcom: -1.0 show no measurable method-level structure/cohesion, and fanin/fanout: 0 shows no external decomposition. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
