    "justification": "Metrics show the class is very small and non-complex: LOC=19, NOM=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). LCOM is not meaningful (-1.0). There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or high cohesion that would indicate it has not been decomposed; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
