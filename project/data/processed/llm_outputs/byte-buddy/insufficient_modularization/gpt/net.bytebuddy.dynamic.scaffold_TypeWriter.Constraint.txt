    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 1022) indicating a monolithic implementation; small number of fields (nof = 5) but zero reported methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) suggesting concentrated, complex implementation rather than well-decomposed behavior; dependencies on multiple distinct concerns (net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.PackageDescription) imply the class handles varied responsibilities. These elements together justify refactoring into smaller, more focused classes."
