{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.BooleanMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=43), low method count (nom=4), low complexity (wmc=4), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), few fields (nof=3) and no coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided data."
