    "justification": "The class is small and contains no internal decomposition candidates: LOC = 18, number of methods (nom) = 0, weighted methods per class (wmc) = 0, fan-out = 0, fan-in = 0. With no methods or measurable internal complexity (and LCOM = -1.0 indicating no cohesion issues in the provided data), there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that it would benefit from additional modularization."
