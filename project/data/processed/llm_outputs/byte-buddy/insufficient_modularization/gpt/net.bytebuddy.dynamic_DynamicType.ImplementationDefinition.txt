    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=49), no fields or methods reported (nof=0, nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only one listed dependency (AnnotationDescription). These metrics indicate a minimal, low-responsibility unit rather than a large, decomposable class."
