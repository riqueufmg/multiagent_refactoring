    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class: LOC = 137 (moderate size) but NOM = 0, NOF = 0, WMC = 0 and FANOUT = 0, showing no internal method/complexity surface to decompose. Dependency list is minimal (2 types) and FANIN = 0, suggesting low coupling. LCOM = -1.0 appears as unavailable. Based on the provided isolated metrics there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would justify marking this class as suffering from Insufficient Modularization."
