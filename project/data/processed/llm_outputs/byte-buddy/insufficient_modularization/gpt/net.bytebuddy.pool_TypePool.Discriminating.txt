    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: small size (loc=51), low complexity (wmc=0), few fields (nof=3) and no methods (nom=0) so there is no internal implementation complexity to further decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, single dependency listed), and other cohesion/inheritance metrics (lcom=-1.0, dit=0) do not suggest a large monolithic responsibility. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
