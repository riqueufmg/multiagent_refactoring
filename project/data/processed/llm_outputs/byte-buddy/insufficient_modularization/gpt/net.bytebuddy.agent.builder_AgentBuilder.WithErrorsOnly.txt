    "justification": "Class is small and lacks internal complexity that would warrant further decomposition: LOC = 19, WMC = 0, NOM = 0 (no methods), NOF = 1 (single field), FANIN = 0, FANOUT = 0. There are no methods or measurable complexity to split, and the single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) does not indicate internal cohesion problems. Based on these metrics, Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
