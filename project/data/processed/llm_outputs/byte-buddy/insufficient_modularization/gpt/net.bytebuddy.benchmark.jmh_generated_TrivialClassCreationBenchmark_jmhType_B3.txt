    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High number of fields (nof = 256) with no methods (nom = 0) indicates a large, undivided data holder; very low lines of code (loc = 18) combined with excessive fields suggests the class aggregates many responsibilities/state without decomposition. Additional indicators: lack of behavior (wmc = 0), low/no external coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) implying the class itself contains the bulk of implementation. These metrics point to Insufficient Modularization (a class that should be decomposed)."
