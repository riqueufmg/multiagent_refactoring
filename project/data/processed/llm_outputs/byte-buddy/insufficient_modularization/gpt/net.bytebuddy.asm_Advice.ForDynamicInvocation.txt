    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForDynamicInvocation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: moderate-to-high size (loc=99) combined with a relatively large number of fields (nof=6) while reporting no methods (nom=0) suggests the class is carrying multiple pieces of state/concern that are not separated into smaller cooperating types. The class is isolated by low coupling counts (fanin=0, fanout=0) yet depends on several external abstractions (dependencies include TypeDescription, MethodDescription, TypeList, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), which points to multiple responsibilities being handled inside this single unit. Given these metrics in isolation, further decomposition (splitting state/concerns into smaller classes) would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
