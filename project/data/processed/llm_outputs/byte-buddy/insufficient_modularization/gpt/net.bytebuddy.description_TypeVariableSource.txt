    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of Insufficient Modularization: LOC is moderate (118) and NOM is small (7), so size is limited; WMC is low (7) indicating low implementation complexity; LCOM = -1.0 indicates good cohesion; fanin/fanout = 0 show low coupling; dependencies are limited and focused (Visitor, TypeList, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, ModifierReviewable). These metrics together indicate the class is cohesive and not in need of further decomposition."
