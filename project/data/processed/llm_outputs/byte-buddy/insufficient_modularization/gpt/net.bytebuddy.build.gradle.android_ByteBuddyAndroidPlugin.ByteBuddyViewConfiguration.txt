    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=34, nof=1 and nom=0 (very few members/methods), WMC=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate low cohesion in this isolated view. These metrics show no evidence that the class is oversized or overly complex and do not justify further decomposition."
