    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy.Strategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 160 lines of code (loc=160) and 4 fields (nof=4), indicating substantial size and state. The metrics show zero measured methods/complexity (nom=0, wmc=0) while LOC remains high, suggesting functionality is concentrated rather than split into well-scoped, modular methods or helper types. The combination of high LOC with multiple fields and minimal external dependencies (1) supports the conclusion that the class is insufficiently modularized and could benefit from decomposition into smaller responsibilities."
