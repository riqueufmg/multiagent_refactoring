    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=18), no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0); only dependency is an external HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
