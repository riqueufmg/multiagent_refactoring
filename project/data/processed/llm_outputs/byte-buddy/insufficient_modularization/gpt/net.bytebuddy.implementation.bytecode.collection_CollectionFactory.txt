    "justification": "The class is small and simple: nom=2 methods, loc=16 lines, wmc=2 (low complexity), nc=1 constructor. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate a compact, cohesive implementation that does not exhibit the size or complexity typical of Insufficient Modularization; further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
