    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.UnresolvedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: low size and complexity (loc=37, wmc=0), no methods to split (nom=0), only two fields (nof=2), high cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0), and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
