    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=28, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0. It has no methods (nom=0) and minimal state (nof=1), very low complexity (wmc=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not show evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
