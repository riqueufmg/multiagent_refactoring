    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfMatchedField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=22), only one field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited to two types. These metrics indicate the class is already simple and does not require further decomposition."
