    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.ClassConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LOC = 139 with NOM = 4 (NOPM = 3): the class contains relatively few methods but a large number of lines, indicating large/complex method bodies that could be split. WMC = 13: overall cyclomatic/implementation complexity is high for a small number of methods, suggesting multiple responsibilities or complex internal logic. LCOM = 0.75: low cohesion among methods, indicating the class likely mixes different concerns. NOF = 5 and NOPF = 0 further suggest internal state plus encapsulated behavior that could be redistributed. These metrics together (high LOC and WMC, high LCOM, few methods) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from decomposition."
