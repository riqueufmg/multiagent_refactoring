    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is small (79), number of methods is modest (nom=8, nopm=6), and cyclomatic/maintenance complexity is low (wmc=8). Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.375) and the class has few fields (nof=3). There is no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no evidence of broad coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 3 listed dependencies). Combined, these elements suggest the class is small, cohesive, and not a clear candidate for further decomposition."
