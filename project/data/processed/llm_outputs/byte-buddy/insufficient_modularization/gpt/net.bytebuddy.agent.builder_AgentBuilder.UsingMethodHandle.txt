    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and lacks internal complexity or responsibilities that can be decomposed: LOC = 35, NOM (number of methods) = 0, WMC = 0, NOF (number of fields) = 1. Coupling is minimal (FANIN = 0, FANOUT = 0). Although there are listed external dependencies, the class itself defines no methods to split and has very low size and complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
