    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: loc=28, nof (fields)=2, nom (methods)=0, nopm=0. Complexity is negligible (wmc=0), inheritance depth is 0 (dit=0), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem here. Given the low size, zero method complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
