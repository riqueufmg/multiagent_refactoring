    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=57, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=2. It shows no inheritance depth (DIT=0), very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a cohesive indicator (LCOM=-1.0). Given the limited number of fields/methods and minimal complexity and coupling, there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further or that it holds multiple responsibilities—Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
