    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.ForDeclaredMethods",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has large size (loc = 240) while containing many fields (nof = 11) but no methods or measurable behavior (nom = 0, nopm = 0, wmc = 0). This combination (many fields, no methods) suggests accumulated state and responsibilities that have not been decomposed. The class also references multiple external types (dependencies include net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool), indicating it interacts with several concerns and could be split into smaller, more focused components. Given these metrics in isolation, further decomposition is warranted."
