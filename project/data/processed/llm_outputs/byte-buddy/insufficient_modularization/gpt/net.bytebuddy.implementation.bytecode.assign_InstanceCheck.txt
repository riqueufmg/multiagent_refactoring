    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=34, nom=3, wmc=4, nopm=2. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0) and inheritance depth is minimal (dit=0). It has a single field (nof=1) and no measured incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its limited size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
