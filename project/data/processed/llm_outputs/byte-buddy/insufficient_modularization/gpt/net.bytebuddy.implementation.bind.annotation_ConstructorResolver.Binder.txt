    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively large size (loc = 128) while declaring no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0), which suggests behavior is not decomposed into smaller methods or components. It holds some state (nof = 3) and references many external types (dependencies list contains 9 distinct types), indicating multiple responsibilities or interactions that would benefit from splitting. The low/invalid cohesion indicator (lcom = -1.0) and a nonzero body size despite wmc = 0 imply complexity is present but not organized into methods, supporting the conclusion that further decomposition would reduce size and implementation complexity."
