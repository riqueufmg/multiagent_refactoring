    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and trivial: LOC=25, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, DIT=1, LCOM=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0. No methods or fields to decompose, very low complexity and minimal coupling (only two listed dependencies). Based on these isolated metrics there is no indication the class suffers from insufficient modularization."
