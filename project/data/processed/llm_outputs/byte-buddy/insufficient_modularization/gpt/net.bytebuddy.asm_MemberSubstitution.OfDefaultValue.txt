    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Evaluated in isolation using provided metrics: LOC = 35 (small size), WMC = 0 (no measured complexity), NOM = 0 and NOPM = 0 (no methods to decompose), NOF = 1 (single field), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling), DIT = 0 (no inheritance depth). Given the small size, absence of methods/complex logic, and lack of coupling, there is no evidence that the class has excessive size or implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. Dependencies listed do not indicate internal complexity. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
