    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: loc=23, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted methods per class (wmc)=0, number of fields (nof)=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no evidence of high implementation complexity or size. Although there are three listed dependencies, the class metrics indicate it is already narrowly scoped and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
