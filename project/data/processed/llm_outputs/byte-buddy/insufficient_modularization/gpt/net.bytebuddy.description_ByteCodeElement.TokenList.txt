    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: loc=51 (modest size), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods/complexity to split), nof=1 (single field), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), dependencies limited to two types. LCOM is not meaningful (-1.0). Given the small size, lack of methods, and low coupling, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
