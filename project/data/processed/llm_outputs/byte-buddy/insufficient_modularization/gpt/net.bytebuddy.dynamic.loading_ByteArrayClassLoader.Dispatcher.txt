    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and simple: LOC=24, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods or fields to decompose and minimal dependencies (only net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Given its low size and complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
