    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small size (LOC=68), moderate number of methods (nom=7, nopm=6), low overall complexity (WMC=7), high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), only 3 fields (nof=3) and no coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0, DIT=0). These values suggest the class is cohesive and not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
