    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: number of methods (nom)=0 and weighted method complexity (wmc)=0 show no behavioral complexity to split; number of fields (nof)=2 is small; fanin=0 and fanout=0 and no dependencies indicate low coupling; although loc=70, the absence of methods/complexity (nc=0, lcom=-1.0) provides no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
