    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForPackageType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Based on the provided isolated metrics there is no evidence of insufficient modularization. The class has LOC=98 (moderate size), but NOF=0 and NOM=0 indicate no detected fields or methods to decompose further. WMC=0 shows no internal complexity, LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion concerns reported), and FANIN=0 / FANOUT=0 with a single dependency (PackageDescription) show very low coupling. Given the absence of internal responsibilities or complexity to split, there is no justification to mark this class as insufficiently modularized."
