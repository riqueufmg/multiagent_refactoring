    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Factory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a non-trivial size (loc = 112) while declaring few fields (nof = 3) and no methods (nom = 0), indicating substantial implementation located in a single entity rather than decomposed into smaller units. It depends on many external types (12 entries: net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType), suggesting multiple responsibilities and coupling that could be split. Given the combination of moderate LOC and a broad dependency set while lacking distinct methods, the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
