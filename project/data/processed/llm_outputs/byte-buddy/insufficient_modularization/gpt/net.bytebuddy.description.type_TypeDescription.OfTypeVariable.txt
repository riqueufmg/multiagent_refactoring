    "justification": "The class is small and simple in isolation: LOC=31, 1 field (nof=1), zero methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no internal cohesion concerns indicated (lcom=-1.0 as N/A). Given its minimal size, lack of methods, and low complexity and coupling, there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further or that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
