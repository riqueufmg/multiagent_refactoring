    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small and low-complexity (loc=21, wmc=0), defines no methods or fields (nom=0, nof=0), and shows no coupling by the provided metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is -1.0 (no cohesion concern given no methods). Although the dependency list contains several external types, the class size and complexity metrics indicate it is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
