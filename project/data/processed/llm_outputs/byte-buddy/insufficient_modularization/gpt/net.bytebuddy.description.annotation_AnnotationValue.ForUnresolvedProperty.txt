    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, non-complex class: LOC=18, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0, dependencies=[]. There are no methods or fields to decompose and complexity is nil, so there is no evidence that the class suffers from insufficient modularization."
