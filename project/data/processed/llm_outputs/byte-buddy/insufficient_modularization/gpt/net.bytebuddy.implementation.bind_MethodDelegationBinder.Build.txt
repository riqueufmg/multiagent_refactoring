    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Build",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no sign of being insufficiently modular: modest size (loc=69), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0) indicate low implementation complexity; only 5 fields (nof=5); no incoming or outgoing coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0); limited external dependencies. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
