    "justification": "Metrics indicate no smell: small size (loc=46), minimal state (nof=1), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (dit=0). These values show the class is small and low-complexity, so there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
