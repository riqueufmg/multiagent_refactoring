    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ExceptionHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a non-trivial size (loc = 104) and contains multiple fields (nof = 5) while reporting no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0). This combination (several fields with no behavioral decomposition) indicates responsibilities are likely bundled as state rather than separated into smaller collaborating classes. Cohesion metrics are inconclusive/poor (lcom = -1.0) and the class depends on multiple distinct types (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Throw, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Removal, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation), suggesting it spans multiple concerns. Taken in isolation, these elements justify flagging the class for further decomposition to reduce size and improve modularity."
