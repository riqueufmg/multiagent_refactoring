    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: nom=3 methods, nof=3 fields, wmc=3 (low complexity). LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1) and there are no plugin-specific method/field counts (nopf=0, nopm=0). Given the low method count, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or needs further decomposition."
