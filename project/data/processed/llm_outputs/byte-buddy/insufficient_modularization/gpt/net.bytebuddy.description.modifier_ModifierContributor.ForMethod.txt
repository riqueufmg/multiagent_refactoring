    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC = 9, number of methods (nom) = 0, weighted methods complexity (wmc) = 0, number of fields (nof) = 1. It has no fan-in or fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and no dependencies. Given the minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
