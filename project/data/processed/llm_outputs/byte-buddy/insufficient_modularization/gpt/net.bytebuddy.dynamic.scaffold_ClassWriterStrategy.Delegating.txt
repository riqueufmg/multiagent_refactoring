    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.ClassWriterStrategy.Delegating",

    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=41, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, LCOM=-1.0 and zero fan-in/fan-out. With no methods (NOM=0), minimal state (NOF=1) and no measured complexity or coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
