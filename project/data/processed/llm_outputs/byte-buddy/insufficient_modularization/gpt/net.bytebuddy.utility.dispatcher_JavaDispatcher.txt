    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 1180) and a large number of fields (nof = 32) indicating concentrated state; high implementation complexity (wmc = 51) while having relatively few top-level methods (nom = 6), which suggests bulky/complex methods or multiple responsibilities per method. The dependency list includes many nested/inner components (JavaDispatcher.Resolver, JavaDispatcher.Dispatcher, JavaDispatcher.OfPrimitiveArray, JavaDispatcher.ForDefaultValue, JavaDispatcher.CreationAction, JavaDispatcher.NoOp, JavaDispatcher.DynamicClassLoader), which implies the class is housing many distinct roles that could be extracted. The moderate/low cohesion metric (lcom = 0.3333) further supports that behavior/state is not tightly cohesive. Taken together these elements justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
