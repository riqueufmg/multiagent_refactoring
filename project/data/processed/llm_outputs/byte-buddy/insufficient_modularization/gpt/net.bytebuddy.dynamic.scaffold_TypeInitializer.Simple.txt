    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and non-complex: LOC=40, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1, NOPM=0. Cohesion and coupling do not suggest hidden complexity (LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0). With no methods and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence the class has grown large or complex enough to require further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
