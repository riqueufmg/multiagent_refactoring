    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undivided, overly large or complex class. The class has low method count (nom = 2) and very low complexity (wmc = 2), moderate size (loc = 109) but not excessive, and a small number of fields (nof = 5). Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and cohesion is not flagged (lcom = -1.0). Although there are several external dependencies, the internal size and complexity metrics do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
