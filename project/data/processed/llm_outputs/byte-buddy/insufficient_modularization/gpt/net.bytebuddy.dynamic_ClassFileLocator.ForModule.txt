    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modular: it has a large physical size (loc = 143) while carrying state (nof = 3) and depending on multiple external components (net.bytebuddy.utility.StreamDrainer, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType). The combination of high LOC and multiple dependencies suggests multiple responsibilities or internal complexity that could be reduced by decomposition. These elements indicate a candidate for further modularization."
