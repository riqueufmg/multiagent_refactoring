    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.StreamDrainer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: 5 fields (nof) versus only 3 methods (nom) indicates an imbalance of state to behavior; size is non-trivial (loc=67) with moderate complexity (wmc=6); cohesion is reduced (lcom=0.6666666666666666), suggesting multiple responsibilities or low intra-class cohesion. These factors together justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
