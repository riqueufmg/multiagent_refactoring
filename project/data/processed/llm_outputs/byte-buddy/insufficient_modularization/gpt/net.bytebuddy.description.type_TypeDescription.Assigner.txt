    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc=427) while exposing few members (nof=7) and no methods recorded (nom=0, nopm=0). The large source size combined with zero recorded methods and a method-complexity metric of wmc=0 indicates implementation is concentrated in a single class rather than decomposed into separate methods/objects. Dependencies are limited (3), suggesting functionality is not distributed across collaborators. These indicators (high LOC, few fields, no methods) justify flagging Insufficient Modularization — the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
