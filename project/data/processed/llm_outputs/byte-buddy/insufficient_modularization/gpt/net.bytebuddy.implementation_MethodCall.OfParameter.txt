    "justification": "Class metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class: LOC=46 (small), WMC=0 and NOM=0 (no method complexity or many methods to split), NOF=2 (only two fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), dependencies are limited (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These elements show low size and low complexity, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
