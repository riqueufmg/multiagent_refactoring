    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder.DelegationProcessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class shows indicators of being insufficiently modular: relatively large size (loc = 210) combined with a high number of fields (nof = 10) while having no reported methods (nom = 0) suggests a monolithic data/behavior grouping that could be split. The class depends on many distinct concerns (Binder, Implementation, Assigner, BindingMechanic, AnnotationDescription, ParameterDescription, TypeDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), which implies multiple responsibilities are handled together. These elements (high LOC, many fields, zero methods in the metrics, and diverse dependencies) justify recommending further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
