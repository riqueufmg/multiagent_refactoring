    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ArrayProjection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modular: it contains 256 lines of code (loc = 256) while exposing only 4 fields (nof = 4) and no measured methods (nom = 0), which suggests a large implementation body that could be decomposed. It also depends on a wide set of unrelated types (AnnotationList, TypeList, RecordComponentList, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, ModuleDescription, TypeDescription, MethodList, RecordComponentDescription, StackSize, PackageDescription, FieldList) indicating multiple responsibilities and cross-cutting concerns. These factors (large size and many dependencies) indicate the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
