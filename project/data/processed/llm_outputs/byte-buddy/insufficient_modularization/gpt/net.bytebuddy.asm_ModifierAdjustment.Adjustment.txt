    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ModifierAdjustment.Adjustment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and low-complexity so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition. Metrics show LOC=37, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0 and DIT=1, indicating minimal implementation and no measured methods/complex behavior to split. Cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate fragmentation, and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although it depends on three external types, the class's size and lack of internal complexity do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
