    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=39), low cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC=2), few methods (NOM=2, NOPM=2), high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), small number of fields (NOF=3) and no outgoing dependencies (fanout=0). These values suggest the class is already small and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
