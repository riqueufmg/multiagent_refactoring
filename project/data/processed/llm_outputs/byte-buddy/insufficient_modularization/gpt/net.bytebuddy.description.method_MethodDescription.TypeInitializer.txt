    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: only 1 field (nof=1), zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0), low size (loc=70) and zero complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although there are listed type dependencies, the class itself shows low responsibility and low complexity, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
