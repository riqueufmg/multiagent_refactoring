    "justification": "The class shows no indicators of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=16), no methods reported (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), zero class complexity (nc=0). Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single listed dependency. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or many responsibilities that would suggest further decomposition is needed."
