    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity (LOC=19, WMC=0), no methods/fields indicated (nof=0, nom=0, nopm=0), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal/trivial and does not show signs that it must be further decomposed; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
