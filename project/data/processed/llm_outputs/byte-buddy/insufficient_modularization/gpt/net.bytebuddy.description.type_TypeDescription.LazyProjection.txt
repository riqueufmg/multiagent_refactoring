    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 597) and holds many fields (nof = 19), which indicates substantial implementation and state that can be split. Its dependency set references a broad range of concepts (TypeList, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, RecordComponentDescription, AnnotationSource, TypeDefinition, TypeDescription, CachedReturnPlugin), suggesting it combines responsibilities related to types, methods, fields, record components and annotations. These factors (high LOC, many fields, and diverse dependencies) justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and is a candidate for further modularization."
