    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: loc=15, nom=2 (nopm=1), wmc=2 (low complexity), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion). Fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling pressure, and dependencies are minimal. Given its low size and complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
