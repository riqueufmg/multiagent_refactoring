    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 305) combined with a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 9) while reporting no declared methods (nom = 0), indicating functionality is not decomposed into smaller methods/components. Multiple external dependencies (AnnotationValue, ParameterDescription, AnnotationList, ParameterList, TypeList, MethodDescription, MethodNameTransformer, TypeDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) suggest the class handles several responsibilities. These factors, considered in isolation, justify refactoring to further decompose the class."
