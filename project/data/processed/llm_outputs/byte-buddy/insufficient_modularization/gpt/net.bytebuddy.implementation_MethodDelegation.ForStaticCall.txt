    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.ForStaticCall",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not sufficiently complex to indicate Insufficient Modularization: 34 LOC, only 1 field (nof=1), no methods reported (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0) and depth of inheritance is 0 (dit=0). Given these metrics and the listed dependencies, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
