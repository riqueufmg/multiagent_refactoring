    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small surface area (nof=2 fields, nom=0 methods), moderate size (loc=87) but zero measured complexity (wmc=0), no parents/children complexity (dit=0, nc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). With no methods and minimal fields, there is no evidence that the class holds multiple responsibilities or high implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
