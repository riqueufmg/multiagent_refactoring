    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.Dispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high LOC (134) while reporting very few declared members (nof = 2, nom = 0), which suggests large blocks of code (long methods or procedural code) that have not been decomposed into smaller methods/classes. The class also depends on multiple distinct external concerns (7 listed dependencies: net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeValidation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.ConstructorStrategy), indicating it may be handling multiple responsibilities. Cohesion metric is unavailable/ambiguous (lcom = -1.0), so the combination of large size and wide dependency surface supports that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
