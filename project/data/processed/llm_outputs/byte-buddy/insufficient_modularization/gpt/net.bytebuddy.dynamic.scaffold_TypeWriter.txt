    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits strong signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (LOC = 4701) and a very high number of fields (nof = 150) indicate a bulky implementation that likely mixes many responsibilities. The class has very few top-level methods (nom = 2) but many inner/related types referenced (TypeWriter.ForClass, ForInterface, ForAnnotation, ForRecord, ForModuleType, ForPackageType, ForInlining, ForDefinedMethod, FieldPool, MethodPool, RecordComponentPool, FrameWriter, InitializationHandler, Dispatcher, ContextRegistry, ClassDumpAction, WithDrain/WithoutDrain/Disabled/Expanding/Sort etc.), which suggests the file contains many nested components and varied responsibilities that could be split into separate classes. Together these metrics (high LOC, high field count, many embedded responsibilities shown by numerous TypeWriter.* dependencies) justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
