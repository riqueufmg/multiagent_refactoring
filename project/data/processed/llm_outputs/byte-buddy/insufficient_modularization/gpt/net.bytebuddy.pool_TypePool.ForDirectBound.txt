    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (loc = 11), no methods (nom = 0) and no fields, zero complexity (wmc = 0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and no dependencies. Considering the class in isolation, these metrics indicate it is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
