    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.FieldAccess",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc=191) while exposing only few methods (nom=4, nopm=3) — implying large method bodies and concentrated functionality. It holds multiple fields (nof=6) and a low cohesion metric (lcom=0.75), indicating that fields and methods are not tightly related and the class likely mixes responsibilities. The presence of an internal/nested type (FieldAccess.Defined) and dependencies spanning different concerns (FieldDescription, EnumerationDescription, StackManipulation, StackSize) further suggests multiple roles (field resolution/definition, enum handling, stack manipulation) are combined. These factors justify decomposing the class into smaller, more cohesive components to reduce size and complexity."
