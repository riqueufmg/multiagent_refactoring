    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=19), no fields (nof=0) and no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Only a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription) is listed. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
