    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: modest size (loc=69), zero methods (nom=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0) — no large method bodies to decompose; a moderate number of fields (nof=6) but no evidence of high cohesion problems (lcom=-1.0, which does not indicate fragmentation here); low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (dit=1). The dependency list is limited. These elements do not support detecting Insufficient Modularization."
