    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=22), has a single field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0), no measured complexity (wmc=0, nc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low size and complexity metrics and minimal dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) do not indicate a need for further decomposition."
