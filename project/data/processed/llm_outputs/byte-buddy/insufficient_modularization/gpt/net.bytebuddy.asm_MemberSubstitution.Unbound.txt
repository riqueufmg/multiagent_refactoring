    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=28, 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), WMC=0. Coupling and interaction are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is 0 (dit=0). LCOM is not indicating cohesion problems (lcom=-1.0). Given its small size, zero method complexity, and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence that it is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
