    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, high-complexity class: LOC is modest (68), WMC = 0 and NOM = 0 show no method-level complexity to decompose, fanin and fanout are 0 (no coupling suggesting a large mixed-responsibility class), and only 3 fields with a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). LCOM = -1.0 (no cohesion concerns reported) further supports that there is no clear evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
