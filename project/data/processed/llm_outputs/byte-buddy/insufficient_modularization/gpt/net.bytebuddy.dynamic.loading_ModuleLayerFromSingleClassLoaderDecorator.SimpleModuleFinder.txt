    "justification": "Metrics show a small, low-complexity class: loc=30, nom=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods to further decompose (nom=0) and coupling is minimal. No indicators of high complexity or multiple responsibilities are present, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
