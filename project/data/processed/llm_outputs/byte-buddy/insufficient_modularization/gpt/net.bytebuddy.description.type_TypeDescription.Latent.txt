    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is relatively large (loc = 172) while referencing many distinct concerns (dependencies include TypeList, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, ModuleDescription, RecordComponentDescription, TypeDescription, AnnotationSource, PackageDescription). It has 4 fields (nof = 4) but shows no decomposed methods (nom = 0) in the provided metrics, suggesting logic and responsibilities are concentrated rather than split across smaller units. The combination of substantial size and broad set of dependencies indicates multiple responsibilities that could be separated to reduce size and complexity, consistent with Insufficient Modularization."
