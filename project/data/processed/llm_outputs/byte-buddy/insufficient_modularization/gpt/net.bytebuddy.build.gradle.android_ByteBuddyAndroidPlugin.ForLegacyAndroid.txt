    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.ForLegacyAndroid",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=40), no fields or methods recorded (nof=0, nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one listed dependency. These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
