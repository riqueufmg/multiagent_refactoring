    "justification": "Class is small and has no behavioral content to decompose: LOC=34, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, NC=0) and there are no methods to split into smaller responsibilities. Given these metrics and treating the class in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
