    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription.Token",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc=197) and holds a relatively high number of fields (nof=9) while depending on multiple distinct abstractions (AnnotationValue, ParameterDescription, AnnotationList, TypeList, TypeDescription, ByteCodeElement). These facts indicate it aggregates several different responsibilities (annotations, parameters, types, byte-code related state) inside a single unit. Although method metrics are not populated (nom=0, wmc=0), the substantial LOC combined with multiple fields and diverse dependencies suggests the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split into smaller, more focused types to reduce size and implementation complexity. The class is defined inside MethodDescription.java, reinforcing that it likely encapsulates multiple concerns that can be modularized."
