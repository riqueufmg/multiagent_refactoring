    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=31, NOM=3, WMC=5 and only NOF=1 indicate limited size and complexity. LCOM=0.0 suggests high cohesion. DIT=0 and fanin/fanout=0 indicate low coupling and no deep inheritance. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class should be further decomposed."
