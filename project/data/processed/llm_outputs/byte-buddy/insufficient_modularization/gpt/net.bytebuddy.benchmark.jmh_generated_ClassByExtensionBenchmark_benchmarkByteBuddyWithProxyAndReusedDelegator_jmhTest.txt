    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected based on the class's internal metrics: extremely large number of fields (nof = 263) while having few methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8), substantial size (loc = 276) and high cyclomatic/maintenance complexity (wmc = 42). The imbalance between fields and methods and the overall LOC/WMC indicate the class contains many responsibilities/data and implementation complexity that could be decomposed. fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show the class is self-contained, reinforcing that the complexity resides inside the single class rather than being split out. These elements together justify Insufficient Modularization."
