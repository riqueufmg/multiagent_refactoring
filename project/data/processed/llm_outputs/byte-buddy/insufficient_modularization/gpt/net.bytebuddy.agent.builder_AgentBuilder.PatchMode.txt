    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.PatchMode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: number of fields (nof=3) and number of methods (nom=0) are very small, cyclomatic complexity/weight (wmc=0) is minimal, and coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LOC is 192, the absence of methods and low complexity/coupling suggest the class is small in behavioural surface and self-contained. LCOM is -1.0 (not applicable), and dependencies are limited, so there is no evidence from the provided metrics that the class should be further decomposed."
