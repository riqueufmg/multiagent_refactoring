    "justification": "Class size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization: loc=62 (moderate size) with nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods/low complexity), nof=2 (only two fields) and fanin=0/fanout=0 (low coupling). Dependencies are minimal (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Given the absence of methods and low complexity/coupling, there is no evidence this class needs further decomposition."
