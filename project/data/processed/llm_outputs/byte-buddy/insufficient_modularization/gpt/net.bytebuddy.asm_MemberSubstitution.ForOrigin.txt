    "justification": "The class is large and tightly coupled: loc=266 (high size) with nof=6 fields and a sizeable dependency list (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType). Method-level metrics are non-informative (nom=0, wmc=0) and cohesion is not reported (lcom=-1.0), which together with the large LOC and multiple external dependencies suggests the class likely contains multiple responsibilities and would benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
