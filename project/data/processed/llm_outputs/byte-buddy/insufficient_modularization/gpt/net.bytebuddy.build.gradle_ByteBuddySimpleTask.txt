    "justification": "The class does not show clear signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=105 and WMC=15 indicate moderate size/complexity rather than an overly large class; NOM=14 is modest and NOPM=10 does not imply an excessive public surface in isolation; LCOM=0.2857142857142857 indicates good cohesion (methods are related); NOF=4 and NOPF=0 show a small number of fields with no public fields; FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 suggest low coupling to/from other types in the provided data; DIT=1 and NC=0 show little inheritance complexity. Given these metrics in isolation, further decomposition is not clearly warranted."
