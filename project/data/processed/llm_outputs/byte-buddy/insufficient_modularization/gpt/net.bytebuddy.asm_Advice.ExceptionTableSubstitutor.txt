    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=65, NOM=0, WMC=0. It has very low coupling and usage (fanin=0, fanout=0, single external dependency), and no measurable internal method complexity to decompose. Given the absence of methods/complex logic to split and the low size and coupling, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
