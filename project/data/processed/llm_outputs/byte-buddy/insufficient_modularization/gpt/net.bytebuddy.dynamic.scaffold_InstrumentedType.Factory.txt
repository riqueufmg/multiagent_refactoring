    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=51, nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion issues to decompose. Although there are external type dependencies listed, the class itself shows no methods, fields, or internal complexity that would benefit from further decomposition, so it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
