    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has large size (loc = 481) and a high number of fields (nof = 22), indicating substantial implementation volume. It depends on many distinct external types (13 listed dependencies: InstrumentedType, MethodGraph, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, MethodList, ElementMatcher, TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder, FieldLocator, StackManipulation, MethodDelegationBinder, Duplication), suggesting multiple responsibilities or concerns. These factors (high LOC, many fields, and many dependency relationships) are consistent with an incompletely decomposed class and support detection of Insufficient Modularization."
