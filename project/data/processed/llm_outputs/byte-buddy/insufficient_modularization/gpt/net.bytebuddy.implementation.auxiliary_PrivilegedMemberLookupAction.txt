    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.PrivilegedMemberLookupAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: size is modest (LOC=103) with a small method count (nom=5, public methods nopm=3) and few fields (nof=4). Complexity is moderate (WMC=9) and cohesion is acceptable (LCOM=0.4), indicating related responsibilities. Low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1) further suggest the class is reasonably self-contained and not a large, undecomposed unit. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to mark this class as needing further decomposition."
