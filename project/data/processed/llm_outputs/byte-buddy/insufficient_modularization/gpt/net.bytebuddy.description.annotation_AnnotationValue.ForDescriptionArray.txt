    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForDescriptionArray",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 266) while exposing no methods (nom = 0) and zero measured complexity (wmc = 0). This combination indicates substantial code volume without method-level decomposition. It also defines several fields (nof = 5) and depends on multiple types (TypeDescription, AnnotationValue, CachedReturnPlugin, MethodDescription), suggesting multiple responsibilities or embedded behavior. These metrics (high LOC with nom=0/wmc=0) are consistent with Insufficient Modularization: the class appears not sufficiently decomposed and would likely benefit from splitting behavior into smaller methods/classes to reduce size and complexity."
