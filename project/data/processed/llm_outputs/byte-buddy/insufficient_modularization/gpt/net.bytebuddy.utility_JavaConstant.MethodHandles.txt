    "justification": "Metrics show the class is very small and simple: LOC=28, WMC=0, nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0), DIT=0, and LCOM=-1 (not indicating cohesion problems). Only a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Given the lack of size, methods, complexity, or coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular and in need of further decomposition."
