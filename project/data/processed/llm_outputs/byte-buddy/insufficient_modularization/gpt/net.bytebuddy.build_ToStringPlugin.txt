    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: moderate size (loc=94) with a small number of methods (nom=4, nopm=4), low complexity (wmc=5), high cohesion (lcom=1.0), and only 3 fields (nof=3). There are no signs of excessive coupling or responsibility (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no indication of many nested elements (nc=0). Given these values and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it must be further decomposed to reduce size or complexity."
