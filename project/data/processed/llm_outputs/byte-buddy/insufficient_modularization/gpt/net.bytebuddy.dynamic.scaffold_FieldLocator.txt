    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High class size with few decomposed units: LOC=297 while number of methods (nom)=2 and WMC=2 indicates very large method bodies rather than many small, focused methods. The class declares multiple fields (nof=5) and includes nested types referenced in its dependencies (FieldLocator.Illegal, FieldLocator.Resolution), suggesting multiple responsibilities are bundled into this single type. The combination of large file size and minimal method decomposition supports a conclusion of insufficient modularization."
