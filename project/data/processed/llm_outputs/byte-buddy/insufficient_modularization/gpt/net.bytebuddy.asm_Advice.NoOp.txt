    "justification": "Class is small and lacks indicators of an undecomposed design: LOC = 13, number of methods (nom) = 0, number of fields (nof) = 0, weighted method count (wmc) = 0, fan-in = 0, fan-out = 0. Given the absence of methods/fields, low size and zero complexity metrics, there is no evidence in the provided data that the class should be further decomposed."
