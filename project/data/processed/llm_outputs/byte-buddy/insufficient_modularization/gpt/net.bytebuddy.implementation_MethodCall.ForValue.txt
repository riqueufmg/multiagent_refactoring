    "justification": "Class has moderate size (loc=81) while defining multiple fields (nof=5) but no declared methods (nom=0), indicating data and behavior are not cleanly separated. The class depends on a heterogeneous set of types (Implementation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Assigner, FieldDescription, TypeDescription, StackManipulation), suggesting multiple responsibilities (type description, assignment, bytecode manipulation, equality/hash handling) are combined. These elements (loc=81, nof=5, nom=0, and the diverse dependencies) justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
