    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.DefaultValueSkip",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the source has 152 LOC, the class shows no methods (nom=0) and no measured cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0). It has only 4 fields (nof=4), minimal inheritance depth (dit=1), and no incoming/outgoing dependencies recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate internal implementation complexity or size concentrated in executable code that would suggest the class is insufficiently modularized."
