    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithPrefixAndReusedDelegatorWithTypePool_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large state size (nof = 263) and substantial implementation size (loc = 276) while containing a relatively small number of methods (nom = 9). Its implementation complexity is also elevated (wmc = 42). These metrics indicate a concentration of state and complexity in a single class that could be split into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity. Additional supporting indicators: no child decomposition reported (nc = 0) and no external coupling metrics (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) in the provided data, suggesting the class itself contains the bulk of functionality and should be decomposed."
