    "justification": "No evidence of insufficient modularization: although LOC = 75, the class has nom = 0 and wmc = 0 (no methods/complexity), only nof = 4 fields, fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no coupling), and a small set of dependencies. LCOM = -1.0 is inconclusive. Overall metrics show no high complexity, large method count, or high coupling that would indicate the class should be decomposed further."
