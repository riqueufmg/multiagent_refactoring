    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.StringMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small number of methods (nom=3, nopm=2) and low cyclomatic/weight (wmc=3) imply limited behavioral complexity, high cohesion (lcom=0.0) shows methods work on shared state, and no inheritance/fan coupling (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LOC=132 is moderate, the low method count and low WMC indicate the class is not carrying multiple independent responsibilities that warrant decomposition."
