    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large, complex, or highly coupled class that needs decomposition: LOC is 93 but the class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only 4 fields (nof=4), WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 and a single dependency. LCOM is not indicating cohesion problems. Given the absence of method complexity, high coupling, or many responsibilities in the provided data, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
