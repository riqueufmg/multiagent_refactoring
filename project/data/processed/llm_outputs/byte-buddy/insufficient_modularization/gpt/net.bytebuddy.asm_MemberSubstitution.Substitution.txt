    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Substitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 4607) indicating a monolithic implementation; an extremely high number of fields (nof = 215) implying many responsibilities or accumulated state that could be split into smaller collaborating types; references a wide set of external types (22 distinct dependencies) suggesting high coupling and multiple concerns; anomalous method metrics (nom = 0, wmc = 0) combined with the large LOC suggest implementation is not decomposed into reasonable methods/units. Taken in isolation, these elements justify that the class should be further decomposed to reduce size, complexity, and improve modularity."
