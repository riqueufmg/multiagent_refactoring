    "detection": false,
    "justification": "In isolation, the class shows no signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=38), very low complexity (WMC=0), no methods to decompose (nom=0), only two fields (nof=2), and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition."
