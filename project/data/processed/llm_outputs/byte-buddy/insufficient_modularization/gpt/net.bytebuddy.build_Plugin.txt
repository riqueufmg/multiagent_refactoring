    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 4286), a high number of members (nof = 116) and many nested/related types (nc = 28) such as ArgumentResolver, Origin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Unresolved, Resolution, Failing, Listener, Source, PoolStrategy, Default, Dispatcher, Factory, WithThrowawayExecutorService, NoOp, ForParallelTransformation, Sink, Materializable, ForSerialTransformation, Enforcing, TypeStrategy, Instantiator, NoFolderMatcher, Target, Empty, ErrorHandler, Element, etc. Despite this, it reports only nom = 1 (single/main method), indicating functionality is spread across many inner components within the same class file. The wide variety of dependencies (ElementMatcher, DynamicType, TypePool, ByteBuddy, ClassFileVersion, ClassFileLocator, etc.) suggests multiple responsibilities. Together these facts indicate the class has not been decomposed sufficiently and would benefit from further modularization."
