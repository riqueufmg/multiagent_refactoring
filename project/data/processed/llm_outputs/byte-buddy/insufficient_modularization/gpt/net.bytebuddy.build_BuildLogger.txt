    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.BuildLogger",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc=478) with a non-trivial number of methods (nom=12) indicates concentrated functionality that could be split; combined with moderate overall complexity (wmc=12) and high LOC this suggests long or complex method bodies that would benefit from decomposition. The class has no inheritance (dit=0) and zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0), meaning it is an isolated, self-contained unit likely carrying multiple responsibilities rather than delegating them. LCOM=-1.0 does not provide evidence of high cohesion to counter decomposition. Dependency list is minimal (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), so behavior is not already factored out elsewhere. These elements together justify recommending further decomposition."
