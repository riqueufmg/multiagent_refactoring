    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=79, NOF=3, NOM=0, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0. It has no methods (NOM=0) and zero measured complexity (WMC=0), with no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of fields and minimal dependencies also suggest a single, cohesive responsibility rather than an undivided, overly large class. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
