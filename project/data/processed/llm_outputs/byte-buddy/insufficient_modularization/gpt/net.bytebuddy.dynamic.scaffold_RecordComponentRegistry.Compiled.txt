    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class: LOC is moderate (76), number of fields is small (5), there are no methods reported (nom=0, wmc=0) and complexity is low. Fan-in/fan-out are 0 and LCOM is not indicating cohesion problems (lcom=-1.0 likely unmeasured). Dependencies are external and do not imply high internal responsibility. Therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
