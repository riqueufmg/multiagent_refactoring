    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LOC = 190 (large class file size) and NOF = 11 (many fields) indicate substantial internal content/state that could be split. NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 despite high LOC suggest the class body contains substantial non-method code (long initializers, inner types, or mixed responsibilities) rather than a focused set of operations, which is a sign it has not been fully decomposed. The dependency set spans varied concerns (LatentMatcher, ElementMatcher, FieldAttributeAppender, Transformer, TypeDescription, etc.), implying the class touches multiple responsibilities. Together these elements justify that the class likely suffers from Insufficient Modularization and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
