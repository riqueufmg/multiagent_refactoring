    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Illegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and contains minimal implementation: LOC=28, number of fields (nof)=1, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method complexity (wmc)=0. It shows no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (dit=0). Given the low size and complexity metrics, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed or would benefit from further modularization."
