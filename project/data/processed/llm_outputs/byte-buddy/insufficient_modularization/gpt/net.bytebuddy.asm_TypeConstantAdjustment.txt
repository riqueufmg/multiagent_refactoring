    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeConstantAdjustment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=84, WMC=3, NOM=3. It has low coupling and usage (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion between methods, the overall size and low complexity do not indicate a clear need for further decomposition; the small number of methods and fields (NOF=4) mean splitting is unlikely to reduce implementation complexity or size."
