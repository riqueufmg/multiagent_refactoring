    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=25 (small size), NOM=0 and NOPM=0 (no methods to decompose), WMC=0 (no implementation complexity), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 with no dependencies (no external coupling). LCOM=-1.0 is non-applicable/neutral here. There is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would indicate Insufficient Modularization."
