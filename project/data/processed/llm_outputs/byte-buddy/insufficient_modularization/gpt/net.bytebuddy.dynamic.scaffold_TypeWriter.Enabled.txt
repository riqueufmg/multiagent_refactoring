    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Enabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and non-complex: LOC=33, NOF=2, NOM=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. It has no methods and minimal fields, and only a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate low size and implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
