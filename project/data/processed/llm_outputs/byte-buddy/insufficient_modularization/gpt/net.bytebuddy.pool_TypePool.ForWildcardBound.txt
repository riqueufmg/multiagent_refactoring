    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForWildcardBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC is small (56), there are no methods (nom = 0) and no measured complexity (wmc = 0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. Coupling is low (fanout = 0, fanin = 0) and dependencies are limited. Although it has 5 fields (nof = 5), the absence of methods and low complexity do not justify treating this class as insufficiently modularized."
