{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveNarrowingDelegate.NarrowingStackManipulation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=31, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, and only 2 fields (nof=2). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has a short dependency list. These metrics indicate low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
