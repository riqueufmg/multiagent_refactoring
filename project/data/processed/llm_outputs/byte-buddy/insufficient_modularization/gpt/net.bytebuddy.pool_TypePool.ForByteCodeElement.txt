    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=53, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=3. Coupling is negligible (fanin=0, fanout=0). There are no methods to decompose (nom=0) and complexity is minimal, so there is no evidence of an undivided, overly large or complex implementation that would indicate Insufficient Modularization."
