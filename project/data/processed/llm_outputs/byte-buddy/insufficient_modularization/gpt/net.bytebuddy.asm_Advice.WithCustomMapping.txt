    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithCustomMapping",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 551) which strongly suggests it contains multiple responsibilities that could be split. It has only 4 fields (nof = 4) despite the large size, implying much of the complexity is implemented in a monolithic body rather than decomposed into smaller collaborating classes. The provided metrics show no reported methods (nom = 0) and wmc = 0, which—combined with the high LOC—indicates either very large methods or internal complexity not modularized. Cohesion indicator (lcom = -1.0) and zero fan-in/fan-out further imply the class is isolated but bulky. The wide range of dependencies (e.g., AnnotationValue, ParameterDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, ClassFileLocator, JavaConstant, MethodGraph, AsmClassReader) indicates the class touches many concerns (types, methods, annotations, class file access), supporting that it handles multiple responsibilities that would benefit from decomposition. For these reasons, this class exhibits Insufficient Modularization."
