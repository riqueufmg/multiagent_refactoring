    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, non-complex class: LOC=18, WMC=0, no fields or methods (nof=0, nom=0), fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicating low coupling. DIT=2 only reflects inheritance depth and LCOM=-1.0 is not meaningful for an empty class. Given its minimal size and lack of internal complexity, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
