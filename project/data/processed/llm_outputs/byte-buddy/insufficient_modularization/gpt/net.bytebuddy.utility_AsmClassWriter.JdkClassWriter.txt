    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.JdkClassWriter",

    "justification": "Class has small size and trivial structure: LOC=34, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Only a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex and does not show signs of needing further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
