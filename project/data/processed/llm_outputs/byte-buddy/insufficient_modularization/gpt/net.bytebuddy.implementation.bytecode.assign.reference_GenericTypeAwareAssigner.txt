    "justification": "High file size with few methods: loc=360 while nom=1 and nopm=1 indicates a single large method concentrating implementation. Coupled with nof=5 (several fields) this suggests substantial behavior and state are contained in one class/method rather than decomposed. WMC=4 shows limited measured complexity but that complexity is localized in the single method; DIT=1 and nc=0 indicate a shallow hierarchy where decomposition into smaller helper methods or classes would reduce size and improve modularity. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
