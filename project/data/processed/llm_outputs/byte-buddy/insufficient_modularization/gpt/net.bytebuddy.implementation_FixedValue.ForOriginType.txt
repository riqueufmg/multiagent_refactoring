    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.ForOriginType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no sign of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=59), very low structural complexity (wmc=0), no declared methods (nom=0) and only one field (nof=1) which limits internal responsibility. Cohesion metric indicates good cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0). Depth of inheritance is modest (dit=2). Given these metrics and the listed dependencies, there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
