    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed, high-complexity class: although LOC = 122, the class shows no measured method complexity (wmc = 0), no reported methods (nom = 0), a small number of fields (nof = 5), low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and an LCOM value indicating cohesion (lcom = -1.0). The dependency list is limited. Taken in isolation, these elements do not support that the class is excessively large or has multiple responsibilities that would require further decomposition."
