    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ClassLoaderCreationAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity: LOC=22, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. These metrics indicate minimal implementation content and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or would benefit from further decomposition."
