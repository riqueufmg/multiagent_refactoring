    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC is moderate (112) but there are no methods (nom = 0) and WMC = 0, indicating no measurable internal complexity or many responsibilities to split. The class has only 2 fields (nof = 2), zero fan-in and fan-out, and LCOM = -1.0 (no evidence of low cohesion given no methods). In isolation, there is insufficient evidence of size or complexity that would justify further decomposition."
