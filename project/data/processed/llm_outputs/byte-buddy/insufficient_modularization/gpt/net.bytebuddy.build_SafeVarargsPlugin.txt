    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=60), low method count (nom=4, nopm=4), low complexity (WMC=4) and high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating limited responsibilities and interactions. Although an inner helper (SafeVarargsAppender) is referenced, the class is small and cohesive, so there is no evidence it should be further decomposed."
