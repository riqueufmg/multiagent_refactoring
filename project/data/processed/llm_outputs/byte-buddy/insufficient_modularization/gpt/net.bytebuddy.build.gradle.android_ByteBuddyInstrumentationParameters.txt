    "justification": "Class appears small and cohesive so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization. Metrics: loc=25, nom=4, wmc=4 (low complexity), fanout=0 and fanin=0 (no significant coupling), dependencies list contains a single reference (org.gradle.api.tasks.PathSensitivity), lcom=-1.0 (no indication of low cohesion). These values indicate the class is compact and not a candidate for further decomposition in isolation."
