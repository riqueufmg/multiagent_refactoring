    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.BuildLogger.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of needing further decomposition: it has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 weighted method complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (dit=1), and a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although LOC is 155, the absence of methods/complexity and minimal coupling indicate it is not suffering from Insufficient Modularization."
