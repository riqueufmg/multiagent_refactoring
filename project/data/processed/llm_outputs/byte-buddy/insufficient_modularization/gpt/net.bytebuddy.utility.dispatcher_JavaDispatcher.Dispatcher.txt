    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.Dispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 501) combined with a relatively high number of fields (nof = 15) indicates substantial internal implementation that could be split. There are no reported methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0) despite the large LOC, suggesting implementation is not decomposed into smaller behaviors. Cohesion metric is non-positive (lcom = -1.0), which does not indicate strong cohesion. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, implying the complexity is internal to the class rather than distributed. Together these elements (loc=501, nof=15, nom=0, wmc=0, lcom=-1.0) justify detection of Insufficient Modularization."
