    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No. Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=43), no methods (NOM=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 appears not applicable. There is no evidence here that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
