    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=39, 1 field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0), WMC=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), DIT=1, LCOM=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0. Low size, zero method complexity and no coupling indicate the class is already minimal in this isolated view; there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
