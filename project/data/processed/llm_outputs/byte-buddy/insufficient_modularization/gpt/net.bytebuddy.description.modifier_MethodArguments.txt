    "justification": "High lack of cohesion (LCOM=0.8) indicates the methods are not well related; the class has 5 methods (nom=5) but only 1 field (nof=1), and 4 non-private/public methods (nopm=4), suggesting multiple independent responsibilities grouped together; moderate complexity and size (WMC=5, LOC=46) means decomposition could reduce implementation complexity and size; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show the class is self-contained, so splitting it would not increase external coupling."
