    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=28, number of fields (nof)=1, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted methods complexity (wmc)=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric indicates no cohesion problem (lcom=-1.0). Only a single external dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate the class is already low in size and complexity, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
