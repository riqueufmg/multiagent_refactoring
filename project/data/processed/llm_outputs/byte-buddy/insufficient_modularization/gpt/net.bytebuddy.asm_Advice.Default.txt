    "justification": "Class size and complexity are low: LOC=42, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0. There are no fields or methods to decompose (NOPF=0, NOPM=0) and coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics the class does not exhibit the large size or high implementation complexity that would indicate Insufficient Modularization."
