    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and has no signs of being insufficiently modular. Metrics show LOC=35, NOF=0, NOM=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and a single dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). There are no methods or fields to decompose and complexity is zero; LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion data not applicable. These elements do not support a diagnosis of Insufficient Modularization."
