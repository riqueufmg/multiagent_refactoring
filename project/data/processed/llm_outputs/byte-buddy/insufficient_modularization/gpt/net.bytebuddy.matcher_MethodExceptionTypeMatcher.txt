    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.MethodExceptionTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=26), low number of methods (nom=3, nopm=2), low complexity (wmc=3), single field (nof=1), high cohesion (lcom=0.0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is small, cohesive and not overly complex, so there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
