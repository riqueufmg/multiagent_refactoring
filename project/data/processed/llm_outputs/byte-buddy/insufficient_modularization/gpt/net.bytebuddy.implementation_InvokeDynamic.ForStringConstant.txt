    "justification": "Class is small and already simple: LOC = 28, number of methods (nom) = 0, weighted methods complexity (wmc) = 0, number of fields (nof) = 1. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only three external dependencies are listed. These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex and does not appear to require further decomposition."
