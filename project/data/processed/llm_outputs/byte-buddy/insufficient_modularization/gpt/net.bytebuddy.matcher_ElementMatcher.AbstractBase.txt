    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=18), no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and contains no internal complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The LCOM value (-1.0) is non-informative and does not contradict this assessment."
