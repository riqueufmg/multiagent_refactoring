    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC = 72 (small), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods/complexity to split), NOF = 1 (single field), LCOM = -1.0 (no cohesion concern), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (low coupling). Given the absence of methods and low complexity/size, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
