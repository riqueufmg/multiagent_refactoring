    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class: loc=93 but nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods and no measured complexity), nof=4 (only four fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), and only one listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). There is no evidence of high cyclomatic complexity, many responsibilities, or heavy coupling that would justify further decomposition in isolation."
