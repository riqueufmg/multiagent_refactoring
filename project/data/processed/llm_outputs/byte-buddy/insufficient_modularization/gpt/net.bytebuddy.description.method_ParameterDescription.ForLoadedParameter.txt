    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 407) and a substantial number of fields (nof = 15) indicate it contains a lot of code and state that could be split. Its dependency set (AnnotationList, JavaDispatcher, ParameterList, MethodDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, AccessControllerPlugin) spans multiple concerns (annotations, dispatching, parameter/method/type description and build plugins), suggesting mixed responsibilities. These elements together justify that the class should be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
