    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=28, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, NOPM=0. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0) and inheritance depth is nil (DIT=0). LCOM is -1 (not indicating cohesion issues). Given the very low size, complexity, and coupling metrics, there is no evidence the class has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
