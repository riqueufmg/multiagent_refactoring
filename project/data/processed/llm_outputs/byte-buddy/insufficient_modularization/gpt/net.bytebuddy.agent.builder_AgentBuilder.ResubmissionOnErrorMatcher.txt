    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ResubmissionOnErrorMatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 165) combined with a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 7) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and zero WMC (wmc = 0). This mix suggests responsibilities are concentrated in fields/initialization rather than decomposed into smaller methods or collaborating classes. Additionally, zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and no recorded cohesion data (lcom = -1.0) indicate the class is isolated and likely carries multiple concerns internally, supporting the need for further decomposition."
