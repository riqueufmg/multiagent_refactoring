    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not overly complex: LOC=65, NOM=4, WMC=4, NOF=2, NOPM=2. Cohesion (LCOM=0.5) is moderate but not low enough to require decomposition. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, showing no coupling pressure that would motivate splitting. Given the low size and complexity in isolation, there is no clear evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
