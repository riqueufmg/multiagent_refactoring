    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=23, NOM=2, WMC=2, LCOM=0.0. There are no nested types (NC=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). Low size and complexity and high cohesion indicate no need for further decomposition; fan-in=0 and fan-out=0 show no coupling pressure that would motivate splitting."
