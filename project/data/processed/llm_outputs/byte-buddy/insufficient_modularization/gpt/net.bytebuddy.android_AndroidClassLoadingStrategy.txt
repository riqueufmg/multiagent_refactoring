    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class appears insufficiently modularized: it is very large (loc = 654) while exposing very few top-level methods (nom = 3), which indicates long/monolithic method bodies. It also has a high number of fields (nof = 29), suggesting multiple responsibilities or state groups. The dependency list shows many inner/nested types (Conversion, FileProcessor, ForLegacyVm, Disabled, DexProcessor, Dispatcher), implying the file bundles multiple distinct behaviors that could be split into separate classes. Although LCOM = 0 indicates cohesion, the combination of very large size (LOC), many fields, and multiple embedded components (inner classes) supports refactoring into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity and to improve maintainability."
