    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no decomposable behavior: LOC = 13, NOM = 0, NOF = 0, WMC = 0. Low coupling and trivial interactions: fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dependencies = []. Shallow hierarchy: DIT = 1. With no methods or fields to factor out, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
