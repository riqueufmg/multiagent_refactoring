    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=46, no methods (nom=0), low complexity (WMC=0), and only 2 fields (NOF=2). Coupling metrics show no inbound or outbound coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is -1.0 (no cohesion problem reported). These indicators show the class is not large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
