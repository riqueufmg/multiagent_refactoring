    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate low size and complexity: LOC=83, WMC=0, NOM=0, no fields/methods requiring decomposition (NOF=1, NOPF=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. Given the lack of methods/complex logic and minimal coupling, there is insufficient evidence that the class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
