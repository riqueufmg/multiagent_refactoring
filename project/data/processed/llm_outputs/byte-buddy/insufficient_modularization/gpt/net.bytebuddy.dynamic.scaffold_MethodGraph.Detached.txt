    "justification": "No evidence of Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=30), no methods (nom=0), low complexity (wmc=0), single field (nof=1), zero coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only one external dependency. These metrics indicate the class is minimal and not a large undecomposed unit that would benefit from further decomposition."
