    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner.OfSimpleType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "In isolation the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC is modest (61), there are no methods or measurable complexity (nom=0, wmc=0), cohesion metric is not indicating internal fragmentation (lcom=-1.0), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, only two external type dependencies). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition."
