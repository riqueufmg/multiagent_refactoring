    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Source",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 956) with a non-trivial number of features (nof = 28). Despite missing/zero values for some complexity metrics (wmc = 0, nom = 0), the high LOC alone indicates the implementation contains substantial code that can be decomposed. The class also references multiple external concerns (dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The cohesion indicator (lcom = -1.0) is not positively high and does not contradict the likelihood of low cohesion. Together these elements justify that the class has Insufficient Modularization and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, focused modules."
