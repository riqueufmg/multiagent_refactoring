    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: very small size (loc=24), no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=2 only indicates inheritance depth and does not imply excessive size or complexity. These elements show the class is minimal and does not require further decomposition."
