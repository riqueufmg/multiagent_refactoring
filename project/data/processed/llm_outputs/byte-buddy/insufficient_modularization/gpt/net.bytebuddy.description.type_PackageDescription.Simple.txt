    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and not complex. Metrics show loc=28, nof=1, nom=0, nopm=0 and wmc=0 indicating no methods and no cyclomatic complexity to decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems. These elements do not justify Insufficient Modularization."
