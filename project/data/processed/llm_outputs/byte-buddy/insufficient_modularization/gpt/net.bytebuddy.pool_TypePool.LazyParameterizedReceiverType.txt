    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has 137 LOC (loc=137) while declaring zero methods (nom=0) and zero measured cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0), indicating a large implementation that is not decomposed into methods. It has a small set of fields (nof=4) but no method-level decomposition (nopm=0), and cohesion information is ambiguous (lcom=-1.0). Additionally, fanin=0 and fanout=0 with only two external dependencies imply the implementation is self-contained rather than delegated to collaborators. These elements (high LOC with nom=0/wmc=0, limited decomposition, and low dependency delegation) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
