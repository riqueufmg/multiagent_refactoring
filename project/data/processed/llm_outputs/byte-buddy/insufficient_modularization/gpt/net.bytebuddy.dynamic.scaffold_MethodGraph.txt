    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 1553) and a high number of fields (nof = 42) indicate concentrated complexity. The dependency list contains many inner/component types (Linked, Directional, Merger, Sort, Detached, ForJavaMethod, ForJVMMethod, Node, NodeList, Entry, Resolved, Unresolved, Compiler, Empty, Harmonizer, Harmonized, Key), which implies multiple distinct responsibilities implemented inside this single class. Together these metrics and the multiplicity of embedded roles suggest the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
