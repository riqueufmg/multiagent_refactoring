    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: although LOC = 109, the class has NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods/complexity to decompose), NOF = 4 (small number of fields), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (low coupling), and only a few dependencies. LCOM is not informative (-1.0). There is no evidence of high internal complexity or many responsibilities that would justify further decomposition."
