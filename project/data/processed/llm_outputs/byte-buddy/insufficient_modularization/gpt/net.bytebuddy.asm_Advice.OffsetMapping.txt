    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OffsetMapping",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 3434) and has a high member/feature count (nof = 165), which strongly indicates it groups many responsibilities. The provided dependency list references numerous unrelated types (e.g. FieldDescription, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, Assigner, JavaConstant, AnnotationDescription, etc.), suggesting the class interacts with many concerns. Together, the substantial size and broad set of dependencies point to insufficient modularization and that the class could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
