    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC = 26, NOM = 3, WMC = 3. LCOM = 0.0 indicates high cohesion. Low public surface (NOPM = 2) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence in the provided metrics that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
