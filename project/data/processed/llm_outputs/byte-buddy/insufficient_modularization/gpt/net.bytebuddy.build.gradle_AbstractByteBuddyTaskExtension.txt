    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of being too large and complex for a single unit: 360 LOC, 38 methods (nom) of which 31 are public (nopm), 16 fields (nof) and a high weighted method count (wmc = 41). The high count of public methods and fields indicates many exposed behaviors and state that could be split into smaller responsibilities. While cohesion (lcom = 0.1316) is relatively good, the absolute size and complexity metrics (LOC, nom, nopm, wmc) justify further decomposition to reduce implementation size and complexity."
