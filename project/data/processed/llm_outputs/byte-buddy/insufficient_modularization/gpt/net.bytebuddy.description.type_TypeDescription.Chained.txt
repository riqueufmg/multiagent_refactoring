    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Chained",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=28), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal state (nof=1), zero complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single external dependency. These metrics indicate the class is already small and simple and does not require further decomposition."
