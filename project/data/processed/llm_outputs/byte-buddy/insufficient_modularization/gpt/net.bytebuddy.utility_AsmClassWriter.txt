    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large implementation size (loc = 514) combined with a small number of top-level methods (nom = 2, wmc = 2) indicates the file packs substantial behavior without decomposing into separate top-level classes. The class exposes many inner/embedded responsibilities as evidenced by multiple nested types referenced in dependencies (AsmClassWriter.SuperClassResolvingJdkClassWriter, AsmClassWriter.EmptyAsmClassReader, AsmClassWriter.ForClassFileApi, AsmClassWriter.JdkClassWriter, AsmClassWriter.Default, AsmClassWriter.Factory). Having 10 fields (nof = 10) and numerous named internal variants/factories suggests multiple responsibilities are implemented inside this single class rather than modularized. These factors justify that the class suffers from Insufficient Modularization and would benefit from decomposition into smaller classes/modules."
