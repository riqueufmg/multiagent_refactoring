    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Removal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: small size (loc=64), small number of methods (nom=5), and moderate cyclomatic/complexity (wmc=8). Coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0, limited external dependencies listed), and inheritance depth is minimal (dit=1). Although LCOM=0.8 suggests a modest cohesion concern, the class size and method count are small enough that further decomposition is not clearly warranted from these metrics alone."
