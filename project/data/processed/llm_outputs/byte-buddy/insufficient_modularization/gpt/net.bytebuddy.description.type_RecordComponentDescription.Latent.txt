    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large class: LOC=66 (moderate size), NOF=4 (only 4 fields), NOM=0 and NOPM=0 (no methods to decompose), WMC=0 (no implementation complexity), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (low coupling) and only two dependencies (TypeDescription, AnnotationList). These elements provide no evidence of insufficient modularization."
