    "justification": "Metrics do not show signs of insufficient modularization: number of methods nom=0 and weighted method count wmc=0 indicate no behavioral/implementation complexity to decompose; number of fields nof=3 is small; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show minimal coupling; there is a single dependency. LOC=68 alone is not sufficient evidence of a class that has not been decomposed when there are no methods or high complexity. Therefore, based on the provided metrics considered in isolation, insufficient modularization is not detected."
