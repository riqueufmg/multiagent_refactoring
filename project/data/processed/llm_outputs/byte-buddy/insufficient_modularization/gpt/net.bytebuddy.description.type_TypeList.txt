    "justification": "Large class size (loc = 844) combined with a high number of fields (nof = 29) indicates substantial implementation content that could be split; the class exposes very few methods (nom = 3) with low measured complexity (wmc = 3), suggesting the file bundles many responsibilities or long method bodies rather than many small focused types; dependencies list multiple inner/variant types (e.g. TypeList.OfMethodExceptionTypes, TypeList.OfConstructorExceptionTypes, TypeList.OfLoadedInterfaceTypes, TypeList.Generic) which suggests multiple responsibilities are colocated and could be modularized into separate classes; despite acceptable cohesion (lcom = -1.0) and low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), the sheer LOC and number of fields justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
