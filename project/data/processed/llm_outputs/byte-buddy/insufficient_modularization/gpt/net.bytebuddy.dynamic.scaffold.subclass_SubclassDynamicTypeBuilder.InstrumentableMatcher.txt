    "justification": "Class is small and non-complex: LOC=22, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1. Low coupling and usage: fanin=0, fanout=0. Shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and no methods to decompose. Given its minimal size and lack of internal complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
