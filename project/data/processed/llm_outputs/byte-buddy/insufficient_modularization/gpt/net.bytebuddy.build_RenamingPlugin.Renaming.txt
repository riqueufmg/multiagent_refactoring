    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show no evidence of an undersized decomposition: nom=0 (no methods to split), wmc=0 (no internal complexity), nof=3 (few fields), loc=103 (moderate size but without methods), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling indicating hidden responsibilities). LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metric not applicable. Given the absence of methods and low complexity/coupling in the provided data, there is no indication of Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
