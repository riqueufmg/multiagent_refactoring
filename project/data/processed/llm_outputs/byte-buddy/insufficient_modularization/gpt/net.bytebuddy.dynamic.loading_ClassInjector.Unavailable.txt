    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=28, number of fields=1 (nof=1), number of methods=0 (nom=0), weighted methods per class WMC=0, number of children NC=0, depth of inheritance DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or many responsibilities that would suggest it should be further decomposed. Dependency list contains a single plugin reference but does not indicate internal complexity. Therefore, Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
