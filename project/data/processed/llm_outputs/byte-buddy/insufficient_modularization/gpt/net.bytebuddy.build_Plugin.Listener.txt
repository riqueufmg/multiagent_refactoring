    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Listener",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 550) while showing very few structural units (nom = 0 methods, nof = 6 fields), indicating a large monolithic implementation that has not been decomposed into smaller methods or collaborators. It is isolated (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, only one dependency listed), which makes safe decomposition more feasible. The cohesion metric is not supportive (lcom = -1.0), suggesting poor or indeterminate cohesion. These elements together (high LOC, negligible method decomposition, low coupling to others) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization and recommend decomposing the class into smaller, focused components."
