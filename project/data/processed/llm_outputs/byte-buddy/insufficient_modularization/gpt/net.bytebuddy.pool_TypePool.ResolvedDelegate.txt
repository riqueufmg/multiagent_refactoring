    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: loc=38, nof=1, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external type dependencies are listed. There are no methods or high complexity/low cohesion signals (LCOM not indicating fragmentation). Given these values and analyzing the class in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
