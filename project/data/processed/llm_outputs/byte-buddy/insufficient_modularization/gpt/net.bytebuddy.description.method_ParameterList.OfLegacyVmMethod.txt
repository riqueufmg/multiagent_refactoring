    "justification": "Class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=39), very low implementation complexity (WMC=0), no methods to decompose (NOM=0), only 3 fields (NOF=3), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and minimal dependencies. These indicators show no internal complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition when considered in isolation."
