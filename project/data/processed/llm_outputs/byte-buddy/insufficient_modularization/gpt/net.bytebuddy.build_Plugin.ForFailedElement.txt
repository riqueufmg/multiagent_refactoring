    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=35), has no methods (nom=0) and no measurable implementation complexity (wmc=0), contains only a few fields (nof=3), and shows low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single external dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). These metrics indicate no substantial size or complexity that would justify further decomposition."
