    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: loc=28, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no measured complexity), dit=1 (shallow inheritance). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are only two known types. LCOM=-1.0 and absence of methods suggest there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities that would warrant further decomposition. Therefore there is no indication of Insufficient Modularization."
