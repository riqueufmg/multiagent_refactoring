    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular. Metrics: LOC=17 (very small), WMC=0 and NOM=0 (no methods/low complexity to decompose), NOF=0 (no fields), fan-in=0 and fan-out=0 (no coupling), dependencies=[] (isolated), LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issue reported). Given the small size, zero cyclomatic/structural complexity and lack of members, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
