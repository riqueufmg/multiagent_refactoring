    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: loc=73 (moderate size), nof=3 fields only, nom=0 methods, wmc=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion problem reported), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no broad coupling), single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Given the small number of members, zero measured complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization when analysing this class in isolation."
