    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show no evidence of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=13), no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and LCOM=-1 (not applicable/trivial). The class has no internal responsibilities to further decompose, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
