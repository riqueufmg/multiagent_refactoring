    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.MethodModifierTransformer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small and simple (LOC=22), has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), only one field (nof=1), and zero complexity (wmc=0). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependency list is small. DIT=1 and LCOM=-1.0 do not suggest a need for further decomposition. These elements indicate no evidence that the class should be further modularized."
