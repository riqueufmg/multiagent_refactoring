    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 175 lines of code (loc=175) but only a single method (nom=1) and a low cyclomatic weight (wmc=1), indicating that a large portion of logic is concentrated in one method rather than split into smaller methods or helper classes. The combination of high LOC with nom=1 is a strong sign of a monolithic implementation that could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity. Additional supporting metrics: only 3 fields (nof=3) and no call relationships (fanin=0, fanout=0) — internal complexity appears concentrated rather than modularized."
