    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 434) while being a single class unit, few fields (nof = 4) but many external dependencies (e.g. AnnotationList, TypeList, RecordComponentList, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, FieldComparator, ModuleDescription, PackageDescription, RecordComponentDescription, and multiple build/utility plugins). The combination of high LOC and a broad dependency surface suggests the class is handling multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
