    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class examined in isolation shows no sign of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=9), no methods (NOM=0), a single field (NOF=1), zero complexity (WMC=0), depth of inheritance DIT=1, high cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition."
