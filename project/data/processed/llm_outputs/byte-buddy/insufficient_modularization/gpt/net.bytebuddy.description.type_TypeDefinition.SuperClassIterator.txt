    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition.SuperClassIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=42), minimal state (nof=1), no reported methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is negligible (fanin=0, fanout=0) and the only listed dependency is its outer TypeDefinition. Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it should be further decomposed."
