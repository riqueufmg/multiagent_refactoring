    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc = 54), no methods (nom = 0) and therefore no implementation complexity (wmc = 0), only one field (nof = 1), minimal coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and a short dependency list (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). lcom is not indicating cohesion problems (-1.0). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and does not require further decomposition."
