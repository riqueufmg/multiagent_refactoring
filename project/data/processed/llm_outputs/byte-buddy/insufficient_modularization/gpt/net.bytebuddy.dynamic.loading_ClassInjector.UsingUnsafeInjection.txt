    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 201) combined with no declared methods (nom = 0) and several fields (nof = 7) implies implementation is concentrated rather than decomposed into smaller units. It also lists multiple external collaborators (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeValidation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.ConstructorStrategy), which suggests multiple responsibilities that could be split. The cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) does not indicate a clear high-cohesion decomposition. Taken in isolation, these elements justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
