    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class. Although LOC = 88, the class has NOM = 0, NOF = 0, WMC = 0 and NC = 0, showing no methods, fields or internal complexity to decompose. DIT = 0 and LCOM = -1.0 (no cohesion data) and fanin/fanout = 0 indicate minimal coupling. Dependencies are limited to two types. There is no evidence in the provided metrics of excessive size, complexity, or low cohesion that would justify further decomposition."
