    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Replacement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is very large (loc = 603) and holds many fields (nof = 33), indicating substantial state and likely multiple responsibilities that could be split. The very low reported method count (nom = 0) combined with large LOC suggests implementation is monolithic rather than decomposed into smaller collaborating types or methods. The presence of multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) also implies the class touches several concerns and would benefit from decomposition."
