    "justification": "Metrics show the class is minimal and contains no internal complexity or size to decompose: LOC=13, WMC=0, NOF=0, NOM=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods, fields, or external dependencies indicated, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or could be further decomposed."
