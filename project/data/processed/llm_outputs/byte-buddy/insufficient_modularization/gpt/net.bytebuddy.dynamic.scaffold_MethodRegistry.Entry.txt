    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=59), no methods (nom=0) and low complexity (wmc=0, nc=0) imply a simple class; number of fields (nof=6) is modest and does not by itself imply multiple responsibilities; cohesion metric not indicating low cohesion (lcom=-1.0); coupling appears minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although several types are listed as dependencies, the provided coupling metrics are zero, and there is no evidence in the isolated data of high implementation complexity or multiple responsibilities that would warrant further decomposition."
