    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted method complexity (wmc) = 0 show no concentrated behavioral complexity to decompose; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 indicate no coupling that suggests multiple responsibilities; only 3 fields (nof = 3) and LOC = 79 alone are not sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization. Overall the provided metrics offer no signs that the class should be further decomposed."
