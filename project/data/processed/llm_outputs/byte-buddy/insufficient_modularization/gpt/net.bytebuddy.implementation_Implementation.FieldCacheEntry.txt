    "justification": "In isolation the class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it has only 2 fields (nof=2), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low size/complexity (loc=64, wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). The cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not indicate fragmented responsibilities. Dependencies are limited to three types. These metrics collectively indicate a small, cohesive structure that does not require further decomposition."
