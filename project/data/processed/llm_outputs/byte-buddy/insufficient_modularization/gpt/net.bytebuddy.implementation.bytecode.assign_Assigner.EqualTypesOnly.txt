    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=26, WMC=0, NOM=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only two external type dependencies. Depth of inheritance is shallow (DIT=1) and cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) does not indicate poor cohesion. There is no evidence of high complexity, many responsibilities, or large size that would justify further decomposition."
