    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher.Disjunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=34, NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no complexity), NOF=1 (one field). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a shallow inheritance depth (DIT=1). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex and does not present evidence that it should be further decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
