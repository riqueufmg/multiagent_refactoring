    "justification": "Class shows low size and complexity (loc=28, wmc=0), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), a single field (nof=1), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is small and simple; there is no evidence it has grown large or complex enough to require further decomposition. Analysis performed in isolation: given the provided metrics and dependencies, insufficient modularization is not detected."
