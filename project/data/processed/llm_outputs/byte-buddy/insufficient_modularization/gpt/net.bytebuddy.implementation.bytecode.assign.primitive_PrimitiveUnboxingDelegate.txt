    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is large (LOC = 235) and contains substantial implementation complexity (WMC = 23) while having a moderate number of methods (NOM = 6) and many fields (NOF = 7), suggesting large, complex methods rather than smaller cohesive units. Cohesion is relatively low (LCOM = 0.666), indicating methods are not tightly related and multiple responsibilities likely co-exist. The presence of nested/related types (dependencies include UnboxingResponsible and ExplicitlyTypedUnboxingResponsible) implies the class bundles multiple roles that could be separated. Taken together (high LOC, high WMC, low cohesion, multiple fields and inner responsibilities) these metrics support detecting Insufficient Modularization."
