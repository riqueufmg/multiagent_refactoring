    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodNameTransformer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exposes only one method (nom = 1) while being relatively large (loc = 77) and holding multiple fields (nof = 4). This combination (few methods + high LOC) indicates that substantial behavior is concentrated in a single method rather than decomposed into smaller methods/classes. WMC = 1 with high LOC suggests complexity is implemented inside that lone method. Additionally, fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show no evident external modular interactions to distribute responsibilities. These elements together justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from further decomposition."
