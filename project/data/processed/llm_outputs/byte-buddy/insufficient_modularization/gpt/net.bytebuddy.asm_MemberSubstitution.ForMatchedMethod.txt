    "justification": "Class has small size and low complexity: loc=66, nof=3 fields, nom=0 methods, wmc=0. Fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate no coupling that suggests combined responsibilities. There is no evidence of high complexity or many responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
