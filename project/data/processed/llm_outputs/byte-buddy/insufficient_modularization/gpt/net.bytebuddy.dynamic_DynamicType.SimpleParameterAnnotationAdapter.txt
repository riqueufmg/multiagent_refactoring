    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.SimpleParameterAnnotationAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=25, NOM=0, WMC=0. It has no measured cohesion problems (LCOM not indicating unmet decomposition), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and minimal dependencies. Given the lack of methods, low size, and low complexity, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
