    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=17), no fields (nof=0) and no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two listed dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
