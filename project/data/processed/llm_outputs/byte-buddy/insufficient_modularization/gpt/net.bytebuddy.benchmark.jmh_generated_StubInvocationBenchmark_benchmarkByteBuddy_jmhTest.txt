    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddy_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Excessive number of fields (nof=263) and substantial size (LOC=276) combined with high implementation complexity (WMC=42). The class has only 9 methods (nom=9, nopm=8) so complexity and state are concentrated in a small set of routines, suggesting a monolithic, stateful design. It has no subclasses (nc=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0), indicating the class has not been decomposed into smaller cooperating types. These factors justify detection of Insufficient Modularization."
