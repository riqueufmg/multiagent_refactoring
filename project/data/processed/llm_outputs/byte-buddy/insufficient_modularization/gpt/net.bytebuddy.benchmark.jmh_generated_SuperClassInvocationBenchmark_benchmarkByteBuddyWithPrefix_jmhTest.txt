    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being a monolithic unit: very high number of fields (nof = 263) and substantial size (loc = 276) while having a relatively small set of methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8). Combined with a high complexity score (wmc = 42) this indicates many responsibilities and large internal state that could be decomposed. The lack of inheritance depth (dit = 0) implies decomposition has not been applied via subclasses. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
