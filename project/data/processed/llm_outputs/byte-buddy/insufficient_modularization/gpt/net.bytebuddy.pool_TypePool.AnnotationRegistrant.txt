    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.AnnotationRegistrant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc=274) while declaring a relatively high number of fields (nof=11) and no methods (nom=0). This size/field imbalance indicates multiple responsibilities or substantial implementation concentrated in a single class. Combined with an anomalous cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) and zero WMC reported, the evidence points to insufficient decomposition — the class should be considered for further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
