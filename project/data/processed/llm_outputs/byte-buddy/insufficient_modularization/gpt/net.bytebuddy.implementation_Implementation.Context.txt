    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Context",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it has very high size (loc = 1133) and a large number of fields (nof = 38), indicating high internal complexity and state. It depends on a wide range of unrelated concerns (19 distinct dependencies spanning bytecode generation, type/field/method descriptions, annotations, auxiliary types, type writer, class file version, visibility, etc.), which suggests multiple responsibilities are mixed into a single class. The shallow inheritance depth (dit = 1) and the class-level metrics imply the functionality is not decomposed via specialization. These elements (large LOC, many fields, and broad dependency set) justify that the class should be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
