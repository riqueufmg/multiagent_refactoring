    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_benchmarkJavassist_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very high number of fields (nof = 263) combined with relatively few methods (nom = 9) and moderate size/complexity (loc = 276, wmc = 42). The imbalance between a large field set and small method set suggests the class aggregates many responsibilities or data that could be decomposed into smaller classes or modules. These metrics (nof 263, nom 9, loc 276, wmc 42) justify recommending further decomposition."
