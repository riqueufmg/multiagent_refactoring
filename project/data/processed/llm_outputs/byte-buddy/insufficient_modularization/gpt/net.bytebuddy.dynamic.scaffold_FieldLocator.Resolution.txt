{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.Resolution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show symptoms of insufficient modularization: it has very low implementation complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), and only one field (nof=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no measured children or inheritance depth (nc=0, dit=0). Although loc=82 is moderate, the absence of methods and low complexity indicate the class is not a large undecomposed implementation; LCOM is not meaningful here (lcom=-1.0). Therefore, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
