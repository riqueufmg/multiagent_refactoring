    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=42, number of fields=noF=2, number of methods=nom=0 and WMC=0 indicate no internal complexity to decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). There are no signs of high cohesion/size or complex behavior that would benefit from further modularization, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
