    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is small (51), WMC is 0 (no measured complexity), NOM is 0 (no methods to decompose), NOF is 3 (few fields), FANIN and FANOUT are 0 (no coupling), and LCOM = -1.0 suggests high cohesion. Given the small size, low complexity, and low coupling, further decomposition is not warranted."
