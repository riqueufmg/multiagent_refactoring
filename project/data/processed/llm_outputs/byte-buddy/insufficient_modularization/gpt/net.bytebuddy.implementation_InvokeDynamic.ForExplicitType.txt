    "justification": "Class has very low size and complexity: loc=22, wmc=0, nom=0 (no methods), nof=1 (one field). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only two external dependencies. LCOM=-1 likely indicates cohesion metrics are not applicable due to absence of methods. There is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or mixed responsibilities that would justify further decomposition."
