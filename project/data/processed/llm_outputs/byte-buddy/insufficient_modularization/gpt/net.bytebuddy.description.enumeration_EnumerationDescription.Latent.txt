    "justification": "No: metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class is small (loc=43), has a minimal number of fields (nof=2), no methods (nom=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency). There is no evidence in the provided metrics that the class is large, complex, or should be further decomposed."
