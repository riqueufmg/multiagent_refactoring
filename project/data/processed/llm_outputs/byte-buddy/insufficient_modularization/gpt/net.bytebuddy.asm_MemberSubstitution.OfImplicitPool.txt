    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=13, nom=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies. No methods or complexity to decompose and LCOM is not indicative of poor cohesion. Given the minimal size and lack of implementation complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
