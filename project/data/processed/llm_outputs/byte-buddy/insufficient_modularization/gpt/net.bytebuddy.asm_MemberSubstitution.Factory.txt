    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows low size and complexity: LOC = 46, WMC = 0, NOM = 0, indicating no implementation logic to decompose. It has 5 fields (NOF = 5) but no methods or measurable complexity, and fanin/fanout = 0, so there is no evidence of high coupling or concentration of responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition. Given these metrics, there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
