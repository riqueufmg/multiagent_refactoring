    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Summary",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: it has only 3 fields (nof=3) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), low size (loc=65) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0). Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. Given its small size, lack of behavioral complexity, and no external coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
