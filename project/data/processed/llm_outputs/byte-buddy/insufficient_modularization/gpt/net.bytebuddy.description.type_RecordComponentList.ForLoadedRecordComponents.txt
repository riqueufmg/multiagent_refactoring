    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentList.ForLoadedRecordComponents",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC = 35, number of methods (nom) = 0, WMC = 0, only 1 field (nof = 1), fan-in = 0 and fan-out = 0, DIT = 0, and LCOM = -1.0. These metrics indicate low size, low complexity, and low coupling, so there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
