    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.TypeArgumentList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=74), low complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0), few fields (nof=3), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
