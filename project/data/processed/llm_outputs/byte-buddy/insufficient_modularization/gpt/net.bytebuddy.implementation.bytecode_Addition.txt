    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple (LOC=46, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOPM=2). Although LCOM=0.666 indicates moderate cohesion, the overall size and low complexity do not justify further decomposition. No incoming or outgoing coupling is reported (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1), so there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
