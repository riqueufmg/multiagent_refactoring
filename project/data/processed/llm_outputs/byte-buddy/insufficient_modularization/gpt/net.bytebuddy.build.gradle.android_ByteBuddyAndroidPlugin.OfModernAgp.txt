    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=34 (small size), WMC=0 and NOM=0 (no methods to split), NOF=1 (single field), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling), LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable due to lack of methods). Given the class in isolation, there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would require further decomposition."
