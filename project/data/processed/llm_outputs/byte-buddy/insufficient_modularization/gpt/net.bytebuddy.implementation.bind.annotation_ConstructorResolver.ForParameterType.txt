    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and lacks internal complexity: LOC=14, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion issues reported. Given the absence of methods, fields, and complexity, there is no evidence this class has not been decomposed further—insufficient modularization is not detected."
