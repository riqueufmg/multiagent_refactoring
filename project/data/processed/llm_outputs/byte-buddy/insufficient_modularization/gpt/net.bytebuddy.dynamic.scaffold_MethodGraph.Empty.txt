    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Empty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "In isolation the class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: loc=55 (moderate size), nom=0, nof=0, nopm=0 and wmc=0 indicate no methods or fields and no complexity to decompose; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling; dependencies are limited to MethodGraph and MethodDescription. Given the absence of internal complexity or a large method count, further decomposition is not warranted."
