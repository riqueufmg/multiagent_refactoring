    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC is 61 (small), NOM (number of methods) = 0 and WMC = 0 (no internal complexity), NOF = 3 (few fields), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no coupling to decompose), LCOM = -1.0 (no meaningful cohesion data). Given the small size, lack of methods/complexity and absence of dependencies, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
