    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=47, number of fields=2, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no measurable internal complexity (nom=0, lcom=-1.0 indicates no method-level cohesion data). Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has grown large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
