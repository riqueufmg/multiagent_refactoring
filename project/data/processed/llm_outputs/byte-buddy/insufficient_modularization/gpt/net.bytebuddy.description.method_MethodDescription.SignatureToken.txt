    "justification": "Evaluated in isolation, the class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: LOC is moderate (106) but behavioral complexity is absent (nom=0, wmc=0), it holds few fields (nof=3), has minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. The cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) is ambiguous here but provides no concrete evidence of multiple responsibilities. Overall the metrics do not justify further decomposition."
