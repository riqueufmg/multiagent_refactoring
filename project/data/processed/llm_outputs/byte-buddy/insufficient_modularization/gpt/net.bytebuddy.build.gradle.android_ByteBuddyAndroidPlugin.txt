    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size ([loc]=528) and a high number of features ([nof]=24) while containing many nested/inner helper types listed in its dependencies (GetOutputDirFunction, GetOutputFileFunction, GetLocalClassesDirsFunction, GetLocalClassesFunction, GetProjectJarsFunction, TransformationDispatcher, ForLegacyAndroid, RuntimeClassPathResolver). The file also references multiple task/service responsibilities (ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask, LegacyByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask, ByteBuddyAndroidService), indicating multiple responsibilities concentrated in one class. Although [wmc]=2 and [lcom]=0.0 do not indicate high per-method complexity or low cohesion, the large LOC combined with many embedded helper types and varied responsibilities suggest the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
