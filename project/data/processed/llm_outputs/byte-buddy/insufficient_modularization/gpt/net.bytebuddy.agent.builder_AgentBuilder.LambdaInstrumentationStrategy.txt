    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaInstrumentationStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 1105) and a high number of fields (nof = 31) indicate it contains a lot of state and/or responsibilities that could be split. It also depends on a wide variety of distinct concerns (approximately 20 dependencies listed, including MethodDescription, FieldDescription, TypeDescription, Implementation, ByteCodeAppender, ByteBuddy, various modifier and manifestation types, and bytecode-level classes), which suggests multiple responsibilities are mixed into this single class. Given the large LOC, many fields, and diverse dependencies, the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
