    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=44, no methods (nom=0), one field (nof=1), weighted method count=0 (wmc=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and depth of inheritance=0 (dit=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not exhibit signs of being insufficiently modularized."
