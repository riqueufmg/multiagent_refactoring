    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=35, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. No methods and a single field indicate the class is small and low in complexity/coupling. There is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would justify further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
