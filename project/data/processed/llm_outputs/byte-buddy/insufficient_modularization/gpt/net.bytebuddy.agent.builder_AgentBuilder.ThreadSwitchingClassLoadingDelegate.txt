    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc: 106) while containing multiple fields (nof: 6), indicating potential multiple responsibilities bundled together. Although method and complexity metrics are zero (nom: 0, wmc: 0), the substantial LOC combined with multiple fields and minimal external coupling (fanin: 0, fanout: 0) suggests internal content that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules to reduce size and improve modularity."
