    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer.WithDelegation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: a large size (loc = 358) combined with a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 7) while reporting no methods (nom = 0), which suggests a single large implementation body rather than a decomposed design. Additionally the class depends on many external types (9 listed dependencies: AgentBuilder, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeValidation, Assigner, ClassLoadingStrategy, ConstructorStrategy, AccessControllerPlugin, ResettableClassFileTransformer, JavaType), implying it coordinates multiple concerns. These metrics together (high LOC, multiple fields, many dependencies, and no reported methods) justify flagging insufficient modularization."
