    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Disabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has small size and complexity: loc=18, wmc=0, nom=0, nof=0. Cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 (no indication of internal fragmentation). Low coupling: fanin=0, fanout=0 and only two listed dependencies. Given the lack of methods/fields and low complexity, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
