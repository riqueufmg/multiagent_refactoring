    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, monolithic class: LOC is modest (77), WMC is 0 and NOM is 0 (no many/complex methods to split), LCOM = -1.0 suggests good cohesion, fanin and fanout are 0 (low coupling), DIT = 2 is shallow, and there are only 4 fields. Dependencies are limited. These elements together do not justify marking this class as suffering from Insufficient Modularization."
