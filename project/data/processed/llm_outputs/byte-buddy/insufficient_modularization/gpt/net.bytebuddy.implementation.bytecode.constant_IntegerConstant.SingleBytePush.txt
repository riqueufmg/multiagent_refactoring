    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=23, WMC=0, no methods (nom=0), one field (nof=1). Low coupling and usage: fanin=0, fanout=0. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition; no signs of large size or high complexity that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
