    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=46, NOM=3, WMC=3. Low coupling: fanin=0, fanout=0, only two declared dependencies. No nested types (nc=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.666) but not indicative of a large, undecomposed class. These metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization."
