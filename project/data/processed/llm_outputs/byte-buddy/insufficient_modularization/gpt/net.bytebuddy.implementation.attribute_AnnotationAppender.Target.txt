    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed, high-complexity class. Although LOC is 167, the class shows 0 methods (nom=0) and WMC=0, a modest number of fields (nof=6), no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no explicit cohesion problem (lcom reported as -1.0/unavailable). The lack of methods and absence of coupling or high complexity metrics provide no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
