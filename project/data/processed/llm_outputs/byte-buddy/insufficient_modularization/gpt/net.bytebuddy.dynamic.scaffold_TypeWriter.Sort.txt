    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Sort",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=44), very low complexity (WMC=0), no methods (NOM=0) and only 2 fields (NOF=2). It has no inbound or outbound coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no reported dependencies. LCOM is not indicative here (LCOM=-1.0). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and not a candidate for further decomposition."
