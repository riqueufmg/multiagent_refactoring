    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (loc = 22), no fields (nof = 0) and no methods (nom = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), no external coupling (fanout = 0) and no dependencies. These elements show no evidence that the class is large or complex and therefore no justification for further decomposition."
