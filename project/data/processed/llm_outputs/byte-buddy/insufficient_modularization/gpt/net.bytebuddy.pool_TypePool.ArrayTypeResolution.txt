    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=43), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0) indicating limited implementation to decompose, only two fields (nof=2), very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and minimal external dependencies. These metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition."
