    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddySimpleTaskConfiguration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=49, WMC=3, NOM=2, NOF=2 and only 1 public method (NOPM=1). Cohesion is high (LCOM=1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no evidence that it has insufficient modularization or requires further decomposition."
