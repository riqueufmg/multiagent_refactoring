    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Insufficient modularization not detected: although the class has 110 LOC, other metrics show no signs of an undecomposed, complex class. nom=0 and wmc=0 indicate no defined methods/complexity; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling, and lcom=-1.0 (no applicable cohesion data) provides no evidence of multiple responsibilities. Given the lack of methods, complexity, or coupling in the provided metrics, there is insufficient evidence to claim this class suffers from insufficient modularization."
