    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: an extremely large number of fields (nof = 263) combined with substantial implementation size (loc = 276) and non-trivial complexity (wmc = 42) while having a relatively small number of methods (nom = 9). The high field count indicates excessive internal state that could be decomposed into separate classes/components to reduce size and complexity. Although cohesion metric (lcom = 0.0) is low, the disproportion between fields and methods and the overall size and complexity justify refactoring into smaller modules."
