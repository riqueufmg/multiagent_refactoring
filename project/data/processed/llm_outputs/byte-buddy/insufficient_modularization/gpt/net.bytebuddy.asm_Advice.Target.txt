    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Target",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it has a large implementation size (loc = 566) and a high number of fields (nof = 17), and it depends on many external components (11 dependencies listed). These characteristics (large LOC + many fields + many dependencies) indicate multiple responsibilities and implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposing the class into smaller, more focused units. Note: other metrics (nom = 0, wmc = 0) appear unset and do not negate the evidence from LOC, nof, and dependency count."
