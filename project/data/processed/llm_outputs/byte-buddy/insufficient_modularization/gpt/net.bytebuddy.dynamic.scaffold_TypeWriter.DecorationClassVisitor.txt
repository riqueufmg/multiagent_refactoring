    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC is only 59, NOM (number of methods) = 0 and WMC = 0 (no measured method complexity), there are only 4 fields, fanin/fanout = 0 (low coupling) and no evidence of high cohesion problems. Given the small size, lack of methods and low complexity/coupling, there is no basis to flag insufficient modularization in isolation."
