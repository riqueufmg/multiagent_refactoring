    "justification": "Class is not insufficiently modularized: small size (LOC=65), no methods (NOM=0) and zero complexity (WMC=0) indicate little implementation to decompose. LCOM=-1.0 suggests no cohesion issues, and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=2 is expected for a simple subclass and does not imply missed decomposition."
