    "justification": "Class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=63), no methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/weight complexity (wmc=0), limited fields (nof=4), and no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and not a large, undecomposed unit."
