    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 486), many fields (nof = 11) and methods (nom = 12) with a large public surface (nopm = 10); elevated implementation complexity (WMC = 14); multiple role-specific nested/related types in its dependencies (FixedValue.ForValue, FixedValue.ForNullValue, FixedValue.AssignerConfigurable) suggesting several responsibilities bundled into one class; presence of subclasses/variants (nc = 5); and only moderate cohesion (LCOM = 0.5). Together these metrics indicate the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
