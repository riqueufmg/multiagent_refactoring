    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large or complex class. The class has 186 LOC and 9 methods (5 public) with a moderate WMC of 10, which is not excessively high. LCOM is 0.333, indicating reasonable cohesion. It has a single field and DIT 0, and fanin/fanout are 0, suggesting low coupling. Given moderate size, acceptable complexity and good cohesion in isolation, there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
