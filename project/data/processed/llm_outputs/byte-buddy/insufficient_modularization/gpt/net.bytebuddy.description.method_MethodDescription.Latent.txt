    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 208) while declaring many fields (nof = 11) but no methods (nom = 0). This combination indicates a sizable aggregation of state without localized behavior, and its dependency set (AnnotationValue, ParameterDescription, AnnotationList, ParameterList, TypeList, MethodDescription, TypeDescription) spans multiple concerns. These facts suggest the class has not been adequately decomposed and could be split into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and complexity."
