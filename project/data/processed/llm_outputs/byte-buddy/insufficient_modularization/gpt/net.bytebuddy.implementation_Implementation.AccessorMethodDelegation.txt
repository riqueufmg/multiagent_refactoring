    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.AccessorMethodDelegation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class shows no signs of under-modularization — small size (loc=39), no methods (nom=0) and correspondingly zero complexity (wmc=0), a single field (nof=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and LCOM=-1.0 (no method-based cohesion data). These metrics indicate the class is small and simple in isolation, so insufficient modularization is not indicated."
