    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Indicators of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 126) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and only a few fields (nof = 4) suggests substantial implementation that is not decomposed into smaller methods or helper classes; the class depends on many distinct concepts (AnnotationValue, ParameterDescription, AnnotationList, ParameterList, TypeList, MethodDescription, MethodNameTransformer, TypeDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), implying multiple responsibilities that could be separated; low/ambiguous cohesion and complexity metrics (wmc = 0, lcom = -1.0) combined with the size further point to an undecomposed class and a likely opportunity to split functionality into smaller, more focused units."
