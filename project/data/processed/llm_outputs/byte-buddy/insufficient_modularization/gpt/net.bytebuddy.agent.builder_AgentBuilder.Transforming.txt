    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=55, NOF=3, NOM=0, WMC=0, DIT=0. Cohesion flag (LCOM=-1.0) and zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) show no evident responsibility bloat or high complexity. Only one external dependency is listed. Given the low size, zero methods, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that this class requires further decomposition (no Insufficient Modularization)."
