    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.RecordComponentAttributeAppender.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No: metrics indicate the class is small and low in complexity and coupling. LOC=39, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1, LCOM=-1.0, DIT=1, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. These values show few/no methods, minimal size, low complexity and low coupling, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
