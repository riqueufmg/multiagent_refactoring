    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and simple (loc=40, nof=3), has no methods (nom=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0), with no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem. These metrics show low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
