    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC is only 87 and the class has 4 fields, but zero methods (nom=0, wmc=0) which suggests a simple data holder rather than a large, complex class needing decomposition. Low inheritance depth (dit=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and a strongly cohesive LCOM value (-1.0) further argue against insufficient modularization. Given these elements in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be decomposed further."
