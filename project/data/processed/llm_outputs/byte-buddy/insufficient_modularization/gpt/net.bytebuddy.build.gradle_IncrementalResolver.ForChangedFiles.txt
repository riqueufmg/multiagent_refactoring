    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has small size and trivial structure: loc=25, nom=0, nof=0, nopm=0, wmc=0. Low coupling and dependencies: fanin=0, fanout=0, single external type referenced (org.gradle.work.ChangeType). Depth is shallow (dit=1) and cohesion metric is not indicative (lcom=-1.0). Given the lack of methods, fields, complexity, or coupling, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized."
