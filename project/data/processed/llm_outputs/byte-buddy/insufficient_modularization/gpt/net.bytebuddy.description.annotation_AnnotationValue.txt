    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it has an extremely large size (loc = 2457) and a very high number of fields (nof = 42), while exposing relatively few methods (nom = 7). The dependency list shows many nested/auxiliary types (ForIncompatibleType, ForMissingType, ForArrayType, ForNonArrayType, PropertyDelegate, State, Sort, RenderingDispatcher, AbstractBase, Loaded) indicating multiple distinct responsibilities implemented inside the same class file. The combination of very large LOC, many fields and multiple embedded role-specific types suggests the class was not fully decomposed and could be refactored into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
