    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentList.ForTokens",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "In isolation the class is small and low-complexity: LOC=36, number of fields=2, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it only references two types (TypeDescription, RecordComponentDescription). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
