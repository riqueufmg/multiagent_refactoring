    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.UnresolvedTypeVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of excessive size or complexity: LOC=58 (small), WMC=0 and NOM=0 (no methods / no cyclomatic complexity), NOF=4 (small number of fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem. In isolation there is insufficient evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
