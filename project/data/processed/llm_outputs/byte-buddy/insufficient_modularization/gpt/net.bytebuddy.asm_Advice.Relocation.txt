    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Relocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=32, 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0) and WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no non-private members (nopf=0, nopm=0). These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
