    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, highly complex class. Although LOC = 96 and NOF = 6 show some size and state, NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 indicate no behavioral complexity or many responsibilities to split out. FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 and no dependencies show low coupling. Given the absence of methods/complexity (NOM=0, WMC=0) there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
