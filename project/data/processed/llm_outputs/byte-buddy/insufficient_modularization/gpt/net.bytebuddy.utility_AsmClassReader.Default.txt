    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: although LOC = 88, the class has no methods (nom = 0) and no measured complexity (wmc = 0), only one field (nof = 1), and no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). LCOM = -1.0 suggests no relevant cohesion data to signal multiple responsibilities. The dependency list is small and does not imply high responsibility. Taken in isolation, there is insufficient evidence that this class should be further decomposed."
