    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=29, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, DIT=1, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. It defines no methods and only a single field, indicating minimal implementation complexity and responsibility. There is no evidence from the provided metrics or dependencies that further decomposition is warranted, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
