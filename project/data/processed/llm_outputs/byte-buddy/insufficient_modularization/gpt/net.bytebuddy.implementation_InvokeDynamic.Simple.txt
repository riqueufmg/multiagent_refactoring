    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: loc=42, wmc=0, nom=0 (no methods to further decompose), nof=2 (only two fields), fanin=0, fanout=0. LCOM=-1.0 suggests good cohesion. Given the lack of internal methods/complexity and minimal coupling (few dependencies), there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
