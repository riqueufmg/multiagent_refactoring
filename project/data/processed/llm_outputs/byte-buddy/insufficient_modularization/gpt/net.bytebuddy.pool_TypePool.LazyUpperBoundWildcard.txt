    "justification": "Metrics show the class is small and low-complexity: LOC=58, NOM=0, WMC=0, DIT=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has a small, limited set of dependencies (3). There is no evidence of many methods, high complexity, or high cohesion/large responsibility (only 5 fields, no methods). Given these values, there is no indication that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
