    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is minimal and does not exhibit size or complexity that would require further decomposition: LOC=16, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=0, WMC=0, coupling measures fanin=0 and fanout=0, and no listed dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 appears not to indicate cohesion problems given the absence of members. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
