    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected: the class has an extremely high number of fields (nof = 256) while containing no methods (nom = 0) and zero method complexity (wmc = 0). This indicates a large concentration of data likely representing multiple responsibilities that have not been decomposed. Additional metrics support this conclusion: loc = 18 (many fields declared in few lines) and fanin = 0 / fanout = 0 (the class is self-contained, so splitting into smaller modules is feasible). These elements together justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
