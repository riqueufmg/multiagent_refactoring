    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=37, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=1. Low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few external dependencies. These metrics show no evidence of a large, complex class that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
