    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=28, single field (nof=1), zero methods (nom=0), and zero complexity (wmc=0). It has no inheritance depth (dit=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and an LCOM value indicating cohesion. Given its minimal size, lack of internal complexity, and low coupling to other types, there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
