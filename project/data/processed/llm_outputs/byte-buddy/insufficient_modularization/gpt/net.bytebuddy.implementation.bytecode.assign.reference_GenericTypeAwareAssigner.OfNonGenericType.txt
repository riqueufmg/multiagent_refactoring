    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner.OfNonGenericType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=19, no methods (nom=0), weighted method count WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). These metrics indicate low size and low internal complexity, so there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
