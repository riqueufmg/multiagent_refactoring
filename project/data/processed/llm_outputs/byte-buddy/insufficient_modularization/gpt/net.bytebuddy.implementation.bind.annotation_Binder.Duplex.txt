    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC = 39, WMC = 0, NOM = 0, NOF = 3. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only three external type dependencies are listed. There are no methods to decompose (NOM = 0) and overall size/complexity metrics do not indicate an excessively large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition."
