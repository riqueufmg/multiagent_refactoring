    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.AttributeObtainingFieldVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=28), no methods reported (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single external dependency. These metrics indicate the class is already small and simple, so there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
