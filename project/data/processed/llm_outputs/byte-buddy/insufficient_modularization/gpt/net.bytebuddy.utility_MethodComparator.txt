    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has a single method (nom=1, nopm=1) but non-trivial size and complexity (loc=37, wmc=7). A one-method class with 37 lines and complexity 7 indicates the method likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed. LCOM=-1.0 shows cohesion is not the issue; the class's lack of multiple smaller methods (nom=1) combined with a relatively large, complex implementation justifies detecting Insufficient Modularization."
