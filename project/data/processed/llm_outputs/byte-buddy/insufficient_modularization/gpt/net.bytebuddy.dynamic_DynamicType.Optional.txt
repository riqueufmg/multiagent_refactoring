    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Optional",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 30, number of methods (nom) = 0, weighted methods per class (wmc) = 0, dispatch/complexity indicators (nc, dit) = 0, and low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). There is no internal complexity or high cohesion metric suggesting an incompletely decomposed class; the provided dependencies are few. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
