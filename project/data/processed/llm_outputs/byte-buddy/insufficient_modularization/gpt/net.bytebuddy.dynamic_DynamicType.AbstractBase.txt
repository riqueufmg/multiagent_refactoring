    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.AbstractBase",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively large size (loc = 225) while depending on a very large number of external types (43 distinct dependencies listed), indicating multiple responsibilities or concerns are being handled within the same class. The low cohesion indicator (lcom = -1.0) suggests internal elements are not strongly related, and the inheritance depth (dit = 2) combined with extensive coupling increases complexity. Together these elements (LOC = 225, 43 dependencies, lcom = -1.0, dit = 2) justify flagging this class for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
