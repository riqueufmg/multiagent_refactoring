    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.PoolStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 287) which suggests substantial implementation that could be split; it holds multiple fields (nof = 8) indicating multiple state concerns; it depends on several external components (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool), implying mixed responsibilities; cohesion metric is unavailable/indeterminate (lcom = -1.0) which, combined with high LOC and multiple fields/dependencies, supports the possibility that the class has not been fully decomposed and could benefit from modularization."
