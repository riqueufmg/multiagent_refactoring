    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undivided, overly large or complex class: LOC = 54 (moderate size), NOM = 0 and NOF = 0 (no methods/fields to suggest many responsibilities), WMC = 0 (no cyclomatic complexity), LCOM = -1.0 (no cohesion problem signaled), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (low coupling). DIT = 2 is small. Given these values, there is no evidence in the provided data that the class requires further decomposition."
