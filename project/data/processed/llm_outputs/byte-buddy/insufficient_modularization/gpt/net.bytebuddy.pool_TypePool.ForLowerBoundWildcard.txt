    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForLowerBoundWildcard",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has substantial size (loc = 92) while containing a relatively large number of fields (nof = 6) but no declared methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0). This combination (many fields + no methods) suggests bundled state and/or multiple responsibilities that are not decomposed into separate behavior units. The cohesion metric is not informative (lcom = -1.0) and coupling metrics show isolation (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), which indicates the class could be split without heavy external impact. It also depends on multiple types (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool), suggesting it may mix concerns. Taken in isolation, these elements indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
