    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=44, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPF=0, NC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no fields, no methods, and no dependencies. Given the low size (44 LOC) and zero complexity/behavioral elements, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that it would benefit from additional modularization."
