    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large number of fields (nof = 263) combined with a moderate physical size (loc = 275) and relatively few methods (nom = 9) — a fields-to-methods ratio of ~29:1 — which indicates many responsibilities/data held in a single class rather than decomposed. Implementation complexity is high (wmc = 42), suggesting complex method logic that could be split across smaller classes. Although it has low external coupling metrics (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), the internal size and complexity metrics (nof, loc, wmc, nom) justify decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
