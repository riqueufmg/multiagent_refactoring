    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: modest size (LOC=60), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (WMC=0) so there is no large method to split, only two fields (nof=2) which is not excessive, and no coupling evidence (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependency list is minimal. These elements show no sign that the class has not been decomposed and therefore do not justify marking it as insufficiently modularized."
