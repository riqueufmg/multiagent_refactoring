    "justification": "Class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc = 12), no fields (nof = 0) and no methods (nom = 0), minimal complexity (wmc = 0), and low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). LCOM = -1.0 (not indicating cohesion problems). Although one dependency is listed (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher), the metric profile indicates the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition."
