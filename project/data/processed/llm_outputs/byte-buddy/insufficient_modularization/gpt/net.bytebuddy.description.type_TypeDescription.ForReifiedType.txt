    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: number of methods (nom) = 0, weighted method count (wmc) = 0, number of fields (nof) = 1, fanin = 0, fanout = 0. Although lines of code (loc) = 66, there is no internal complexity or many responsibilities shown (no methods, low coupling). LCOM is non‑positive. Based on these elements in isolation, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
