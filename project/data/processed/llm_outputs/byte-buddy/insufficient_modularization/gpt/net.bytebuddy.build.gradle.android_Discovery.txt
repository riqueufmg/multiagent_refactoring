    "justification": "The class shows no signs of excessive size or complexity: LOC=16, nof=0, nom=0, nopm=0, WMC=0, NC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. LCOM=-1.0 indicates no meaningful cohesion data (likely no methods/fields). Given the minimal size, zero complexity, and lack of dependencies, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
