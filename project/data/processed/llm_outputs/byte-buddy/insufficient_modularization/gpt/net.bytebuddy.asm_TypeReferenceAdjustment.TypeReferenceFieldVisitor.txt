    "justification": "Class has no fields (nof=0) and no methods (nom=0), very small size (loc=22) and zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only one listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader). Given the absence of substantial implementation to decompose and the low complexity and coupling metrics, there is no evidence that further modularization is needed."
