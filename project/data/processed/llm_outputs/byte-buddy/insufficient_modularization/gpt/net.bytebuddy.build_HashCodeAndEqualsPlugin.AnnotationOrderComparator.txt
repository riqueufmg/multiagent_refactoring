    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin.AnnotationOrderComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=25, WMC=0, NOM=0. It has no measured coupling or interactions (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two listed dependencies, indicating limited responsibilities. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem in the provided data. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is large or multifaceted enough to require further decomposition."
