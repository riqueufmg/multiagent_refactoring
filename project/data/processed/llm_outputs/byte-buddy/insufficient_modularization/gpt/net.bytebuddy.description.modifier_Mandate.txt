    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=46, WMC=5, NOM=5. It has minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no deep inheritance (DIT=0). Although LCOM=0.8 indicates moderate cohesion concerns, the overall size and low complexity do not justify further decomposition; there is insufficient evidence that breaking the class into smaller modules would reduce size or complexity."
