    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being an under-decomposed large/complex unit: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted method count (wmc) = 0 indicate no internal behavioral complexity to split; number of fields (nof) = 1 and fanin/fanout = 0/0 indicate very low coupling; dependencies are minimal (2). Although lines of code (loc) = 77, the absence of methods and zero complexity metrics imply it is not a large/cohesive implementation that would benefit from further decomposition, so the Insufficient Modularization smell is not detected."
