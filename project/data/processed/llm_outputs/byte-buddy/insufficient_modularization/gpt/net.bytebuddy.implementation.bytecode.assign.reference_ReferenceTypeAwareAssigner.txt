    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.ReferenceTypeAwareAssigner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only 1 method (nom=1) and small size (loc=24), with modest cyclomatic complexity (wmc=4). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0). Depth of inheritance is shallow (dit=1). These metrics indicate the class is small, cohesive, and lowly coupled, so further decomposition is not warranted."
