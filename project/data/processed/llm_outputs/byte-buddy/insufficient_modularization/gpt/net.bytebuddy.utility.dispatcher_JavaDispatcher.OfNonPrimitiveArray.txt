    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.OfNonPrimitiveArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: loc=45, nof=2 (only two fields), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods/low complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), single external dependency. LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issues reported). Given the low size, lack of methods, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
