    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ParameterAnnotationAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: loc=25, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has no measured methods to indicate a large, undecomposed implementation. Given these metrics and only a few dependencies, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
