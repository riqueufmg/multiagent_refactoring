    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.DiscoveryStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 242) and a moderate number of fields (nof = 9) while reporting zero methods (nom = 0) and zero complexity metrics (wmc = 0). The high LOC combined with multiple fields indicates the class likely contains multiple responsibilities or large internal implementations that could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity. Other metrics (lcom = -1.0, dit = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0) do not contradict the indication that the class is insufficiently modularized."
