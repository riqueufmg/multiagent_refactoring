    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: loc is modest (80) but the class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0 / nopf=0), and 0 cyclomatic/weighted method complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), and there is no evidence of high implementation complexity or many responsibilities to justify further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
