    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: extremely large size (loc = 3402) and a very high number of fields (nof = 113) concentrated in a single class. It also depends on a large set of external types (34 listed dependencies), indicating multiple responsibilities and entangled behavior. The inheritance depth is minimal (dit = 1), so the class's complexity is not distributed through subclassing. These factors (very high LOC, many fields, many dependencies, low DIT) indicate the class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
