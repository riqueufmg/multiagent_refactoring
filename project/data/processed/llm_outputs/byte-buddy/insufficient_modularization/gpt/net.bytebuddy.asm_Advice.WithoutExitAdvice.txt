    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithoutExitAdvice",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of Insufficient Modularization: it has a small size (loc = 54), no measured methods or fields (nom = 0, nof = 0), zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 0), and no coupling activity (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given the absence of internal complexity or many responsibilities, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
