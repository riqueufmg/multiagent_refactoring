    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: loc=9, nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0, lcom=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0. Low size (9 LOC), zero methods/fields and zero complexity indicate no internal decomposition is needed. Dependency list is minimal (MethodDescription) and there is no evidence of high coupling or large implementation that would benefit from further modularization."
