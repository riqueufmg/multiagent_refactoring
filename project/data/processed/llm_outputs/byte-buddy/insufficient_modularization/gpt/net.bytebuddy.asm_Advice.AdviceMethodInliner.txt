    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modularized: it has a large size (loc = 235) and a high number of fields (nof = 16) while reporting no methods (nom = 0 / nopm = 0), suggesting a monolithic implementation or concentrated state/behavior that was not decomposed. It also depends on multiple external types (7 listed dependencies), indicating multiple responsibilities or interactions that could be separated. These elements (high LOC, many fields, multiple dependencies, and lack of smaller methods/components) justify detection of Insufficient Modularization."
