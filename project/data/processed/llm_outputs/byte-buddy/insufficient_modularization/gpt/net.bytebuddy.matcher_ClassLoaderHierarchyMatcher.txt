    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, cohesive class: LOC=33, NOM=3, WMC=5 and LCOM=0.0. Low method count and moderate cyclomatic complexity, together with no reported coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=0), provide no evidence that the class is overly large or handling multiple responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition."
