    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, large, or complex class: LOC = 51 (small), NOF = 3 (only three fields), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods/low complexity), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (low coupling). Given these values and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
