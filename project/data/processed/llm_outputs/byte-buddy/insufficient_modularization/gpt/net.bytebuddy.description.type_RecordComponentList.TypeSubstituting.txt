    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: loc=40, nom=0, wmc=0. It has minimal coupling/dependencies (fan-in=0, fan-out=0, dependencies count=2) and only 3 fields (nof=3). There are no methods to decompose and cohesion metric does not indicate internal structural problems (lcom=-1.0). Given the low size, complexity, and coupling, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
