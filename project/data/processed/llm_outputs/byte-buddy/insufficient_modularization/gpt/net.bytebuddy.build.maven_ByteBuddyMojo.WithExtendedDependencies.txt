    "justification": "The class is small and contains no decomposable implementation: LOC=21, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=0/NOPF=0 (no fields/packaged fields), WMC=0 (no complexity), DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and no dependencies. Given the absence of methods, fields, complexity or coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
