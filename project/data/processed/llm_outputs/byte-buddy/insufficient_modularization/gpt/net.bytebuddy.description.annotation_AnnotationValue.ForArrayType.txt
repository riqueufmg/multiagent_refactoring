    "justification": "LOC = 240 (large class size) while NOM = 0, NOF = 0, WMC = 0 and FANIN/FANOUT = 0; the large line count with no reported decomposition into methods/fields suggests the class is monolithic and not sufficiently decomposed. LCOM = -1.0 (anomalous) and absence of dependencies further indicate the implementation is self-contained and likely carrying multiple responsibilities that could be separated to reduce size/complexity."
