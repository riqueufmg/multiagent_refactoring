    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LOC is high (111) while the class exposes few methods (nom = 3), implying large/long methods (≈37 LOC/method) that likely combine multiple responsibilities; there is only one field (nof = 1) so behavior is concentrated in methods rather than separated into smaller stateful components; WMC is low (3) which indicates low branching complexity but not small size, suggesting procedural complexity inside long methods rather than well-factored classes; fanin/fanout = 0 shows the class is isolated, so decomposition would not increase coupling; dependency on ElementMatcher indicates it coordinates matching/filtering logic that could be split into smaller helper classes. These factors together indicate Insufficient Modularization and that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
