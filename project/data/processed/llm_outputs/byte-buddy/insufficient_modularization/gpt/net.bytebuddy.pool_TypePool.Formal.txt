    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modularized: it has large size (loc = 145) and many fields (nof = 12) while exposing no methods (nom = 0), indicating a large data/structure that has not been decomposed into smaller responsibilities. The presence of multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) increases conceptual complexity, and the reported cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) does not indicate high cohesion — together these factors justify refactoring into smaller, more focused units."
