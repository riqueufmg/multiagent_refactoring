    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForExplicitField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no sign of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=22), only 1 field (nof=1) and 0 methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only two referenced types. Given the minimal LOC, lack of behavioral complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
