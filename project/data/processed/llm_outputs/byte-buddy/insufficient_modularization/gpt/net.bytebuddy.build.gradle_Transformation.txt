    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Transformation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has moderate size and complexity (loc=221, wmc=22) and a non-trivial API (nom=12, nopm=9), its cohesion is high (lcom=0.1667) and it has modest internal state (nof=6). Coupling indicators show no incoming/outgoing coupling in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has no inheritance depth (dit=0). Considering the class in isolation, the metrics indicate a single cohesive responsibility rather than a class that should be further decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
