    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.WithLazyNavigation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class is relatively large (loc = 163) while containing multiple fields (nof = 6). The metrics show no declared methods (nom = 0) combined with substantial LOC, which suggests the class may embed substantial logic (initializers or mixed responsibilities) instead of being decomposed into smaller units. The class depends on several collaborators (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, TypeList, TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin), indicating multiple responsibilities that could be separated. The cohesion metric is not informative (lcom = -1.0) but does not contradict the size/field/dependency signals; overall these elements justify that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
