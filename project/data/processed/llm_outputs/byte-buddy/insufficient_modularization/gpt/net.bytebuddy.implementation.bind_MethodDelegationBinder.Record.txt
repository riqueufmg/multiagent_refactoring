    "justification": "Class is small and lacks internal complexity: LOC = 28, WMC = 0, number of methods/fields metrics (nof, nopf, nom, nopm) = 0. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only a single external dependency is listed. LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate low cohesion requiring decomposition. Given these metrics and treating the class in isolation, there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
