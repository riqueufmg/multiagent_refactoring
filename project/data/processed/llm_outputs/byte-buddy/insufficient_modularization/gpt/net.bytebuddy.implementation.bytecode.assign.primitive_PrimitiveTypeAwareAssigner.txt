    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveTypeAwareAssigner",

    "justification": "Small size and low complexity (LOC=33, WMC=5, NOM=2), very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), single field (NOF=1) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.0) indicate the class is already sufficiently modular; no evidence of a large, complex class that would benefit from further decomposition."
