    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an excessively large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition: loc=69 (small size), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no measured methods/complexity), nof=5 (only five fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling via calls), and only four external dependencies. There is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or high implementation complexity in the provided data, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
