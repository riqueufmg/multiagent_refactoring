    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows a large size (loc = 161) combined with multiple fields (nof = 6), indicating concentrated implementation that could be split. Although method and complexity counts are reported as zero (nom = 0, wmc = 0), the high LOC with non‑zero fields suggests substantial internal logic (e.g., long initializers or embedded responsibilities) that is a sign of insufficient modularization. Other metrics (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dit = 0, lcom = -1.0) do not contradict the size signal, and the single dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) does not mitigate the class's large size. Therefore the class should be considered a candidate for decomposition."
