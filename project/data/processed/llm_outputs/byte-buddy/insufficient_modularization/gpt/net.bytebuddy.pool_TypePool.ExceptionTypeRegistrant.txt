    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and simple: LOC=11, number of fields (nof)=0, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, NC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only a single lightweight dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). There is no evidence of high size or complexity that would require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
