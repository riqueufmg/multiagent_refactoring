    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=27), only 1 field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0) and no public methods (nopm=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), no dependencies, and LCOM is not indicating low cohesion (-1.0). In isolation these values show the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
