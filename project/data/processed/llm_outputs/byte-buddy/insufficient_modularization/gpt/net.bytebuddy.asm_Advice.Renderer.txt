    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed, complex class: LOC=160 is moderate; NOM=0 and WMC=0 show no implementation complexity or many responsibilities implemented as methods; NOF=7 (NOPF=6) suggests mainly data fields rather than a large combined implementation; FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 indicate low coupling; DIT=0 shows no deep hierarchy; LCOM=-1.0 does not signal poor cohesion. Given the lack of methods and low coupling/complexity, there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization."
