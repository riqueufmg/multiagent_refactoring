    "justification": "False — the class shows no signs of Insufficient Modularization: LOC=3, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, NOPF=0, NOPM=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, LCOM=-1.0. It is very small, has a single method, no fields and minimal complexity/cohesion metrics, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
