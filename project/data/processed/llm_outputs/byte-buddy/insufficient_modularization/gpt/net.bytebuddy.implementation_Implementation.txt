    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class appears insufficiently modular: the source file is very large (loc=1761) and contains many fields (nof=53) and many nested/related types (nc=50). The dependency list shows numerous inner/auxiliary types declared with the Implementation type (Implementation.Dispatcher, Implementation.DefaultMethodInvocation, Implementation.FrameGeneration, Implementation.SpecialMethodInvocation, Implementation.ExtractableView, Implementation.Compound, Implementation.Illegal, Implementation.Composable, etc.), indicating multiple distinct responsibilities packed into the same class file. These signs (very high LOC, large field count, many nested/auxiliary types declared under the same class) justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
