    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.NoOp",

    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=37), no methods or fields (nom=0, nopf=0, nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no coupling in or out (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition."
