    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=108 and NOM=9 show a modest size; WMC=12 is moderate (not high complexity); LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion (no evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities); fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate low coupling to other classes; NOF=6 and NOPM=6/NOPF=1 show a small, manageable public surface. Together these elements suggest the class is sufficiently modular and does not require further decomposition."
