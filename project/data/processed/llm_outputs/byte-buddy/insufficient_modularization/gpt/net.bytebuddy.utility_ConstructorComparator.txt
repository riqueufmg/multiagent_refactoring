    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=37, single method (nom=1, nopm=1), no fields (nof=0), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although WMC=7 indicates some method complexity, that complexity is confined to one method and does not indicate multiple responsibilities or undue size that would benefit from further decomposition. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
