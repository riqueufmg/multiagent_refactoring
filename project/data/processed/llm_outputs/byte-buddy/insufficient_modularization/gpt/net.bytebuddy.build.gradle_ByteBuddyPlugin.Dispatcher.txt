    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyPlugin.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: it has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 weighted method complexity (wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a negative LCOM (-1.0) indicating high cohesion. Although LOC is 90, the absence of methods/complexity and lack of dependencies provide no evidence that the class contains multiple responsibilities or would benefit from further decomposition."
