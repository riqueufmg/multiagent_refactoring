    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and contains no decomposable elements: loc=19, nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no measured complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. Given these metrics and analyzing the class in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
