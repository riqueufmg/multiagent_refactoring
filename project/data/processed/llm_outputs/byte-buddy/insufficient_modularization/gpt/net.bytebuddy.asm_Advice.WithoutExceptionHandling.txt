    "justification": "Class has small size and no internal complexity: LOC=49, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency). With no methods/fields or measurable complexity, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
