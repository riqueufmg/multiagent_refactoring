    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=41, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1. It has no methods to decompose (NOM=0) and shows no coupling pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate poor cohesion. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or needs further decomposition."
