    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Expanding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and has no internal complexity to decompose: loc=19, nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), fanout=0 and fanin=0 (no coupling), and no dependencies. Given these values and the requirement to analyze the class in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
