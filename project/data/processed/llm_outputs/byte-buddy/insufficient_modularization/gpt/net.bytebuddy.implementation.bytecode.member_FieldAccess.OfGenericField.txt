    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.FieldAccess.OfGenericField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=43, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=2. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has no public/instance methods to decompose (nopm=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion concerns in the provided data. Dependencies are limited (StackManipulation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDefinition). Given the low size, zero measured complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
