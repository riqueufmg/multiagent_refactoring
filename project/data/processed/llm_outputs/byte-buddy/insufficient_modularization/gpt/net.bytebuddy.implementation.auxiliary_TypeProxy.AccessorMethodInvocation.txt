    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=35, NOF=2 (only two fields), NOM=0, WMC=0, DIT=1, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods to decompose (NOM=0) and low coupling/interaction with other types (fan-in/fan-out = 0, few listed dependencies). These characteristics do not suggest an under-decomposed or overly large class, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
