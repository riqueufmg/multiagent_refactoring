    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is moderate (116) and not extremely large; number of methods is zero (nom = 0) and weighted method count is zero (wmc = 0), so there is no concentrated complex behavior to split into smaller classes or methods; number of fields is modest (nof = 7) and coupling appears low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Dependency list is limited and does not show an excessive variety of responsibilities. LCOM value is -1.0 (no clear evidence of low cohesion). Overall the data shows no clear signs that the class is excessively large, complex, or handling multiple responsibilities that would justify further decomposition."
