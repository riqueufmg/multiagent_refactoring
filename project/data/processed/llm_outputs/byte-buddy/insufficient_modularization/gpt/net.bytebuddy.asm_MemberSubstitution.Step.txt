    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Step",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Evidence of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 4013) and an extremely high number of fields (nof = 191) indicate the class likely encapsulates many responsibilities and should be decomposed. The class depends on a large set of distinct components (21 listed dependencies), suggesting it touches many different concerns. These factors (high LOC, very high field count, and many external dependencies) justify flagging the class for further decomposition into smaller, more focused modules."
