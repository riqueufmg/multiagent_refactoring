    "justification": "The class is very small and already simple: LOC=13, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method count (wmc)=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no implementation complexity indicators suggesting a need for further decomposition. Given these metrics and the single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription), there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
