    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed large or complex class: LOC=65 (moderate size), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods and no measured complexity), NOF=2 (only two fields), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling evidence). LCOM=-1.0 does not signal a cohesion problem here. Given the absence of methods, low complexity, and minimal coupling/dependencies, there is no clear indication that the class requires further decomposition."
