    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=49), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0) indicate trivial implementation; only three fields (nof=3); low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and minimal dependencies. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
