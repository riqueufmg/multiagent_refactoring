    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has relatively large size by lines of code (loc = 217), other indicators do not support Insufficient Modularization. The class has very few methods (nom = 2) and low cyclomatic/weighted method count (wmc = 2), indicating simple internal logic. Cohesion is high (lcom = -1.0), showing related responsibilities are grouped. Coupling is low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and inheritance depth is minimal (dit = 1). Number of fields (nof = 7) and the listed dependencies do not by themselves imply multiple unrelated responsibilities. Taken in isolation, these metrics suggest the class is cohesive and not a candidate for further decomposition."
