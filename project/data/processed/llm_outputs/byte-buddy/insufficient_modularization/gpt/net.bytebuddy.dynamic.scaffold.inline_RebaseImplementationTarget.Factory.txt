    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.RebaseImplementationTarget.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=22, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1 and no public/protected methods (NOPM=0). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no detected inheritance complexity (DIT=0). Given these metrics and the listed dependencies, the class does not exhibit size or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
