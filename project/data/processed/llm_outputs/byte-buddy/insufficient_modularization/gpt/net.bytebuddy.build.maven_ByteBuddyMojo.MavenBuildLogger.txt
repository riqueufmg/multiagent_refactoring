    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no indicators of insufficient modularization: it has only 1 field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and no measurable complexity (wmc=0). Its size is modest (loc=88) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Inheritance depth is low (dit=1) and cohesion metric does not indicate fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). These elements suggest the class is simple and does not require further decomposition."
