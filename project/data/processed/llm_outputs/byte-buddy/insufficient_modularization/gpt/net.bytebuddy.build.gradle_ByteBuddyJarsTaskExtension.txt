    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=42), limited number of methods (nom=7, public methods=3), moderate cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=7), and good cohesion (lcom=0.4286). Low coupling is indicated by fanin=0 and fanout=0, and shallow inheritance (dit=1, nc=0). These values suggest the class is reasonably small, cohesive, and not overly complex, so there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
