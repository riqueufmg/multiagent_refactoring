    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 114) while exposing many external relationships (dependencies: AnnotationValue, ParameterDescription, AnnotationList, ParameterList, TypeList, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, CachedReturnPlugin). This combination (moderate-to-large LOC with multiple distinct dependency types) indicates multiple responsibilities and potential for further decomposition. Additional signals: cohesion metric is unavailable/invalid (lcom = -1.0) and method-level counts are zero (nom = 0, nopm = 0), preventing confirmation of focused, cohesive behavior; therefore the evidence supports Insufficient Modularization."
