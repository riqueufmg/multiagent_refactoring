    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: loc=34, nom=3, wmc=4 and nof=1, which indicate a compact implementation. Coupling indicators show no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LCOM=0.666 shows only moderate cohesion, the overall size and low complexity do not justify further decomposition; there is insufficient evidence that splitting would reduce complexity or size."
