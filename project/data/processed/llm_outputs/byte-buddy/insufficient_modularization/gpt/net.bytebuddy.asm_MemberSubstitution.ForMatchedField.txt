    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMatchedField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=66), has no methods (nom=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0), only three fields (nof=3), zero coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (dit=0). These metrics indicate limited responsibility and low complexity, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided data."
