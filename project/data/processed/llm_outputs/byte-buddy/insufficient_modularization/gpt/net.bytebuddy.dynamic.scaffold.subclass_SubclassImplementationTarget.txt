    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.SubclassImplementationTarget",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization: LOC is moderate (104), number of methods is small (nom = 5) and weighted method count is low (wmc = 5), indicating limited implementation complexity. The class has few fields (nof = 2) and a single modestly high cohesion measure (lcom = 0.8) but not combined with high size or complexity to justify further decomposition. Fan-in/fan-out are 0, and dependencies are limited to a small set of related types, so there is no evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities or excessive size that would require splitting the class."
