    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: loc=57 (small), nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods to split), wmc=0 (no complexity), nof=2 (only two fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling). Dependencies are limited to three types but do not imply excessive responsibility. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
