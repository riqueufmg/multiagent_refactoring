    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForOrigin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 289) combined with a high number of fields (nof = 11) and many public fields (nopf = 6) while exposing no methods (nom = 0) and zero WMC (wmc = 0). This suggests data/state is concentrated without associated behavior. The cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) is non‑positive, indicating low/undefined cohesion, and the class depends on multiple external types (listed dependencies), implying it may be handling multiple responsibilities. Together these metrics justify that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and could be split into smaller, more cohesive units."
