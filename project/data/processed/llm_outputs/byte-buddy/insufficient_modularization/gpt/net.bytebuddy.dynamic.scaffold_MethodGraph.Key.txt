    "justification": "Detected: the class is excessively large and likely contains multiple responsibilities. Evidence from provided metrics: loc = 776 (very high size), nof = 23 (many fields), nom = 0 (no top-level methods reported, suggesting internal complexity or many nested/combined responsibilities rather than clean decomposition). lcom = -1.0 (cohesion not meaningfully positive), with zero fanin/fanout does not mitigate the size/field count. These signs, considered in isolation, support Insufficient Modularization."
