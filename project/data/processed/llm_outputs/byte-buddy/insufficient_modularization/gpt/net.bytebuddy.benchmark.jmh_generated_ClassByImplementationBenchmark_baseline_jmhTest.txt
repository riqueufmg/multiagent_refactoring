    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_baseline_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows a strong sign of insufficient modularization: extremely high number of fields (nof=263) combined with very few methods (nom=9, nopm=8) and modest size (loc=276). The implementation complexity is non-trivial (wmc=42) while there is no inheritance or external modularization indicated (dit=0, nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The large field-to-method imbalance suggests the class is a monolithic data/behavior container that would benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
