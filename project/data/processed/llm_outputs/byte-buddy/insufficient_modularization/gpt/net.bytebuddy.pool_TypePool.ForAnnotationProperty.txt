    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is modest (51), number of fields is small (3) and number of methods is 0, WMC is 0 (no measured internal complexity), LCOM = -1.0 suggests high cohesion, and fan-in/fan-out are 0 indicating low coupling. Dependencies are minimal. There is no evidence from these isolated metrics that the class is overly large or complex and requires further decomposition."
