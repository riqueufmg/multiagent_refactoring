    "justification": "The class is very small and self-contained: LOC=11, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), cyclomatic complexity WMC=0, low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metrics are not applicable given the absence of members. Given its minimal size and complexity (and only a single external dependency), there is no evidence that it must be further decomposed, so it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
