    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 400) while containing multiple fields (nof = 7), which suggests it carries multiple responsibilities. It also depends on several external types (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher), indicating mixed concerns. The absence of methods in the metrics (nom = 0) combined with high LOC suggests internal complexity or embedded functionality that would be better decomposed. These elements together indicate Insufficient Modularization."
