    "justification": "The class is small and non-complex: LOC=14, WMC=0, NOM=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. Although it has 12 fields (NOF=12), there are no methods or measurable complexity to reduce by further decomposition. Given the very low size and complexity metrics, further modularization is unlikely to reduce size or implementation complexity."
