    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForRawType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple in isolation: LOC=34, WMC=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=1 (minimal fields). Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0) with a single listed dependency. Cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate low cohesion. Given the low size, zero complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
