    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=46, WMC=5 (low complexity), nom=5 methods (nopm=4 public), and a single field (nof=1). Coupling and dependencies are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=0). Although LCOM=0.8 indicates only moderate cohesion, the overall low size and low complexity mean there is insufficient evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
