    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.FieldGetter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows low internal complexity and size: LOC=79, NOF(fields)=3, NOM(methods)=0, WMC=0. There are no methods to decompose (NOM=0) and cyclomatic/implementation complexity is zero (WMC=0). Although several external types are listed as dependencies, the coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) do not indicate internal entanglement that would benefit from further decomposition. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is insufficient evidence of an undecomposed, complex class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
