    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForDynamicConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has substantial size (loc=121) and a large number of fields (nof=16) while declaring no methods (nom=0). This combination suggests multiple responsibilities or bundled state that have not been decomposed. The class also depends on several distinct types (ParameterDescription, JavaConstant, MethodDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, AnnotationDescription), indicating it interacts with diverse concerns. These metrics (high LOC, high NOF, multiple external dependencies, zero methods) support the presence of Insufficient Modularization and that the class could be further decomposed."
