    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is relatively large (loc = 309) with non-trivial complexity (wmc = 16); it defines 10 methods (9 public) and 10 fields, exposing many behaviors and state; it contains or relies on multiple internal roles (nested/related types MethodLoading, TypeCastingHandler, NoOp) and a wide set of responsibilities as shown by its dependencies (ParameterDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDefinition, StackManipulation, StackSize), indicating multiple concerns; cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.3). Together these metrics suggest the class has multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
