    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class shows no clear signs of being insufficiently modular. Metrics indicate small size (LOC=78), no methods (nom=0) and no complexity (WMC=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and limited dependencies. Although it has 5 fields, that alone does not imply multiple responsibilities or an undecomposed design. There is insufficient evidence from the provided metrics to justify further decomposition."
