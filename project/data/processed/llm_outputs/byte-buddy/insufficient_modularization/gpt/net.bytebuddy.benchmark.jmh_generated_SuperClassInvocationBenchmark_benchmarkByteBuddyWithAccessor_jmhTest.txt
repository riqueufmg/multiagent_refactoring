    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithAccessor_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class has an extremely high number of fields (nof=263) while exposing a small number of methods (nom=9, nopm=8), together with sizable size and complexity (loc=276, wmc=42). The disproportion between very large state (many fields) and relatively few operations, plus overall LOC/WMC, indicates the class aggregates too much responsibility and state and could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
