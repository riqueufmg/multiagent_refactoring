    "justification": "Although the class has 131 LOC, it shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: nom (number of methods) = 1 and wmc (cyclomatic complexity) = 1 indicate a single, low-complexity behavioral surface; lcom = -1.0 indicates high cohesion; nof = 5 (few fields) does not imply excessive state; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show no coupling that would benefit from splitting. Taken in isolation, these metrics do not justify further decomposition."
