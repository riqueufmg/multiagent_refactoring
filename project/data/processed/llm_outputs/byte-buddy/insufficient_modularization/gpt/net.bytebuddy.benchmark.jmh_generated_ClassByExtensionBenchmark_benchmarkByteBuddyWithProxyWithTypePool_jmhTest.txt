    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very high number of fields (nof = 263) and relatively large size (loc = 276) while exposing few methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8). Combined with a high cyclomatic/maintenance load (wmc = 42), this indicates the class holds many responsibilities/state elements that could be split into smaller classes or components. The large fields-to-methods ratio (263 fields for 9 methods) especially suggests fragmentation of state across a single class and motivates decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
