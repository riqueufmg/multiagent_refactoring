    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=15, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods or fields to decompose and coupling is minimal (only two listed dependencies). Given the lack of size, complexity, and cohesion issues, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
