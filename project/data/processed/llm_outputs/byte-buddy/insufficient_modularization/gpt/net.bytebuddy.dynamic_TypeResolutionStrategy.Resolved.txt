    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=41, number of fields (nof)=2, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method count (wmc)=0. Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no inheritance depth (dit=0). Given the low size and complexity metrics and lack of methods to decompose, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
