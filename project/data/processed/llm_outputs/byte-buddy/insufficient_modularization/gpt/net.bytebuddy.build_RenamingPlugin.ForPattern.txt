    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=39, number of fields=2, number of methods=0 (nom=0), WMC=0, LCOM not indicating cohesion issues, and no coupling pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0). It has only a single listed dependency. These metrics show low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
