    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Analyzed in isolation: the class has moderate size (loc=117) but zero methods (nom=0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0), indicating little or no behavioral implementation to decompose. It has a small number of fields (nof=5) and no coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is -1.0 (not indicating cohesion issues here). Given the absence of method-level complexity and low coupling, there is no clear evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from further decomposition."
