    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear insufficient modularization. Although it has 14 methods (nom = 14) and a total cyclomatic weight of 19 (wmc = 19), its size is small (loc = 124 → ~8.9 LOC/method) and average complexity per method is low (wmc/nom ≈ 1.36). Cohesion is acceptable (lcom = 0.2857), there are only 4 fields (nof = 4), no nested classes (nc = 0), shallow inheritance (dit = 1), and no measured external coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics indicate a compact, cohesive class rather than a large, poorly decomposed one, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
