    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=43, number of fields=1 (nof=1), number of methods=0 (nom=0), WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There is no internal behavioral complexity or size that indicates an opportunity for further decomposition. Based on these isolated metrics, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
