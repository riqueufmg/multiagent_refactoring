    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=32, WMC=0, NOM=0. Coupling and usage are minimal: fanin=0, fanout=0, and only two external type dependencies. There is no evidence of high implementation complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
