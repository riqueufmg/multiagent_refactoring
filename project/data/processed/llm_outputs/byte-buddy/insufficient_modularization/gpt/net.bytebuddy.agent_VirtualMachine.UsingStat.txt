    "justification": "Not detected: the class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized given the provided metrics. It contains only 3 fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0). Its size is moderate (loc=71) but with zero method complexity and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metrics are not applicable for this structure. With no methods to decompose and no internal complexity, there is no evidence from the provided data that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
