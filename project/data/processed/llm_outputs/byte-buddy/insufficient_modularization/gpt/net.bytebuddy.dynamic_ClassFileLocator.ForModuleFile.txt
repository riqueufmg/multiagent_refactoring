    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForModuleFile",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization because its size is relatively large (loc = 149) while showing signs of multiple responsibilities and limited decomposition: it has 3 fields (nof = 3) but zero reported methods (nom = 0 / nopm = 0), which suggests long/complex implementation blocks or nested behavior rather than well-factored small methods. The inheritance depth is shallow (dit = 1) so behavior is not being separated via specialization, and the reported cohesion metric is non-standard (lcom = -1.0), indicating unclear or low cohesion. The class depends on multiple utilities (net.bytebuddy.utility.StreamDrainer and net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), suggesting it handles both I/O-related concerns and equality/hash responsibilities. Finally, its fanin/fanout are 0, indicating it is self-contained and can likely be refactored into smaller modules without wide impact. These elements together justify that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
