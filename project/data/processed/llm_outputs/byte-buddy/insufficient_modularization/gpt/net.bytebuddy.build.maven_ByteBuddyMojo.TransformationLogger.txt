    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=31, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1, DIT=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency), and cohesion metric is not indicating internal complexity (LCOM=-1.0). With no methods and very low size/complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
