    "justification": "Not detected: although the class has 107 LOC, it shows no methods (nom = 0) and only 5 fields (nof = 5). Complexity metrics are minimal (wmc = 0), coupling is low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and there are only a few external dependencies. There is no metric evidence of high implementation complexity or multiple responsibilities that would indicate the need for further decomposition."
