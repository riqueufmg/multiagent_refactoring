    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Resolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=35), few methods (nom=2, nopm=1) and fields (nof=1), low complexity (WMC=4), high cohesion (LCOM=1.0), no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already small, cohesive, and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided data."
