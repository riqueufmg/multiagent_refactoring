    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.MethodConstant.PrivilegedLookup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC is small (57), number of methods is zero (nom: 0) with cyclomatic/implementation complexity low (wmc: 0), low coupling (fanin: 0, fanout: 0), shallow inheritance (dit: 1). Although there are several external dependencies listed, the class itself shows low size and complexity, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
