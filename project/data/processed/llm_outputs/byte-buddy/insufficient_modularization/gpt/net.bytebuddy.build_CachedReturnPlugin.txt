    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Insufficient modularization detected: the class is large (loc=260) while exposing few methods (nom=5, nopm=5) and a moderate cyclomatic burden (wmc=11), indicating large/complex methods. It declares many fields (nof=11) but few methods, producing a high field-to-method ratio and suggesting multiple responsibilities. Cohesion is low (lcom=0.8), showing related behavior is not well concentrated. The class depends on a wide variety of unrelated subsystems (19 dependencies, e.g. net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice), which implies it mixes responsibilities across different concerns. These factors together justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
