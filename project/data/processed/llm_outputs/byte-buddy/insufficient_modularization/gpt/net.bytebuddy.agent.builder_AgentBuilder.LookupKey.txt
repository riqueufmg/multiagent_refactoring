    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LookupKey",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: it is small (LOC=39), has only 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods reported (nom=0, nopm=0), very low structural complexity (WMC=0), and no coupling to other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). These metrics indicate the class is simple and not a candidate for further decomposition."
