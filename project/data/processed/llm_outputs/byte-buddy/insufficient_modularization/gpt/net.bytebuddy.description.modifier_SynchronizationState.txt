    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class: small size (LOC=46), low complexity (WMC=5), few methods (NOM=5) and fields (NOF=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency), no inheritance depth (DIT=0). Cohesion (LCOM=0.8) is not accompanied by high size or complexity that would justify further decomposition. Therefore there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
