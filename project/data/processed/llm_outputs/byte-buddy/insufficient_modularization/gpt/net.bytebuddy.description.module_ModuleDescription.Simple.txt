    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: very small size (loc = 22), only 1 field (nof = 1), no methods (nom = 0 / nopm = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), and no coupling indicated (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). LCOM = -1 is a non-informative value here but with no methods there is nothing to decompose. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
