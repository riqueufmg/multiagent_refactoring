    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=19, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0) and coupling is low (fanout=0, fanin=0, single dependency on net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition). No deep inheritance (DIT=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not need further decomposition."
