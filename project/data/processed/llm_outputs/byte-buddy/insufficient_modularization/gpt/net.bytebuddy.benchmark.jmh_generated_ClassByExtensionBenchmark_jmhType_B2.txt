    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_jmhType_B2",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: it is very small (loc=14), has no methods (nom=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it contains a single compilation unit (nc=1). Although it has 12 fields (nof=12, nopf=12), the lack of methods, low LOC, and low complexity indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
