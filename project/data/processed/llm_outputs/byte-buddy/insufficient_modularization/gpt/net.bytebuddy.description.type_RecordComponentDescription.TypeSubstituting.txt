    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=64, number of fields=3 (nof=3), number of methods=0 (nom=0), weighted methods complexity WMC=0, coupling low (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only a few dependencies (RecordComponentDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDescription). LCOM=-1.0 shows no detected cohesion problem. Given the small size, absence of method complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
