    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show a small, low-complexity class: LOC=33, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=3. Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no methods to further decompose. These elements indicate the class is already small and cohesive, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
