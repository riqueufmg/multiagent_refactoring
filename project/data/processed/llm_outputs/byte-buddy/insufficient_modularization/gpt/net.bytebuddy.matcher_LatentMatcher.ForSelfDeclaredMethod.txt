    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized when considered in isolation: very small size (loc=27), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not need further decomposition."
