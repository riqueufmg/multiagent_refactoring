    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.BridgeMethodImplementation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=56), very low complexity (wmc=0), no methods to split (nom=0), only three fields (nof=3), minimal inheritance depth (dit=1), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not indicate poor cohesion. Although there are a few external type references, the class's limited size and complexity mean further decomposition is not justified based on the provided metrics."
