    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.IntegerConstant.ConstantPool",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: loc=23, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 and lcom=-1.0 (no method cohesion applicable). These metrics indicate minimal size, no implementation complexity, and low coupling, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
