    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization because it has a relatively large size (loc = 162) while showing no method-level decomposition (nom = 0, wmc = 0) and only a small number of fields (nof = 2). The mismatch between high LOC and zero declared methods suggests implementation is not properly decomposed into smaller methods or helper classes. The class also depends on multiple external types (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription), indicating multiple responsibilities or interactions that could be separated. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
