    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC 39, WMC 5, NOM 5, and only 1 field (NOF 1). It has no external coupling (fanin 0, fanout 0) and a shallow inheritance depth (DIT 2). Although LCOM 0.8 suggests some cohesion concerns, the low size, low complexity, and minimal state do not indicate an incomplete decomposition that would benefit from further modularization in isolation."
