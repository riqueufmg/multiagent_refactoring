    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC is moderate (64), number of fields is small (nof=3), and there are no methods (nom=0) or method complexity (wmc=0) to suggest a large, complex implementation. Coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) are low and cohesion metric does not show high lack of cohesion (lcom=-1.0 as provided). The listed external dependencies do not imply internal size or complexity that would require further decomposition. Given the absence of large method count, high complexity, many fields, or evidence of low cohesion, there is insufficient evidence to detect Insufficient Modularization."
