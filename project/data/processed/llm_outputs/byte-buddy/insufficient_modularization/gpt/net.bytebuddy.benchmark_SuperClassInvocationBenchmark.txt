    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a moderate size (LOC=265) and a relatively high field count (NOF=16), other indicators do not support Insufficient Modularization. The number of methods is modest (NOM=8) and overall complexity is low (WMC=8), indicating methods are not complex. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0), implying related functionality is grouped rather than multiple unrelated responsibilities. There are no public fields (NOPF=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). Taken in isolation, these metrics suggest the class is cohesive and not a candidate for further decomposition, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
