    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, simple class: LOC=60, number of fields=3, number of methods=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. Low size (60 LOC), zero/very low complexity (WMC=0) and minimal coupling (fanin/fanout=0, only 2 declared dependencies) do not suggest an undecomposed, overly large or complex class. The lack of methods and low field count imply no substantial implementation that should be further modularized. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
