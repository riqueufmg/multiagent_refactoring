    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.StubMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=38, NOM=5, WMC=5. There are no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0) and low inheritance depth (DIT=1). LCOM=-1.0 suggests good cohesion among methods. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, and the class depends on a limited set of types. Given the low size, modest complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
