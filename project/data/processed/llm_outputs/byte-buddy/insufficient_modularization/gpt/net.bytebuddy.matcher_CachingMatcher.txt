    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. Metrics indicate small size and low complexity (loc=81, nom=4, wmc=5) and high cohesion (lcom=0.0). It has few fields (nof=4) and few external collaborators (nc=1, dependencies=[net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin]), with no inheritance depth (dit=0). Fan-in/fan-out are zero, so there is no evidence of a large, tangled interface. Given the low method count, low cyclomatic complexity, and perfect cohesion, further decomposition is not justified."
