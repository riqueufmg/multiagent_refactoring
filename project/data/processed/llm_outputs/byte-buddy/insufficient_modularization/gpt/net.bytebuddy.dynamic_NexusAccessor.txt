    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 243) with a small number of methods (nom = 6) indicates very large/complex method bodies that could be split; a moderate WMC (7) combined with high LOC suggests concentrated complexity; number of fields (nof = 6) and moderate cohesion (lcom = 0.5) imply multiple responsibilities or state clusters that could be separated; the class declares nested types (NexusAccessor.Dispatcher, NexusAccessor.CreationAction) and depends on many external types (multiple entries in dependencies), which indicates it aggregates several concerns. These elements together justify decomposing the class into smaller, more focused classes."
