    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show no methods or behavior to decompose (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although loc=92, the absence of methods and an LCOM of -1.0 indicate no cohesion or complexity issues within the class itself. Dependencies are limited and do not imply internal size/complexity that would require further decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
