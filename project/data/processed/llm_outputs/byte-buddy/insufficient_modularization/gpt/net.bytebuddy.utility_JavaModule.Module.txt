    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule.Module",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=66 (moderate size), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no implemented methods / no internal complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling indicating multiple responsibilities), and only one listed dependency. There is no evidence of high complexity, many methods, or heavy coupling that would indicate the class should be further decomposed."
