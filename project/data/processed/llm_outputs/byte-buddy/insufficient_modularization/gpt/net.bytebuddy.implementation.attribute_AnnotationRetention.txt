    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=36, NOM=3 (NOPM=2), WMC=3 (low complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). It has no inheritance (DIT=0) and no coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size, low complexity and high cohesion, further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or implementation complexity."
