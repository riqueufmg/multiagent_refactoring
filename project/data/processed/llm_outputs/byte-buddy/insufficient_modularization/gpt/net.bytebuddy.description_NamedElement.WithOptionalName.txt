    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=10), no fields (nof=0) and no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. DIT=1 and LCOM=-1.0 indicate a trivial/cohesive unit. These metrics provide no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
