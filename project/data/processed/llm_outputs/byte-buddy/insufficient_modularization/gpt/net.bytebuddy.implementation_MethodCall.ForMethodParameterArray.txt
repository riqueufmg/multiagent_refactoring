    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForMethodParameterArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=67), has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), and no reported coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is overly large or complex and in need of further decomposition."
