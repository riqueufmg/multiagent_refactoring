    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingLookup",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has substantial size (loc = 148) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc = 0), yet it declares 4 fields (nof = 4). This combination (large LOC with no method decomposition) indicates logic is not broken into smaller methods or subcomponents and is likely concentrated in initializers or large blocks. LCOM is unavailable (-1.0), preventing cohesion assessment, but the presence of multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType) suggests multiple responsibilities that could be separated. Fanin and fanout are 0, so the class is not highly coupled externally, strengthening the case that its internal size/complexity should be reduced via further decomposition. On this basis, insufficient modularization is detected."
