    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, non-complex class: LOC=49, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPF=0, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods or fields to decompose and no coupling to other components (only dependency to enclosing TypeDescription). Given the low size and zero measured complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
