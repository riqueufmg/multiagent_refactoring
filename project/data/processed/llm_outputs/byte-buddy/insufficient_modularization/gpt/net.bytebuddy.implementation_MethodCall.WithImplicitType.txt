    "justification": "The class is small and contains no detectable internal responsibilities: LOC=22, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. These metrics indicate no fields, no methods, no cyclomatic complexity and no coupling to other classes beyond a single dependency. In isolation, there is no evidence of an undecomposed, large or complex implementation that would benefit from further modularization."
