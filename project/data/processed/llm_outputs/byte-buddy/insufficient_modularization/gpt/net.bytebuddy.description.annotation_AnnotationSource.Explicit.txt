    "justification": "The class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=29, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=1 (single field), WMC=0 (no measured complexity), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling), DIT=1. These metrics indicate minimal size and complexity, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
