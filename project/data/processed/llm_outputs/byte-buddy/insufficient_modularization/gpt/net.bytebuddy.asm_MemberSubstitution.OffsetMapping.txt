    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OffsetMapping",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large source size (loc = 2356), an extremely high number of fields (nof = 142) and a large set of external dependencies (17 listed). These metrics indicate the class likely contains multiple responsibilities/state and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
