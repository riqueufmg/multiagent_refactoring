    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large or complex class: LOC is modest (81), there are no declared methods (nom = 0) and zero measured complexity (wmc = 0). Field count is small (nof = 5) and coupling is low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Inheritance depth is minimal (dit = 1) and cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) does not show low cohesion. Based on these elements taken in isolation, there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization."
