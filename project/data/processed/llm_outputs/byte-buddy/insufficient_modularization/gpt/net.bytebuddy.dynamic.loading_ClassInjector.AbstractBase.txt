    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC is only 57 (small size), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods/low complexity), NOF = 1 (single field), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling signals), DIT = 1 (shallow inheritance). LCOM = -1.0 does not suggest poor cohesion here. Given these elements (small size, minimal state/behavior, and low coupling/complexity) there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
