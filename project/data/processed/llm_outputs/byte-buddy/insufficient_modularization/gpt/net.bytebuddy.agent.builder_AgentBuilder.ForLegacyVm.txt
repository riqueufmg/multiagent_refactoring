    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal complexity: LOC = 13, NOM = 0, WMC = 0. It has no fields or methods reported (NOF = 0, NOM = 0) and no measured coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). LCOM = -1.0 indicates cohesion metric not applicable. Given the lack of code, complexity, or responsibilities to split, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
