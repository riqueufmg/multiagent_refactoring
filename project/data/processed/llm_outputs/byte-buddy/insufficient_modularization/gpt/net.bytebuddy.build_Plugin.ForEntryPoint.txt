    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=28, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0 and only 2 fields (NOF=2). Cohesion/complexity indicators show no implemented behavior (NOM=0, WMC=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics and the limited dependency list, there is no evidence this class is a large/complex holder that would benefit from further decomposition."
