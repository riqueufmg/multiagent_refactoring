    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Multiple indicators show insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 274) combined with a high number of fields (nof = 14) but few methods (nom = 5) suggests the class holds a lot of state/responsibilities with little behavior per responsibility. Cohesion is relatively low (LCOM = 0.8), implying the members are not tightly focused on a single responsibility. The class has many external dependencies (16 listed), indicating it interacts with many concerns. The presence of an inner role (AccessControllerPlugin.Initializer in the dependency list) further suggests multiple responsibilities are grouped in one unit. WMC is low (6), so complexity is not the cause of size — the class is large primarily due to accumulated responsibilities and state, which favors decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
