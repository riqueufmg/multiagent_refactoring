    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.InMemory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 143 LOC but reports 0 methods (nom=0) and WMC=0 while having only 1 field (nof=1). A relatively large size with no methods or measured complexity indicates code is not decomposed into smaller, focused methods or helper classes. This mismatch (high LOC vs. zero methods/complexity) is a strong indicator of insufficient modularization: the implementation is likely monolithic and would benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
