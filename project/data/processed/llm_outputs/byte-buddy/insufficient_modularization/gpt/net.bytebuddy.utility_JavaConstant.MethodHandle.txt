    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.MethodHandle",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it occupies 522 LOC (large size for a single class) and declares 11 fields, indicating substantial internal state and likely multiple responsibilities. It appears as a nested class in JavaConstant (file: data/repositories/byte-buddy/byte-buddy-dep/src/main/java/net/bytebuddy/utility/JavaConstant.java), and it depends on many external types (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, JavaDispatcher, TypeList, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, TypeDescription, ClassFileVersion, AccessControllerPlugin, JavaType), suggesting it coordinates varied concerns. These elements (high LOC, numerous fields, and broad dependency set) justify decomposing the class into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and implementation complexity."
