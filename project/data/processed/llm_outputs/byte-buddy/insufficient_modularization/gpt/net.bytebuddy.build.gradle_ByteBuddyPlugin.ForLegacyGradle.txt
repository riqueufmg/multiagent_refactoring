    "justification": "Class is small and simple in isolation: LOC=25, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPM=0. Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion concerns given the lack of members. Given the low size and complexity metrics, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
