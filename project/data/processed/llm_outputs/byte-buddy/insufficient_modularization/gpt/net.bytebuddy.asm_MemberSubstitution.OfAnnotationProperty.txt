    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=57), no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted method count (wmc=0) indicate low internal complexity, only 2 fields (nof=2), no inheritance depth (dit=0), and no coupling measured (fanin=0, fanout=0). The listed dependencies are external references but do not imply internal decomposition needs. Based on these metrics in isolation, further decomposition is not warranted."
