    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForBuildEntryPoint",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being a large or complex unit that requires decomposition: LOC=22, number of methods (nom)=0, cyclomatic/weighted method complexity (wmc)=0, single field (nof=1), and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependency set is small. These metrics indicate a tiny, simple class with no measurable internal complexity or size that would justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
