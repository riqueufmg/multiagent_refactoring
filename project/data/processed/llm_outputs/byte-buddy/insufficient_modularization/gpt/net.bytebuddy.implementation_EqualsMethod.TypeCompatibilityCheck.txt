    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=30, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=1, WMC=0. Coupling appears minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and the dependency list is limited. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or high cohesion/low cohesion that would justify further decomposition when the class is considered in isolation."
