    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an insufficiently modular class: size is modest (loc=81), cyclomatic/complexity is minimal (wmc=0), there are no reported methods or fields (nof=0, nom=0) and cohesion metric is not indicating low cohesion (lcom=-1.0 likely not computed). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two dependencies are listed. These factors do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
