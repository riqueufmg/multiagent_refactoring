    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class size is large (loc=153) which suggests multiple responsibilities that could be split; no methods reported (nom=0) and wmc=0 despite large LOC — an unusual combination implying functionality is not cleanly decomposed into methods or subcomponents; the class depends on multiple external concerns (MethodGraph, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, ClassFileVersion) indicating it interacts with diverse responsibilities that could be modularized; LCOM=-1.0 (metric not meaningful) together with the other indicators points to likely low/unclear cohesion and supports recommending further decomposition."
