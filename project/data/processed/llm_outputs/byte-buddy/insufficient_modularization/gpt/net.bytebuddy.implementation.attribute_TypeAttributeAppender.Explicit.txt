    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=25, no methods (nom=0), one field (nof=1), low complexity (WMC=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
