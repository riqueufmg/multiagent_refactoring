    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=26), low complexity (wmc=3), few methods (nom=3, nopm=2) and only one field (nof=1). High cohesion (lcom=0.0) and no external coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics in isolation indicate the class is already small and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
