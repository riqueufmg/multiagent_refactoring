    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, large or complex class: LOC is 92 (moderate size) but NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods/complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling evidence), DIT=2 (shallow inheritance). Given the absence of methods and low complexity/coupling, there is no evidence here of Insufficient Modularization."
