    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=29, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and only 2 external dependencies. There are no methods or measurable complexity to suggest a need for further decomposition. LCOM is non-applicable (-1.0). Based on these elements in isolation, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
