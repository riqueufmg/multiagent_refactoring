    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and not complex in isolation (LOC=79, #fields=3, #methods=0, WMC=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Given these metrics, there is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
