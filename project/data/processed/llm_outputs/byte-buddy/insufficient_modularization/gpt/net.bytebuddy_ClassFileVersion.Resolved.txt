    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion.Resolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=22, nof=1 (minimal state), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods/low complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only lightweight dependencies listed (net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These metrics indicate the class does not require further decomposition."
