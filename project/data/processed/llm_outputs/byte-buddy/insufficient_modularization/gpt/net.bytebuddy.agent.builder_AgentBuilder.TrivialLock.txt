    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.TrivialLock",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is minimal and does not show signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc = 9), no methods (nom = 0) and no complexity (wmc = 0), only one field (nof = 1), zero incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given these metrics and no dependencies, there is no evidence that the class contains multiple responsibilities or high implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
