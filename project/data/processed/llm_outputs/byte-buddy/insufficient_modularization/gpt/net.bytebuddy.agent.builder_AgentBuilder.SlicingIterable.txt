    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization when analyzed in isolation. Although LOC = 106, there are no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and WMC = 0, indicating no concentrated implementation complexity to decompose. Field count (nof = 7) is moderate and LCOM = -1.0 is not informative here. Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and there are no external dependencies. Together these metrics indicate a lack of internal complexity or mixed responsibilities that would motivate further decomposition."
