    "justification": "The class concentrates a very large amount of state and complexity in a single unit: NOF=263 (very high number of fields) while NOM=9 and NOPM=8 (few methods). LOC=276 and WMC=42 indicate substantial size and implementation complexity. The extremely high field-to-method ratio (263 fields vs 9 methods) and large LOC imply multiple responsibilities or large internal structure that has not been decomposed. These characteristics match Insufficient Modularization: the class can be further split into smaller classes to reduce size and complexity."
