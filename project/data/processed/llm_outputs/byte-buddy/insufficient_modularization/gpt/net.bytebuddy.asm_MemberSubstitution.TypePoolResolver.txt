    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed, high-complexity class. Although LOC is 91, the class has 0 methods (nom = 0) and a very low complexity (wmc = 0), only 3 fields (nof = 3), and no measured coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Dependency count is small (3). These factors suggest there is no concentrated implementation complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
