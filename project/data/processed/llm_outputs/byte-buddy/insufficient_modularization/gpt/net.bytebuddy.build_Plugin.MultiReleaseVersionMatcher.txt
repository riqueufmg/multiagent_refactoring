    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=39 (small size), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods/low complexity), NOF=1 (single field), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling pressure), LCOM=-1.0 (indicates cohesion rather than lack of it), DIT=1. Given the class is minimal in size, complexity, and responsibilities, there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
