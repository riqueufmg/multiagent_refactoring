    "justification": "The class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: loc=38, nom=0 (no methods), nof=1 (single field), wmc=0 (no measured complexity). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
