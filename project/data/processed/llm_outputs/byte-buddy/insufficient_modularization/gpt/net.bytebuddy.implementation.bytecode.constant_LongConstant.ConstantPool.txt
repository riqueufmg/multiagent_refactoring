    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.LongConstant.ConstantPool",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=23, 1 field, 0 methods, WMC=0, no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), DIT=0. Given the very low size and complexity metrics and absence of responsibilities to decompose, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization when the class is considered in isolation."
