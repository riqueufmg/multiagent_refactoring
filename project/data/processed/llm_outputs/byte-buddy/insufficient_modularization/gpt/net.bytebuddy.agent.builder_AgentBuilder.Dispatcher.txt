    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=18, WMC=0, no fields/methods reported (nof=0, nom=0), and cohesion does not indicate internal decomposition needs (LCOM=-1.0). Coupling appears minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition despite the listed external dependencies."
