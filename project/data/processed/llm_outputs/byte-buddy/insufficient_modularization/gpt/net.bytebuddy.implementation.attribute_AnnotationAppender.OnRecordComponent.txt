    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender.OnRecordComponent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=28), only one field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is zero (dit=0). Given these metrics and the single dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
