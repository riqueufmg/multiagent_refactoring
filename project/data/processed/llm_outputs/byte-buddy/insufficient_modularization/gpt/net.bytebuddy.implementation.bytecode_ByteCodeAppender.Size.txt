    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, simple class: LOC=48, no methods (nom=0) and WMC=0 (no implementation complexity), only 3 fields (nof=3, nopf=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no meaningful dependencies beyond an annotation plugin. Given its small size, lack of complex behavior, and low coupling, there is no evidence that this class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
