    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being under-modularized: LOC=13, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=0 (no fields), WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and no dependencies. It contains no behavior or state that could be further decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
