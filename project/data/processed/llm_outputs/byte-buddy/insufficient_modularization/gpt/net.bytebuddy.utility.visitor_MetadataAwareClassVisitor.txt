    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size and complexity indicate insufficient decomposition: LOC = 332, NOM = 39, WMC = 44. The class exposes a large API surface (NOPM = 14) while having few fields (NOF = 5), suggesting many behaviors concentrated in one class rather than split across smaller modules. DIT = 0 and fanin/fanout = 0 indicate functionality is concentrated in this class rather than delegated, reinforcing the need for further decomposition. Although LCOM = 0.0 implies cohesion, the absolute size and complexity metrics (LOC, NOM, WMC) justify refactoring into smaller, more modular classes."
