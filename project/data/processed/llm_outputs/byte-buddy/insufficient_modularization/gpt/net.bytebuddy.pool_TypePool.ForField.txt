    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, simple class: LOC=36, number of fields=1, number of methods=0 (nom=0), weighted method complexity=0 (wmc=0), coupling/frequency metrics fanin=0 and fanout=0, and low/no cohesion issues reported (lcom=-1.0). Given the lack of methods, low size and complexity, and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization."
