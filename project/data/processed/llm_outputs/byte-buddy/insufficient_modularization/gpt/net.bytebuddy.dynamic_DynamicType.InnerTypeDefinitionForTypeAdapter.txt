    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=31, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=1 (single field), WMC=0 (no complexity). It shows minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
