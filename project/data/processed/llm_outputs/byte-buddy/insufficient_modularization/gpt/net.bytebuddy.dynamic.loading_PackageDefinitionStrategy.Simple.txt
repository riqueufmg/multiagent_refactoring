    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy.Simple",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class shows signs of insufficient decomposition: relatively large size (loc = 131) combined with a high number of fields (nof = 7) and no methods (nom = 0). This indicates substantial internal content concentrated in a single class (potential multiple responsibilities or data clusters) that could be split into smaller, more cohesive units. Additional metrics (wmc = 0, lcom = -1.0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0) do not contradict this assessment when the class is considered in isolation."
