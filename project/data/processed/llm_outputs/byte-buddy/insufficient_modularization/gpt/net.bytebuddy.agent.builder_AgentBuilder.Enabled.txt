    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=89 (moderate size), NOF=2 (only two fields), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods and no measured complexity), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling in/out). With few fields, no methods, low complexity and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
