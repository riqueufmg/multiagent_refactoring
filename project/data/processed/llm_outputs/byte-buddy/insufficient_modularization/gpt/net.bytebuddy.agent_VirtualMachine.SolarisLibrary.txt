    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: LOC=77 with only 6 fields (nof=6, nopf=6) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and WMC=0. Coupling is nil (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. The class has low implementation complexity and no method-level responsibilities to decompose, so there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
