    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=22, NOM=2, NOF=1, WMC=2, LCOM=0.0. It has no inheritance (DIT=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and only a single dependency. These metrics indicate low size and complexity and high cohesion, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
