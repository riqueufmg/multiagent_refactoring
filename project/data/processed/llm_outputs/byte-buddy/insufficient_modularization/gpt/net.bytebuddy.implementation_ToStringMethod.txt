    "justification": "Detected based on multiple indicators of a class that is too large and has mixed responsibilities: LOC = 605 (very large implementation size); NOF = 15 (many fields/state held by the class); NOM = 11 with WMC = 15 (substantial behavioural complexity spread across methods); LCOM = 0.545 (only moderate cohesion, suggesting multiple responsibilities); presence of multiple inner/related types named in dependencies (ToStringMethod.Default, ToStringMethod.PrefixResolver, ToStringMethod.ValueConsumer, ToStringMethod.Appender) and many external dependencies (e.g. Implementation, InstrumentedType, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, StackManipulation, Duplication) which together indicate the class is handling several distinct concerns that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
