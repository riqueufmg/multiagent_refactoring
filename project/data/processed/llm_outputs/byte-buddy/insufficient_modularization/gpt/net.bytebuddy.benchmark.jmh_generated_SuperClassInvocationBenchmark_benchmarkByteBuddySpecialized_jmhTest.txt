    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddySpecialized_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very high number of fields (nof = 263) combined with substantial size (loc = 276) and elevated complexity (wmc = 42) despite a relatively small number of methods (nom = 9). The disproportionate field count relative to methods and overall size suggests the class aggregates many responsibilities or data elements that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or modules."
