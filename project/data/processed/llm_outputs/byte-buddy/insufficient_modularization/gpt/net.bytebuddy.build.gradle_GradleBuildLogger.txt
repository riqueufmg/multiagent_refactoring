    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=88 (small), NOM=13 and WMC=13 (moderate complexity, average ~6.8 LOC per method), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion), NOF=1 (single field), DIT=1 and NC=0 (no nested types), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling). Given the class size, cohesion, and low coupling, there is no strong evidence that it needs further decomposition."
