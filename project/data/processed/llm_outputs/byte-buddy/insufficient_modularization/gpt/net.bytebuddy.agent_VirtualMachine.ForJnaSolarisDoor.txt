    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.ForJnaSolarisDoor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High class size (loc = 225) combined with a relatively large number of fields (nof = 11, nopf = 6) and zero methods (nom = 0) indicates the class contains substantial data/implementation that has not been decomposed. The large LOC with no behavioral decomposition suggests multiple responsibilities or bulky initialization/code that could be split into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and complexity. Other metrics (wmc = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0) do not contradict this; given the class in isolation, the primary indicators (LOC and many fields with no methods) justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
