    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription.ForLoadedField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=55, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method count (wmc)=0, number of fields (nof)=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it depends on only three external types. These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed."
