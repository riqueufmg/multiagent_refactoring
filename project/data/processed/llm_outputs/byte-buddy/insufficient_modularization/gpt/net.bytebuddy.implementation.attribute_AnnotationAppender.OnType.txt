    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=28, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, DIT=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. There are no methods to decompose and only a single field/dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
