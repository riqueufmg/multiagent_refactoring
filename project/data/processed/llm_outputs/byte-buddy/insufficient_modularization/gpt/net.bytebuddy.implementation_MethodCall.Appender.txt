    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC=84 (small), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no measurable behavioral complexity or methods to decompose), NOF=6 (moderate number of fields but not large), DIT=1 (shallow inheritance), LCOM=-1.0 (no signal of low cohesion here), fan-in=0 and fan-out=0 (low coupling). Dependencies are limited. There is no evidence from these metrics that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
