    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and trivial: LOC=21, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0. Coupling is negligible (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). Cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) does not provide evidence of low cohesion and may be invalid here. There are no signs of high complexity, many methods, or multiple responsibilities that would suggest further decomposition is needed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
