    "justification": "Class shows low size and complexity: LOC=23, WMC=0, NOF=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, NC=0. Cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion concerns), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 2 listed dependencies). Given the absence of fields and methods and low complexity/size, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
