    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=28, NOF=1, NOM=0, NOPM=0, WMC=0 indicate minimal size and complexity. DIT=0 and LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issues reported) and fanin=0, fanout=0 show low coupling. Dependencies are limited (3 types) and do not imply excessive responsibility. Therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
