    "justification": "Not detected: class is minimal in size and complexity (LOC=24, WMC=0), has no methods (nom=0) and only one field (nof=1). Coupling is negligible (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader). These metrics indicate the class is already small and simple and does not show signs of insufficient modularization."
