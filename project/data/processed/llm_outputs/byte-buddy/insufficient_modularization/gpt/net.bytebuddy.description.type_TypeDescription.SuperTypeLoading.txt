    "justification": "The class shows signs of excessive size and multiple responsibilities: LOC = 360 (large implementation size) while nom = 0 and nopm = 0 (no reported methods) and nof = 9 (several fields) — this imbalance suggests a single large unit that has not been decomposed. The dependency list (TypeList, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, TypeDescription, RecordComponentDescription, CachedReturnPlugin) shows coupling to multiple distinct concerns. The cohesion metric lcom = -1.0 (indicating undefined/poor cohesion in the provided data) further supports insufficient modularization. Overall these elements justify that the class should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
