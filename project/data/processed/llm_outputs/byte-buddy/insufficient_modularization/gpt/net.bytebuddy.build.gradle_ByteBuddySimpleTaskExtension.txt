    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=42, NOM=7, WMC=7. LCOM=0.4286 indicates reasonable cohesion. It has only 1 field (NOF=1, NOPF=0) and low public surface (NOPM=3). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its low size, low complexity and good cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
