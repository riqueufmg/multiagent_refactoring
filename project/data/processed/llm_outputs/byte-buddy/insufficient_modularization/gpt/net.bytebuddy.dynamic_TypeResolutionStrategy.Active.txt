    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy.Active",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: modest size (loc=69), very low complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0) and only three fields (nof=3) implying limited responsibilities, shallow inheritance (dit=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). These elements suggest the class is already small and focused, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
