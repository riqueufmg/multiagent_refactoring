    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=51, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, number of fields (nof)=2. Low coupling and interaction: fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies limited. Inheritance depth (dit)=0 and cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) do not indicate high internal complexity. These metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization (no evidence of a large, complex class that needs further decomposition)."
