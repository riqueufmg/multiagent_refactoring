    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Engine",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: extremely large size (loc = 3681) and a very high number of fields (nof = 96) indicate it contains substantial state and implementation that can be split; it depends on many distinct components (listed dependencies include at least 12 external types such as net.bytebuddy.build.EntryPoint, net.bytebuddy.utility.StreamDrainer, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodNameTransformer, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool), suggesting multiple responsibilities or roles; given these metrics and dependency breadth, further decomposition into smaller, focused classes would likely reduce size and complexity and improve modularity."
