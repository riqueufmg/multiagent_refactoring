    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LOC is high (144) while the class reports no methods (nom=0) and very few fields (nof=2), indicating a large block of code not decomposed into smaller methods or helper classes. Low coupling to others (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies (ClassFileLocator, Plugin) mean internal decomposition is feasible without increasing external coupling. The cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) and minimal inheritance depth (dit=1) further suggest the class is not well modularized and could be split to reduce size and implementation complexity."
