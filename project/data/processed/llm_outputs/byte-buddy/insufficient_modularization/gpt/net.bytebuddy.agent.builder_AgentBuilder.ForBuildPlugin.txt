    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=22, NOM=0, NOPM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no implemented methods or measurable complexity (LCOM=-1.0). Given the minimal size, lack of methods, and low coupling/dependency usage, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
