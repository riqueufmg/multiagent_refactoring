    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: extremely high number of fields (nof = 263) concentrated in a single class, moderate size (loc = 276) with relatively high cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc = 42). It exposes few methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) while carrying a very large state, indicating multiple responsibilities or aggregated state that could be split. Although LCOM = 0.0 suggests internal cohesion, the sheer amount of fields and concentrated complexity imply the class is a candidate for decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. Additionally, isolated coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) means decomposition can likely be done without creating heavy external dependencies."
