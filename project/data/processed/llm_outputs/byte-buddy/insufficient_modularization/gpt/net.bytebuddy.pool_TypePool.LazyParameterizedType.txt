    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC = 79 (moderate), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no behavioral complexity or many methods), DIT = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0 (low coupling), dependencies limited to 3 types. Although there are 6 fields, the absence of methods and overall low complexity/coupling imply no evidence of insufficient modularization."
