    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=41, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods / zero weighted methods), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), and lcom=-1.0 (no meaningful cohesion data). These metrics indicate there is no internal size or implementation complexity that warrants further decomposition."
