    "justification": "Metrics show no signs of excessive size or complexity: LOC=22, number of fields=0, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. LCOM is not indicative (-1.0). In isolation, the class is small and simple, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
