    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=48, WMC=0, number of methods=0, number of fields=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are few. There is no evidence of high implementation complexity or large size that would warrant further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
