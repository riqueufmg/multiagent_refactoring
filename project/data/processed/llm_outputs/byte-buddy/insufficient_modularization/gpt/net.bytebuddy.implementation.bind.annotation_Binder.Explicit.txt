    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and already minimal: LOC=25, number of fields=1, number of methods=0 (nom=0) and weighted method count=0 (wmc=0), indicating no internal method complexity to decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=0). Given these metrics, there is no evidence of a large, complex class that would benefit from further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
