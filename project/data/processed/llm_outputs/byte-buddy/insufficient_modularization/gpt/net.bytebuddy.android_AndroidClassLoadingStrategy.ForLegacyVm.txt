    "justification": "Class analyzed in isolation has low size and complexity: loc=27, wmc=0, nom=0 (no methods), nof=2 (few fields), nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. These metrics indicate the class is small and lacks internal implementation complexity or a large number of responsibilities that would justify further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
