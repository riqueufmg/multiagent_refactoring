    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size (loc=504) combined with a high number of fields (nof=24) indicates the class holds many responsibilities and state. The class references multiple distinct domain types (AnnotationValue, ParameterDescription, ParameterList, TypeList, MethodDescription, TypeDescription), suggesting it handles varied concerns (annotations, parameters, types, method description). The absence of clearly decomposed behavior (nom=0, wmc=0) and an unclear cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) support that functionality is not modularized into smaller classes or methods. Together these factors point to Insufficient Modularization and that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
