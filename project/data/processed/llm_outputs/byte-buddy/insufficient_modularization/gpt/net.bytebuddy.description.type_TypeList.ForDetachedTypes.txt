    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc=205) and a high number of fields (nof=10) while reporting no methods (nom=0), suggesting a monolithic data/implementation block that has not been decomposed. The presence of multiple dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeVariableToken, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) indicates it interacts with several concepts, increasing the likelihood of mixed responsibilities. These factors (high LOC, many fields, no methods, multiple dependencies) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
