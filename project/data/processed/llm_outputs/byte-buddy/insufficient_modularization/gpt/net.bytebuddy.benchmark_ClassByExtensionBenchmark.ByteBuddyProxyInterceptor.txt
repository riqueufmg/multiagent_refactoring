    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, simple class: LOC=20, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0), and zero complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. These values indicate the class is not large or complex and therefore does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. (LCOM=-1.0 provides no contrary evidence.)"
