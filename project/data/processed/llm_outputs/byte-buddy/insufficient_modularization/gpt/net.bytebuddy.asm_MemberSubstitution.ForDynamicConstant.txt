    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForDynamicConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 138) while containing many fields (nof = 16) but no methods (nom = 0), indicating a large data/state footprint that is not behaviorally decomposed. High LOC combined with many fields suggests multiple responsibilities or internal concepts that could be split. The class depends on multiple distinct types (ParameterDescription, JavaConstant, MethodDescription, Assigner, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, AnnotationDescription), implying interaction with several concerns. These factors point to insufficient modularization and a candidate for further decomposition."
