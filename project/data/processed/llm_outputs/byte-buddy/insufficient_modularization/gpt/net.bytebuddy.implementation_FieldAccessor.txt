    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 1020) and many fields (nof = 21) indicate a high implementation surface that could be split. It contains multiple distinct nested/related types (seen in dependencies: OfReferenceValue, ForBeanProperty, Prepared, TerminationHandler, FieldLocation, AssignerConfigurable, OwnerTypeLocatable, FieldNameExtractor, ForSetter) suggesting multiple responsibilities bundled into one unit. Cohesion metric is low/near-poor (lcom = 0.875), supporting that members are not tightly focused. The class also depends on many concepts (Implementation, FieldDescription, Assigner, FieldLocator, StackManipulation, ConstantValue, TypeDescription), which points to several separate concerns. Taken in isolation, these factors justify refactoring into smaller, more focused classes/modules."
