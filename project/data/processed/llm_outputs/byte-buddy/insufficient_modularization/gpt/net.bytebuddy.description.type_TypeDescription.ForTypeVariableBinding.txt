    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC=91 (moderate size), NOF=3 (few fields), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods/low complexity), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling pressure). Dependencies are limited. Given the small number of members and very low complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
