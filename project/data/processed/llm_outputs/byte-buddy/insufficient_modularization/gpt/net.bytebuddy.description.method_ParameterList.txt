    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization because its implementation size is large (loc = 505) while it exposes very few methods (nom = 4) and holds a relatively large number of fields (nof = 19). A high LOC combined with a low method count implies long, coarse-grained methods that can likely be split into smaller responsibilities. The class also has many external dependencies (10 listed), which suggests it is handling multiple concerns and/or coordinating diverse functionality that could be delegated to smaller classes. Relevant metrics: loc=505, nom=4, nof=19, dependencies=10, wmc=4, dit=1. These elements together justify recommending further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
