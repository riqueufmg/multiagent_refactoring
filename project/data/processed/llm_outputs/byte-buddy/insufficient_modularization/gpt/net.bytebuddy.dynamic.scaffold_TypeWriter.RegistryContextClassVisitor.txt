    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.RegistryContextClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=24), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), a single field (nof=1), no inheritance depth (dit=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
