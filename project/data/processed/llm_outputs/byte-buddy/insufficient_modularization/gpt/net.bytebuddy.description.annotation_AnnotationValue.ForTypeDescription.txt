    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 135) while exposing very few structural elements (nof = 4, nom = 0). This size-to-structure imbalance suggests the class contains a substantial implementation that is not decomposed into smaller responsibilities. It also depends on multiple distinct types (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription), indicating it spans multiple concerns. The combination of high LOC, minimal method/field breakdown, and multi-type dependencies justifies flagging Insufficient Modularization."
