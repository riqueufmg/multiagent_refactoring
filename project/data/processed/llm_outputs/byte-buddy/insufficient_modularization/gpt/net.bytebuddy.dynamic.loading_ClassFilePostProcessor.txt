    "justification": "Single method (nom=1) while file is relatively large (loc=81) indicates behavior concentrated in one routine; four fields (nof=4) accessed by only one method suggests multiple responsibilities are handled inside that single method; low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=1) and zero external interactions (fanin=0, fanout=0) show functionality is internalized rather than modularized; minimal dependencies (one listed) further implies work is implemented inside the class instead of delegated. These factors together point to Insufficient Modularization."
