    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForStackManipulation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High class size (loc = 259) combined with a large number of fields (nof = 13) indicates substantial internal complexity and state. Fanout = 0 suggests the class does not delegate responsibilities to other classes and therefore likely contains multiple responsibilities internally. The listed dependencies span multiple concerns (constant handling, parameter and method descriptions, type and annotation descriptions, assigner and stack manipulation APIs), implying the class mixes responsibilities for constants, metadata and bytecode stack operations rather than delegating them. Together these metrics and dependencies point to Insufficient Modularization: the class appears large, stateful, and responsible for multiple concerns that could be decomposed into smaller modules."
