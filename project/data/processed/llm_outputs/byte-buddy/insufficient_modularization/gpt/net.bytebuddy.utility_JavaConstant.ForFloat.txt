    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=11, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), cyclomatic/complexity WMC=0, low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one listed dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). These metrics show no evidence of an incompletely decomposed class or excessive size/complexity that would indicate Insufficient Modularization."
