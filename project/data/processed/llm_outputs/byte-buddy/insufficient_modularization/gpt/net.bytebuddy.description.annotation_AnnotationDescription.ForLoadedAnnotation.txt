    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it contains a large amount of code (loc = 192) while exposing very few internal decomposition points (nom = 0 methods, nof = 3 fields). At the same time it depends on many distinct concepts (dependencies include AnnotationValue, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, AnnotationDescription, EnumerationDescription, AccessControllerPlugin), indicating multiple responsibilities. The combination of high LOC with near-zero method count and multiple external dependencies suggests behavior and complexity are concentrated in a single class rather than being decomposed into smaller, focused modules."
