    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: an extremely large number of fields (nof = 263) concentrated in a single class together with sizable size (loc = 276) and elevated complexity (wmc = 42). It has relatively few methods (nom = 9, nopm = 8) to operate on a very large state space, suggesting multiple responsibilities and data bundled into one unit. The class is self-contained (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dependencies limited) and not decomposed into collaborators (nc = 0), indicating opportunity to split the large field set and logic into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
