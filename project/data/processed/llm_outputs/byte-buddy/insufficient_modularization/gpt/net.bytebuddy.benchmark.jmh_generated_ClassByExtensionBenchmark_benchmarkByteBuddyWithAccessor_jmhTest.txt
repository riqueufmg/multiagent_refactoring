    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: extremely high number of fields (nof=263) while having few methods (nom=9, nopm=8) — about 29 fields per method — which indicates the class holds excessive state and likely multiple responsibilities. Size and complexity are also elevated (loc=276, wmc=42), suggesting implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposition. Although LCOM=0.0 indicates method cohesion, the disproportionate field count and overall complexity justify refactoring into smaller, more focused classes or components."
