    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Preprocessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and carrying multiple responsibilities: it has 211 lines of code (loc = 211) and 11 fields (nof = 11), which indicates substantial internal content that could be split. The dependency list references seven external types (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool), suggesting interaction with multiple concerns. Cohesion/metric values are not informative (lcom = -1.0, wmc = 0, nom = 0), which combined with the large size and number of fields points to an incomplete decomposition; further modularization (splitting responsibilities into smaller classes/components) is likely warranted."
