    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.PostProcessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc = 115) while exposing very few structural elements (nof = 2 fields, nom = 0 methods). Such size concentrated without a clear decomposition suggests it likely contains multiple responsibilities or dense implementation that could be split. Its dependencies on net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation and net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin indicate it touches distinct concerns (bytecode manipulation and equality/hashcode support), reinforcing that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
