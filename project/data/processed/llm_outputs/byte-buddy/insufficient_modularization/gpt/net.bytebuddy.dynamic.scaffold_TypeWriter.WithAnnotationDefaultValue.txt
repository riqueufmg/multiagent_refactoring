    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithAnnotationDefaultValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: it has no methods (nom = 0) and zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 0), only three fields (nof = 3) and a modest size (loc = 81). Coupling indicators are low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics do not indicate a large, complex, or poorly decomposed class that would benefit from further decomposition."
