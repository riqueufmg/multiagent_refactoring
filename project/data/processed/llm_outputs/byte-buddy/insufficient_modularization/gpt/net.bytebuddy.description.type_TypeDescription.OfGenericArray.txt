    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.OfGenericArray",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it has a relatively large size (loc = 237) while collaborating with many external types (11 dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, RecordComponentList, FieldDescription, MethodDescription, CachedReturnPlugin, TypeDescription, MethodList, RecordComponentDescription, StackSize, AnnotationSource, FieldList), suggesting multiple responsibilities and coupling to diverse concerns. It declares state (nof = 4) but shows no method decomposition in the provided metrics (nom = 0) and an atypical cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0), indicating poor or unclear internal decomposition. These elements together point to a class that would likely benefit from further decomposition to reduce size, separate responsibilities, and improve modularity."
