    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed, highly complex class. Although LOC is 168, the class reports 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 weighted method complexity (wmc=0), indicating no large method bodies to decompose. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, so there is no evidence of high coupling driving a need to split responsibilities. There are 7 fields (nof=7), but without accompanying method complexity or cohesion data (lcom reported as -1.0/unknown) this alone is insufficient to conclude Insufficient Modularization."
