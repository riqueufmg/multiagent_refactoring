    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForLoadedExecutableExceptionType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not underspecified for modularization: LOC=44, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method complexity (wmc)=0, number of fields (nof)=3. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no methods to split further. These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
