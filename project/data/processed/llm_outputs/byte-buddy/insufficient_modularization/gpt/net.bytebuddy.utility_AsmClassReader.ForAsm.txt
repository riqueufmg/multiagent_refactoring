    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=53, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0. It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (dit=1). These metrics show the class is simple and self-contained, providing no evidence that it has not been sufficiently decomposed."
