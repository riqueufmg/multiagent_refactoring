    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.AbstractDelegator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: loc = 202 (large implementation size) while decomposition metrics are absent/zero (nom = 0, nof = 0, nopf = 0, nopm = 0), suggesting the implementation is not decomposed into smaller methods/fields. Cohesion indicator lcom = -1.0 is not positive, and complexity/interaction metrics are minimal (wmc = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0) which together with the large LOC implies a monolithic class that would benefit from further decomposition. DIT = 1 and the presence of multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator) further support that the class likely mixes responsibilities and should be modularized."
