    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and contains no behavior to decompose: LOC=28, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. Low coupling and usage: FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, single dependency listed. Given the lack of methods and negligible complexity, there is no evidence of an incompletely decomposed class requiring further modularization."
