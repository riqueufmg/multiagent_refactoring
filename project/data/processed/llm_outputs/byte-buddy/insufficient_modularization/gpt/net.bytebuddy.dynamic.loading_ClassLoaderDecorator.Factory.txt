    "justification": "Class has small size and no internal complexity to decompose: LOC=25, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no methods/operations indicate there is nothing to further split. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
