    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: it has only 1 method (nom=1) and very low complexity (wmc=1), only 2 fields (nof=2), zero incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and strong cohesion (lcom=-1.0). While its LOC is 182, the minimal method count and low complexity indicate the class is not an undecomposed, large-responsibility unit that would benefit from further decomposition."
