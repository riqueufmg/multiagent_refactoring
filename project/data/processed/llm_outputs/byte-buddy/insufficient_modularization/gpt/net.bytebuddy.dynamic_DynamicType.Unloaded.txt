    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Unloaded",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: class is small and simple (loc=51), contains only one field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0), has no measured complexity (wmc=0), and shows no coupling pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no actionable cohesion problem in the provided data. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that it would benefit from additional modularization."
