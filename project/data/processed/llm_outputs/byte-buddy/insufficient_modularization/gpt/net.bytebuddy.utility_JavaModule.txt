    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is relatively large (LOC = 238) with many operations (NOM = 19) and a large public API surface (NOPM = 17), and non-trivial implementation complexity (WMC = 22). It depends on a wide range of concepts (AnnotationList, JavaDispatcher, ModuleDescription, NamedElement, ClassFileVersion, AccessControllerPlugin, PackageDescription, plus JavaModule.Resolver and JavaModule.Module), suggesting multiple responsibilities are handled in a single class. Although LCOM = 0.2105 indicates some cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high number of public methods, and elevated WMC supports that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
