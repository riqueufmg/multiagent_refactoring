    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForExplicitField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Analyzed in isolation, the class is small and simple: LOC=68, number of fields (nof)=3, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method count (wmc)=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There is no evidence of high implementation complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition. The few external dependencies do not, by themselves, indicate an undecomposed class. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
