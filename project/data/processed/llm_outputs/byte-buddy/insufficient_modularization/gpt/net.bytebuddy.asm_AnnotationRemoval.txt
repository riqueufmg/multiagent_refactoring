    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AnnotationRemoval",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class exhibits characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: large size (loc = 379), many fields (nof = 21) and methods (nom = 17, nopm = 16 public), and non-trivial complexity (wmc = 22). The combination of high LOC and large number of fields/methods indicates the class likely holds multiple responsibilities or substantial state that could be split to reduce size and implementation complexity. Although lcom = 0.0 indicates cohesion, the sheer volume of code and members (plus multiple external dependencies) justify refactoring into smaller, focused classes or components."
