    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: loc=20, nom=2, nopm=2 and low complexity wmc=2. Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies only include Implementation). Inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1) and there are no children (nc=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and cohesive, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
