    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin.WithNonNullableFields",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and non-complex (LOC=24, WMC=0), has no fields or methods to decompose (NOF=0, NOM=0), shows high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), and has no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
