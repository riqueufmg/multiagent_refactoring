    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=28, NOM=0, WMC=0. Coupling and interaction are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric is not indicating fragmentation (LCOM=-1.0). Although there are listed dependencies, the provided metrics show no internal method/complexity burden or high coupling that would justify further decomposition, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
