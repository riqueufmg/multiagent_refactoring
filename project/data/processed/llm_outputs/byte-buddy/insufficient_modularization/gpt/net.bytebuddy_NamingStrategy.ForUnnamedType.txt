    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity (loc=14, wmc=0), no methods or fields recorded (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and LCOM is not meaningful (-1.0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and there is no evidence it should be further decomposed."
