    "justification": "Class appears small and simple: LOC=46, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=3. Coupling and usage metrics are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0), inheritance depth is 0 (DIT=0). There are no methods (NOM=0) and low number of fields, so there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization. Dependencies are limited and do not imply internal decomposition needs."
