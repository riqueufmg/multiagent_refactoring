    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undivided or overly large class: loc=82 (moderate size), wmc=0 (no measured complexity), nom=0 and nopf=0 (no or negligible method/parameter counts), nof=3 (few fields). LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. fanin=0 and fanout=0 show low coupling. Although there are several external type dependencies, the internal size and complexity metrics provide no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
