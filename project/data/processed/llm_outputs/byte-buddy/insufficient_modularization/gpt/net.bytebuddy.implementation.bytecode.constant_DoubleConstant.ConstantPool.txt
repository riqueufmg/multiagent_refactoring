    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC = 23, number of fields = 1, number of methods = 0, WMC = 0. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and minimal external dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and complexity and do not suggest an undecomposed responsibility that would benefit from further modularization."
