    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=17, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, single dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and LCOM=-1.0. There are no methods or fields and very low complexity/coupling, so there is no evidence this class has not been sufficiently decomposed or would benefit from further modularization."
