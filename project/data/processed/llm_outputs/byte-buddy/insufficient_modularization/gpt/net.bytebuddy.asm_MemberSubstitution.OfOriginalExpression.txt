    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC is moderate (76) but complexity metrics are zero or absent (WMC=0, nom=0, nof=0), cohesion metric is unavailable/neutral (LCOM=-1.0), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although the class lists several external type dependencies, there is no evidence in the provided per-class metrics of multiple responsibilities, high implementation complexity, or internal size that would justify marking it as Insufficient Modularization when considered in isolation."
