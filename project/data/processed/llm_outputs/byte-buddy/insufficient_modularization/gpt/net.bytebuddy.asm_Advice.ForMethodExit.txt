    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large size (loc = 125) while exposing very few structural elements (nof = 2 fields, nom = 0 methods), which indicates substantial implementation content not decomposed into smaller methods or helper classes. Additionally, it depends on multiple distinct types (Implementation, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, TypeDefinition, StackSize), suggesting it touches several responsibilities. The combination of high LOC and low method count (and minimal modular boundaries) supports detection of Insufficient Modularization."
