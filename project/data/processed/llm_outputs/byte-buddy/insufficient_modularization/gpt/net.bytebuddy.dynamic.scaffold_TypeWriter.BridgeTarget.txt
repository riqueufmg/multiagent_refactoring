    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.BridgeTarget",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a non-trivial size (loc = 76) while declaring no methods (nom = 0) and only two fields (nof = 2), indicating substantial implementation content that is not organized into separate methods or smaller collaborators. It depends on multiple distinct types (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription), which suggests multiple responsibilities. The mismatch between size (loc) and method/field counts (nom, nof) supports that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity, so insufficient modularization is detected."
