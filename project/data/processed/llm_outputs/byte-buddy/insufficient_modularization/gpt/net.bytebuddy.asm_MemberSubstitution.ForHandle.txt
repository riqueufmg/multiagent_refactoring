    "justification": "Metrics do not provide evidence of an undecomposed, multi-responsibility class: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted method count (wmc) = 0 indicate no method-level complexity to split; LCOM = -1.0 (not meaningful) so cohesion cannot be shown low; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show no coupling that would suggest multiple responsibilities. Although loc = 102 and nof = 10 (10 fields) indicate some size, the absence of methods/complexity metrics and the invalid cohesion metric mean there is insufficient evidence, from these metrics and dependencies, to conclude Insufficient Modularization."
