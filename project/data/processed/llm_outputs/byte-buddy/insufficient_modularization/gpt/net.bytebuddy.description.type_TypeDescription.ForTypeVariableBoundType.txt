    "justification": "LOC=99 indicates moderate size, but NOM=0 and NOPM=0 show no methods/public methods and WMC=0 shows no implementation complexity to decompose. FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 and only two listed dependencies indicate very low coupling. NOF=5 (fields) with no behavioral complexity suggests the class primarily holds data/metadata rather than a large undivided implementation. Given the absence of methods/complexity and low coupling, there is insufficient evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
