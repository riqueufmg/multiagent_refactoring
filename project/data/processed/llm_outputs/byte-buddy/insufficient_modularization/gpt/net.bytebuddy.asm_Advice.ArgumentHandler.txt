    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ArgumentHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class is very large (loc = 418) while showing no internal decomposition into methods (nom = 0) and a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 11). A single class with high LOC and many fields but no reported methods indicates the implementation is monolithic and likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be split. The presence of several external dependencies (StackSize, TypeDefinition, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, MethodDescription) further suggests the class coordinates multiple concerns. Together these metrics justify insufficient modularization."
