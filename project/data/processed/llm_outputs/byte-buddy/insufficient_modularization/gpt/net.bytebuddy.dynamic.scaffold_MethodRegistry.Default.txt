    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is large (loc = 502) and holds many fields (nof = 29), which typically indicates multiple responsibilities bundled into one class. Its dependency list is extensive (e.g. net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer), suggesting diverse collaboration and likely mixed concerns. The combination of high LOC, many fields, and numerous external dependencies justifies flagging this class as insufficiently modular and a candidate for decomposition into smaller, focused classes."
