    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that is large or complex enough to require further decomposition: LOC = 54 (small), WMC = 0 and NOM = 0 (no behavioral complexity or methods to decompose), DIT = 1 (shallow inheritance), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling pressures), NOPF = 0 and cohesion metric LCOM = -1.0 (no sign of poor cohesion). The class has a small number of fields (NOF = 4) but no methods, suggesting a simple holder/adapter rather than a class that needs modular decomposition."
