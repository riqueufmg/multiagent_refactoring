    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.PackageDiscriminating",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=32, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, fanout=0, fanin=0. It defines no methods (nom=0) and has no measurable complexity (wmc=0), indicating there is no internal implementation to decompose further. Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation (only two dependencies listed), there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
