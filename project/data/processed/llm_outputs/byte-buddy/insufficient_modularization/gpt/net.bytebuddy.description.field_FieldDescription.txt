    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large body (loc: 509) while exposing relatively few methods (nom: 4) which suggests long methods or substantial internal code that could be split; a relatively high number of fields (nof: 16) indicating multiple responsibilities or state that might be decomposed; presence of nested/related types in its dependency list (FieldDescription.SignatureToken, FieldDescription.InDefinedShape) indicates some internal complexity already grouped inside the same class rather than in separate top-level types; low WMC (4) combined with high LOC implies the size is due to amount of code/structure rather than method complexity, consistent with a class that was not fully decomposed. Fanin/fanout are 0 (low coupling externally) and LCOM is -1.0 (metric unclear), but these do not outweigh the large LOC and many fields that justify further decomposition."
