    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, large, or complex class. LOC is small (51), number of methods (nom) = 0 and WMC = 0, indicating no internal behavioral complexity to decompose. Number of fields (nof) = 2 is minimal, and coupling indicators are low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). LCOM is not showing cohesion issues. Given these values, there is no evidence this class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
