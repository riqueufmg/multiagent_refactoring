    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive, so further decomposition is not indicated. Metrics: loc=26, nom=3, wmc=3, nof=1, nopm=2, lcom=0.0. Low LOC and low WMC show low implementation complexity; small number of methods and fields and LCOM=0.0 indicate high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and fan-out=0 show it has no coupling pressure in the provided isolation. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
