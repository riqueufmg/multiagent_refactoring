    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc = 111) combined with a relatively high number of fields (nof = 7) but no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0) suggests it primarily accumulates state/responsibilities rather than encapsulating behavior. The presence of multiple external dependencies (ParameterDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, AnnotationDescription, Assigner, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) indicates the class touches several concerns. The cohesion metric is unavailable/negative (lcom = -1.0), which does not refute low cohesion. These elements together justify that the class likely should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
