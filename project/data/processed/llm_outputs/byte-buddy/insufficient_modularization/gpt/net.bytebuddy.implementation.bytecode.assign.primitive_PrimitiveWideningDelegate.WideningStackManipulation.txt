    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=29, WMC=0 (no implementation complexity), NOM=0 (no methods to split), NOF=2 (only two fields), FANOUT=0 and FANIN=0 (no coupling indicating multiple responsibilities). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate fragmented cohesion. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
