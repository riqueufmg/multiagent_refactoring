    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of being insufficiently modularized: it is small (loc=42), has no methods (nom=0) and no cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), no coupling measured (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no reported non-comment metrics (nc=0). These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
