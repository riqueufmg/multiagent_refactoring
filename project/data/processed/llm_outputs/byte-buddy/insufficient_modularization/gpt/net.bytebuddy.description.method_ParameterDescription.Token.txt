    "justification": "Size and state concentration: loc=148 and nof=7 indicate a relatively large class with many fields. Multiple distinct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin) point to several responsibilities being handled. Low method metrics (nom=0, wmc=0) suggest the class bundles substantial state and possibly mixed concerns rather than well-separated behavior. These elements together justify that the class has insufficient modularization and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
