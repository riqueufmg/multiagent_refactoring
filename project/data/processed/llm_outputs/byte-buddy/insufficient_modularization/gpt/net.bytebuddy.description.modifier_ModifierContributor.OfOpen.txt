    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=9, single field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition."
