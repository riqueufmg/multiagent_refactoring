    "justification": "Class has very low size and complexity (loc=14, wmc=0), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although it declares 12 fields (nof=12), the absence of behavior and the minimal LOC/WMC indicate it is not a large or complex class that requires further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
