    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show Insufficient Modularization: it has a small interface (nom=2 methods, nof=2 fields), low complexity (wmc=2), and modest size (loc=100). Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0) and coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=0). Given these metrics and the limited number of dependencies, there is no evidence that the class is too large or insufficiently decomposed."
