    "justification": "Class not flagged for Insufficient Modularization: very small size (LOC=17), no methods (NOM=0) and no fields (NOF=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 (not indicating low cohesion for decomposition). No metric suggests the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
