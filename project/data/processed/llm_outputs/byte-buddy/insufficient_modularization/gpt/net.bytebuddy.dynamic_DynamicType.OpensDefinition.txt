    "justification": "The class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc = 30), no fields (nof = 0) and no methods (nom = 0 / nopm = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). The cohesion metric is not available (lcom = -1.0) but all other metrics indicate a trivial/small class that does not require further decomposition."
