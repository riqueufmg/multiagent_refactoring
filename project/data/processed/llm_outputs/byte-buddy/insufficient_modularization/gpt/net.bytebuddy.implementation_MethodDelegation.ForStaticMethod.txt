    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: loc=41 (small size), nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods to decompose), nof=1 (single field), wmc=0 (no internal complexity), lcom=-1.0 (no sign of low cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling pressure). Dependencies are limited. Based on these elements taken in isolation, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
