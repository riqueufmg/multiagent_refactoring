    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: number of fields (nof=3) is small, number of methods (nom=0) is zero, weighted method count (wmc=0) is zero, and fan-in/fan-out are both 0. LOC is moderate (73) but without methods or measured complexity this does not imply an understuctured class. The cohesion metric is not indicating poor cohesion (lcom=-1.0 as unavailable), and dependency list is limited. Given the class in isolation, there is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or low cohesion that would justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
