    "justification": "The class is small (LOC=26) with no fields (NOF=0) and no methods (NOM=0), very low complexity (WMC=0), zero fan-in/fan-out (0) and no dependencies. LCOM is -1 (cohesion not applicable given no methods). These metrics indicate no internal size or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
