    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: LOC is small (25), WMC=0 and no methods reported (nof=0, nom=0), indicating minimal internal complexity; LCOM is non-applicable (-1.0); fan-in and fan-out are 0, showing no coupling pressure to split; dependencies are limited to two types. These elements show the class is small and simple, so further decomposition is not warranted."
