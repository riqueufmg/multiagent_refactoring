    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=49, no methods (nom=0), WMC=0. It shows low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and minimal field count (nof=1). These metrics indicate the class is not large or complex enough to require further decomposition; therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
