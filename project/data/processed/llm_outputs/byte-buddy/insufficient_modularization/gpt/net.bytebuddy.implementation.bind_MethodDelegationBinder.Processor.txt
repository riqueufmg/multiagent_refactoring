    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Processor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=44), has no methods (nom=0) and zero measured complexity (wmc=0), indicating no large implementation to decompose. Cohesion metric lcom=-1.0 and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) further show the class is simple and self-contained. Dependencies are minimal. These elements indicate no need for further decomposition."
