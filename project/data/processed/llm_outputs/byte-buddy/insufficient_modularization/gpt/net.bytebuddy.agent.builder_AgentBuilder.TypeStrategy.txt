    "justification": "LOC = 87 (non-trivial size) combined with 6 external dependencies indicates notable coupling; nom = 0 and nof = 1 show little surface API while implementation size is moderate, suggesting responsibilities or logic are concentrated inside the single class. These elements (LOC and dependency count together with lack of methods) justify that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
