    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: very small size (LOC=11), no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (WMC=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Depth of inheritance (DIT=2) and reported LCOM are not indicative of a large, undecomposed class. Given these values, there is no evidence the class needs further decomposition."
