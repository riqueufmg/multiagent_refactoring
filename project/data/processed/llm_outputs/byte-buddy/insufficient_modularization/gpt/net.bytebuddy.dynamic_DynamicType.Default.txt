    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 155) while exposing multiple fields (nof = 6), which suggests it holds several responsibilities; it also lists multiple external collaborators (dependencies: LoadedTypeInitializer, TypeResolutionStrategy, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, DynamicType, ClassLoadingStrategy, InjectionClassLoader), indicating coordination of diverse concerns. Although method/complexity metrics (nom = 0, wmc = 0) are low or not informative, the combination of file size and breadth of dependencies is consistent with a class that could be further decomposed to reduce size and separate concerns, so Insufficient Modularization is detected."
