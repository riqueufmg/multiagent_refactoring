The top-level class aggregates diverse responsibilities (descriptor handling, runtime-loaded module adaptation, metadata and nested element types) and depends on many external utilities, indicating a concentration of responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition."

Its size and external responsibilities suggest it handles both reflective/runtime concerns and module description logic, making it a candidate for splitting runtime adaptation logic from pure description concerns."
