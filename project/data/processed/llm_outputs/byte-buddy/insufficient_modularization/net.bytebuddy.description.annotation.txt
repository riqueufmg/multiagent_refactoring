It has numerous dependencies and mixes representation, loading, invocation handler and builder functionality, suggesting a bloated interface and multiple responsibilities that could be modularized."

It leverages list/filter abstractions (FilterableList, TypeList) and contains only a few small inner variants (Explicit, ForLoadedAnnotations, Empty, AbstractBase) consistent with a cohesive collection abstraction rather than a single overly-bloated class."
