The class/file aggregates multiple distinct constant kinds, visitors and dispatchers, indicating multiple responsibilities and a bloated abstraction that would benefit from decomposition into cohesive, smaller abstractions."

Its purpose appears focused (string/random generation) with no evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
