The class encloses many distinct nested types and responsibilities (MethodLocator, ArgumentLoader/ArgumentProvider, TargetHandler, MethodInvoker, multiple 'For*' variants and factory/appenders), indicating aggregation of method resolution, argument provision, target handling and bytecode emission. The diversity of responsibilities and volume of code suggest the abstraction is not adequately decomposed into cohesive, smaller modules."

It has few nested types and limited, directly related dependencies (termination handler, appender, bytecode related interfaces), indicating a single, cohesive responsibility (representing a super method invocation) and therefore does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
