    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Removal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5 total, 4 public), low complexity (WMC=8), and reasonable size (64 LOC). The LCOM value of 0.8 indicates good cohesion within the class. With only 2 fields and no inheritance (DIT=1), the class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
