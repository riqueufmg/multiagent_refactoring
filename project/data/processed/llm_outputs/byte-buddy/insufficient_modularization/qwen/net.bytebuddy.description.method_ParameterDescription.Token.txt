{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 148 lines of code (loc=148), with no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate that the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit complexity that would require further modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or token class with minimal implementation complexity."
