    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyUnboundWildcard",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=46 but this appears to be the file level, not class level), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The class also has minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3). Based on the metrics, this class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
