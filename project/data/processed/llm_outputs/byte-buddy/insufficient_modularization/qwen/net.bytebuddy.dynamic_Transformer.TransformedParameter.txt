    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 78 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no public methods (nopm=0, nopf=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or parameter object with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
