    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and only 28 lines of code (loc=28). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no method complexity, the class is already sufficiently decomposed for its current functionality."
