    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 26 lines of code (loc=26), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class-level dependencies (nc=0, dit=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
