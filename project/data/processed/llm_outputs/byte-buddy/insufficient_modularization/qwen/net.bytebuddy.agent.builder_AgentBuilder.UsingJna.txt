    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 18 lines of code (loc=18) and zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0). The lack of methods and low size indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No other complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) suggest the need for additional modularization."
