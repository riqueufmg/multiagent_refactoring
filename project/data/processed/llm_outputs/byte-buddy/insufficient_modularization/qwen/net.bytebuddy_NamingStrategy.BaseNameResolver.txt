    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is likely an abstract base class or interface. With minimal implementation complexity and no concrete functionality, there is insufficient evidence of incomplete decomposition. The low LOC count (46) reflects its role as a base class rather than a complex implementation requiring further modularization."
