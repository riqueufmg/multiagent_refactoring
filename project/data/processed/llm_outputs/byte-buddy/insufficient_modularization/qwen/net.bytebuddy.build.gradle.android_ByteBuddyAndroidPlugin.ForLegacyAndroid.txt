    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.ForLegacyAndroid",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 40 lines of code (loc=40) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it is already sufficiently decomposed. The lack of methods and low size suggest this class does not require further decomposition to reduce size or implementation complexity."
