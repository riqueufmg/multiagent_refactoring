    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_jmhType_B1",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 18 lines of code, 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and a low number of fields (nof=256 but nopf=0). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal complexity. The Depth of Inheritance Tree is 1 (dit=1) and Number of Children is 1 (nc=1), suggesting a simple inheritance structure. The low complexity metrics and minimal method count indicate this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
