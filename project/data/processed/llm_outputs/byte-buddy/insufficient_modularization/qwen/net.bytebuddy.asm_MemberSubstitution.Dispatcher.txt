    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 201 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The high number of fields (nof=9) also suggests the class is managing multiple responsibilities that could be separated into distinct modules."
