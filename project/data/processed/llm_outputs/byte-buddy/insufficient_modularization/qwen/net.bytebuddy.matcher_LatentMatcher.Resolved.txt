    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=23 but this appears to be the enclosing file), WMC=0, and no dependencies flowing out (fanout=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it lacks the complexity that would require further decomposition."
