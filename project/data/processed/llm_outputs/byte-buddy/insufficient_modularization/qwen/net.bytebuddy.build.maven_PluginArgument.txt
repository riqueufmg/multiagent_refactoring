    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.PluginArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 2 fields (nof=2), and 20 lines of code (loc=20). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure indicates it is already well modularized. There is no evidence of insufficient decomposition as the class appears to have appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
