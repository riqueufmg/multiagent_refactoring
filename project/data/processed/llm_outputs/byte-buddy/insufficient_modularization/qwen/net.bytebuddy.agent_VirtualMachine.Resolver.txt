    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.Resolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 19 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 dependencies. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple resolver implementation that is already sufficiently modularized given its limited scope and complexity."
