    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.FieldPool",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields and 187 lines of code. It has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) indicating minimal implementation complexity. The lack of methods and low field count suggests it is already well-decomposed or serves as a simple data structure rather than a complex class requiring further modularization."
