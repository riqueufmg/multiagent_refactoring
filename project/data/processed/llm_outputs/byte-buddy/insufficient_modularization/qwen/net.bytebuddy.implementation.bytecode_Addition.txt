    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Addition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 46 lines of code (loc=46), and weighted method count of 3 (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=2) and low LCOM value (0.667) suggest reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be a simple, well-contained implementation with minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
