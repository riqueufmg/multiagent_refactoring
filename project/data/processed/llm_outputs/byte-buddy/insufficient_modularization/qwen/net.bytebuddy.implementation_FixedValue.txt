{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) with only 5 nested classes (nc=5), indicating potential for further decomposition. The lines of code (loc=486) and weighted method count (wmc=14) suggest high implementation complexity. The lack of fan-in (fanin=0) and fan-out (fanout=0) dependencies indicates isolation, but the internal complexity and method count suggest insufficient modularization."
