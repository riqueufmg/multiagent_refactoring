    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyPlugin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1) and 16 fields (nof=16) with 314 lines of code. While the class has a relatively high number of fields, the low method count and simple structure (wmc=2) indicate it is not overly complex. The class appears to be a plugin configuration class that naturally contains many fields for configuration purposes. The lack of complex dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple method structure suggest it is appropriately modularized for its purpose."
