    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.Visitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 73 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it is already well-decomposed. The lack of methods suggests this may be an interface or abstract class that properly delegates implementation details to subclasses. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized and structured."
