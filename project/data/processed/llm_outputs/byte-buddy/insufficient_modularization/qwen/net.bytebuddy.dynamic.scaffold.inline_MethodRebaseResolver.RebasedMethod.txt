{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodRebaseResolver.RebasedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), and 0 weighted method count (wmc). The lines of code (loc) is 82 which is moderate. With no methods and low complexity metrics, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be a simple data holder or value object rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
