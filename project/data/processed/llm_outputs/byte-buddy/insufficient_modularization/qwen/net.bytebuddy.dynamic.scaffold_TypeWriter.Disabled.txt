    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Disabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=12 but this appears to be file-level), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and 0 dependencies. The metrics indicate a minimal or empty class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it lacks the complexity that would require further decomposition."
