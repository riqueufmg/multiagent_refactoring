    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.NullCheckedConstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=34 but this appears to be the file loc not class loc), and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, lcom=-1.0). With no methods or complexity present, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already at a minimal decomposition state."
