    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.Transformation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 40 lines of code (loc=40), and a low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lack of class dependencies (dit=1, fanin=0, fanout=0) and low LCOM value (lcom=1.0) indicate good cohesion. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
