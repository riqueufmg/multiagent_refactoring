    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.SyntheticState",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. It has only 1 field (nof=1) and 4 public methods (nopm=4), suggesting a cohesive design. The LCOM value of 0.8 indicates good cohesion within the class. The class appears to be well-focused on a single responsibility with appropriate size and complexity, not warranting further decomposition."
