{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Malformed",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0) and only 77 lines of code. It has no methods or fields (NOM=0, NOF=4, NOPF=0), indicating it is already minimally implemented. The low LOC and absence of complex metrics suggest it does not require further decomposition."
