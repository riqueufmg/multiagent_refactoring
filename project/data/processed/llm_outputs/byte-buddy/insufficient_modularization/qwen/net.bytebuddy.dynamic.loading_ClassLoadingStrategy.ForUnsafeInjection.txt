    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), minimal size with 28 lines of code (loc=28), no fields (nof=1), and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low metric values indicate the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit characteristics of insufficient modularization such as high complexity, large size, or excessive responsibilities."
