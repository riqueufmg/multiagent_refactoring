{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.WithCustomMapping",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high Lines of Code (LOC) value of 402, which indicates it is quite large and potentially complex. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods (nom=0), the class appears to have insufficient internal structure and decomposition. The high LOC combined with minimal internal elements suggests the class could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
