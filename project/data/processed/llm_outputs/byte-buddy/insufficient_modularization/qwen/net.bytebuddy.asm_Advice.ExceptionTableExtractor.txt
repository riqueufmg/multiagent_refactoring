    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies on other classes within the provided data. The class appears to be a simple, well-decomposed unit with minimal responsibilities, indicating sufficient modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
