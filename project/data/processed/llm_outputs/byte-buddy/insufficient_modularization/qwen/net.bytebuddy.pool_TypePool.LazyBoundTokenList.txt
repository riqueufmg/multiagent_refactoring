    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 47 lines of code, 4 fields, and 0 methods. The metrics indicate minimal implementation complexity (wmc=0, nom=0) and the class appears to be a simple data structure or lightweight wrapper rather than a complex class that requires further decomposition."
