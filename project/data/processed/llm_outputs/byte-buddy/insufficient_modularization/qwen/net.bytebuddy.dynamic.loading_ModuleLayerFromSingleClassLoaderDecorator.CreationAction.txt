    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 18 lines of code (loc=18). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies on other classes from this class (fanout=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or parameter object with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
