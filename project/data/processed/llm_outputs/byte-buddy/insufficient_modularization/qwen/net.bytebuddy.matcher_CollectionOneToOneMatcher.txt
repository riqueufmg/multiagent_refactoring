    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 46 lines of code (loc=46), and a low weighted method count (wmc=8). The low number of methods and moderate size indicate sufficient modularization. The class appears to be focused on a single responsibility with appropriate decomposition."
