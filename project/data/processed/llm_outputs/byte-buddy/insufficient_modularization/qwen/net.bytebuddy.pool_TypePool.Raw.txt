    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Raw",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 201 lines of code (loc=201). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low number of fields and methods suggests it is already well-decomposed. The class appears to be a data container or simple structure rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. No complex dependencies or high complexity metrics indicate insufficient modularization."
