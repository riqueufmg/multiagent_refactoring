    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.ForDefaultValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 253 lines of code (loc) which is excessively high for a single class, indicating it has not been completely decomposed. The class contains 8 fields (nof) but no methods (nom), suggesting it may be holding too much data responsibility without proper behavioral decomposition. The lack of methods (wmc = 0) combined with significant size indicates insufficient modularization where further decomposition could reduce implementation complexity."
