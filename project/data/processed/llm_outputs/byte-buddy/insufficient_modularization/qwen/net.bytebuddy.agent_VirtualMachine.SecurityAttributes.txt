    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.SecurityAttributes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields and 0 methods, with a very low LOC count of 20. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or configuration class rather than a complex module requiring refactoring."
