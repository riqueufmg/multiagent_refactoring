    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 32 lines of code (loc=32), and no fields (nof=0). The low number of methods and lines of code indicate that the class is already sufficiently modularized. There is no evidence of high complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
