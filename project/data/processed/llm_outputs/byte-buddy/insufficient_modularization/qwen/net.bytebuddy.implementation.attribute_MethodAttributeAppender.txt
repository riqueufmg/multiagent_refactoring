{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high lines of code (338 LOC) with only 1 method (NOM=1), indicating insufficient decomposition. The high nesting complexity (NC=8) and presence of multiple dependencies (8 dependencies listed) suggest that this class handles too much responsibility and could benefit from further modularization into smaller, more focused classes."
