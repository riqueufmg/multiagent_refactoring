    "justification": "The class has 236 lines of code but lacks sufficient metric data (WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0) to determine if it exceeds complexity thresholds. No dependencies are present, but without clear evidence of high complexity or size that would indicate insufficient modularization, detection cannot be confirmed."
