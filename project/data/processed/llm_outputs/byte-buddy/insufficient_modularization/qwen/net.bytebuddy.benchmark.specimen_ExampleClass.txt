```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.specimen.ExampleClass",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18, nopm=18) and 167 lines of code (loc=167), indicating high implementation complexity and size. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests poor decomposition where functionality could be better distributed into smaller, more focused classes. The high method count relative to the lack of fields indicates the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that should be separated."
