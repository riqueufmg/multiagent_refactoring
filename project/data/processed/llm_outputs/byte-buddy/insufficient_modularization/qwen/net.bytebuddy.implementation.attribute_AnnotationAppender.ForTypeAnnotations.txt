    "justification": "The class has 12 fields (nof=12) and 250 lines of code (loc=250), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential issues with decomposition, and the high field count suggests insufficient modularization where further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
