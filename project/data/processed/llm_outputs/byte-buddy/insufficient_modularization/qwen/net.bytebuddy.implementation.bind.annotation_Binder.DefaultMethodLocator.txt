    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.DefaultMethodLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0), and only 50 lines of code. The low number of methods and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition is not necessary as the class is already sufficiently simple and modular."
