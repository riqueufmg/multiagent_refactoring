```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin.PrefixingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 63 lines of code (loc=63). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low complexity indicates it is already well-decomposed. While it has dependencies on 5 external classes, this is typical for a visitor pattern implementation and does not indicate insufficient modularization given the class's limited responsibilities."
