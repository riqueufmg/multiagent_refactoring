    "justification": "The class has 11 fields (nof=11) and 208 lines of code (loc=208), which indicates a moderate size. However, it has 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), suggesting it may be a data-only class or incomplete implementation. Without sufficient method complexity or behavioral indicators, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
