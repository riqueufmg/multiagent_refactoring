    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.MethodConstant.CachedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 0 public methods (nopm=0). The lines of code (loc=45) are relatively small, weighted method count (wmc=0) indicates no complex methods, and depth of inheritance (dit=1) shows no deep inheritance hierarchy. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low field count suggest this is likely a simple data holder or value object rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
