    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 34 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond TypeList. The class appears to be a simple data structure or list implementation that is already sufficiently modularized for its purpose."
