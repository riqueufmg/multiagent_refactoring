    "justification": "The class has low complexity with WMC=1, only 1 method (NOM=1), 2 fields (NOF=2), and 182 lines of code. The LCOM value is -1.0 which indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple interface or abstract class with minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
