    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Preprocessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 fields (nof=11) and 211 lines of code (loc=211), but lacks method count data (nom=0, wmc=0) necessary to assess implementation complexity. Without information about the number of methods or their complexity, insufficient modularization cannot be reliably detected. The class appears to be a nested class (Preprocessor) which may have a focused responsibility."
