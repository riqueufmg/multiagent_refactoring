    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 1 field (nof=1), and 26 lines of code (loc=26). The Weighted Method Count (wmc=3) indicates low complexity. With only 3 dependencies and no inheritance (dit=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
