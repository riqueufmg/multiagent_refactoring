{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.OfReferenceValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 64 lines of code (loc=64). While the class has some complexity indicated by dependencies on 5 other classes, the low number of fields and methods suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0) indicates this may be a data-only class or configuration holder, which is acceptable for modularization purposes."
