    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AbstractReadOnlyAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 17 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0). The metrics indicate minimal implementation complexity and size, suggesting it is already sufficiently decomposed. No further decomposition is warranted given its minimal functionality."
