    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0, nc=0) and only 81 lines of code. With only 3 fields and no methods, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The low complexity and small size indicate proper modularization rather than a need for further decomposition."
