{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 42 lines of code (loc=42) and all metrics indicating minimal size and complexity (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0). The low LOC and absence of methods, fields, and complex metrics suggest the class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
