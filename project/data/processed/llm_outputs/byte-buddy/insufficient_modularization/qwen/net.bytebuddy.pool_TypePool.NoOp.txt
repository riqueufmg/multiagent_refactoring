    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is already minimally decomposed. With only 24 lines of code (loc=24) and no complexity (wmc=0), the class is trivial in size and implementation complexity. There are no dependencies or structural elements that suggest further decomposition would be beneficial. The class appears to be a simple marker or placeholder class that does not require further modularization."
