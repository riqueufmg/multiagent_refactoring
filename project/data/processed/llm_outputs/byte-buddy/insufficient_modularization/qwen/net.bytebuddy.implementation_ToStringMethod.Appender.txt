    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.ToStringMethod.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 fields (nof=6), 0 methods (nom=0), and 84 lines of code (loc=84). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal method complexity. With no methods present and relatively low field count, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
