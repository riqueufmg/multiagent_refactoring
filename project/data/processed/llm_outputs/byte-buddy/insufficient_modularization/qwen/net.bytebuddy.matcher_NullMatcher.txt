    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with all being public (nopm=3), 1 field (nof=1), and 27 lines of code (loc=27). The weighted method count (wmc=3) indicates low complexity. With such a small number of methods and low complexity, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
