    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 50 lines of code (loc=50). The low number of methods and fields, combined with the relatively small size, indicates sufficient modularization. There is no evidence of excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
