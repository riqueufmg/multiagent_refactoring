    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 0 methods, with 99 lines of code. While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and lack of complexity metrics (WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0) suggest this is a simple data class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current purpose."
