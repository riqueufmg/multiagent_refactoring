    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodNameTransformer.Suffixing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=2, nopf=0), and 33 lines of code (loc=33). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, DIT is 1 showing no inheritance depth, and LCOM is -1.0 which indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. Fan-in and fan-out are both 0, indicating no external dependencies or usage."
