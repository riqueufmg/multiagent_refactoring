    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.FieldToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields and 59 lines of code, which is relatively small. It has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and no dependencies other than a build plugin annotation. The low number of fields and absence of complex behavior or high complexity metrics indicate sufficient modularization."
