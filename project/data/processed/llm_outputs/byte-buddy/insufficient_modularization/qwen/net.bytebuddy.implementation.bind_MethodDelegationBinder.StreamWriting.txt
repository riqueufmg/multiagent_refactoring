    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.StreamWriting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=60 but this appears to be the enclosing class), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low structural complexity indicates it is already sufficiently modularized. No further decomposition is needed as the class does not contain implementation complexity that would benefit from additional modularization."
