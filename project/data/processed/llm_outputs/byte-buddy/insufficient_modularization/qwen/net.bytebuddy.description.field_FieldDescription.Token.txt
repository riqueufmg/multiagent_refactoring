    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 102 lines of code (loc=102). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low number of fields and methods suggests reasonable modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or token class with minimal complexity (wmc=0, nc=0). The dependencies are limited and related to core functionality."
