    "class": "org.gradle.work.FileChange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2) and 15 lines of code (loc=15), which indicates a very small and simple class. With 0 fields (nof=0) and only 2 dependencies, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low complexity metrics suggest this class is appropriately sized and does not require further decomposition."
