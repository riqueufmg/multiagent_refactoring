    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Record",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 3 fields (nof=3), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 0 public methods (nopm=0). With only 3 fields and no methods, the class is already minimally decomposed. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate that further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity. The class appears to be a simple data structure or placeholder rather than a complex entity requiring modularization."
