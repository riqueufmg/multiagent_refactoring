    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 1 public field, 0 methods, 0 public methods, and only 17 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class that is already sufficiently modularized given its minimal functionality."
