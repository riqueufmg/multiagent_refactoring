    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 54 lines of code (loc=54), and minimal dependencies. The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed. The class appears to be a simple inner class with limited functionality that does not require further decomposition."
