{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (18) and a large size in terms of lines of code (442 LOC), with only 3 methods. The low method-to-field ratio (3 methods for 18 fields) and high lines of code indicate insufficient decomposition. The class likely encompasses multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive classes."
