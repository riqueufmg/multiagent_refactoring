    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 49 lines of code (loc=49). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0). The class appears to be a simple, well-focused inner class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
