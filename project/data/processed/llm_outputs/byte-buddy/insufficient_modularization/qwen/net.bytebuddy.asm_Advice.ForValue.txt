{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 257 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has 11 fields (nof) which suggests it is managing multiple responsibilities. With 0 methods (nom) and 0 public methods (nopm), the class appears to be a data-only class that may be doing too much work in its constructors or through direct field access, further indicating insufficient modularization."
