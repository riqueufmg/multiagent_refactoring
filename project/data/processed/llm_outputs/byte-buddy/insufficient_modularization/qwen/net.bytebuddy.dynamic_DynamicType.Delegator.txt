    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Delegator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 263 lines of code which is relatively large, but without method count (nom=0) and weighted method count (wmc=0) metrics available, it's not possible to determine if the class has insufficient modularization. The lack of method metrics prevents assessment of implementation complexity that would indicate need for further decomposition."
