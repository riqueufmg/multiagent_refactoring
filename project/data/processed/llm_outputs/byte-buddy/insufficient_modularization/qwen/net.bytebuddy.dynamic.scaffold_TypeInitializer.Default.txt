    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 34 lines of code (loc=34). With such a small size and minimal complexity, there is no indication of insufficient modularization. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class that does not require further decomposition."
