    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 72 lines of code (loc=72). The low number of fields (nof=2) and no dependencies flowing out (fanout=0) indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
