    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Node",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 51 lines of code (loc=51). With minimal complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0) and no dependencies flowing in or out (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be sufficiently modularized. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggests it serves a single, focused purpose as a data container or simple node structure."
