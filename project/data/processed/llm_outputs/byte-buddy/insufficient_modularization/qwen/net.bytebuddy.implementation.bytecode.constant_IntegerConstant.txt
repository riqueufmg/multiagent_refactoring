    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 5 methods and 155 lines of code. The WMC of 14 indicates manageable complexity. LCOM of 0.6 suggests reasonable cohesion. The class has no fields (nof=5, nc=0) and minimal inheritance (DIT=1). While there are 5 methods, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be well-contained with focused functionality."
