    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.SelfInjection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 fields (nof=8) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 264 lines of code (loc=264). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and field count do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a data-only class or configuration holder rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. No complexity metrics (wmc=0) or inheritance depth (dit=0) suggest the need for further modularization."
