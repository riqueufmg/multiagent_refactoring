    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high lines of code (509 loc) with only 4 methods (nom), indicating low method density and potential complexity. The class has 16 fields (nof) and 3 nested classes (nc), suggesting it encapsulates too much functionality. The low method-to-field ratio (4 methods for 16 fields) and high lines of code suggest this class could benefit from decomposition to improve modularity and reduce complexity."
