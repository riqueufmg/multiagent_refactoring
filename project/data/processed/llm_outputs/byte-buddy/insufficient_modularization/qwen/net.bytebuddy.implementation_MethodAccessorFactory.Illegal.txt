    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodAccessorFactory.Illegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and minimal size (loc=25). WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or marker class with no substantial implementation that would require further decomposition. DIT=1 indicates no inheritance hierarchy complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests good cohesion (though negative values can indicate special cases like marker classes). The low metrics across all complexity measures indicate this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently simple and decomposed."
