    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a manageable size with 276 lines of code and 9 methods. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) is 42, which is within acceptable limits. The class appears to be a generated JMH benchmark test class, which typically contains many similar methods due to code generation patterns. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (both 0) suggests it's a self-contained test class with minimal external interactions. No complex metrics indicating high complexity or insufficient modularization are present."
