    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.WithPreprocessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and it has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). This suggests the class is already sufficiently modularized as it contains minimal functionality and does not exhibit signs of needing further decomposition."
