```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 fields (nof=14) and 5 methods (nom=5) with a total of 274 lines of code (loc=274). The high number of fields relative to methods, combined with substantial lines of code, indicates insufficient modularization where further decomposition could reduce size and complexity. The class directly manages dependencies to 15 external classes, suggesting it has multiple responsibilities and could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more focused components."
