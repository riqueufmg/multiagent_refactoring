    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.NullValueGuard",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 134 lines of code (loc=134). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of fields, the lack of methods and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) indicate this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current purpose."
