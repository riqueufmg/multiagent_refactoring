    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 37 lines of code (loc=37), with a low weighted method count (wmc=7). The low number of methods and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization as there is no evidence of complex implementation that could be further decomposed."
