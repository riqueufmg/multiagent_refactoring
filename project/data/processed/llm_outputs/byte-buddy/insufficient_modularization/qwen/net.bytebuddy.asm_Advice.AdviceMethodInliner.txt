    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 fields (nof=16) and 235 lines of code (loc=235), but lacks sufficient metric data to confirm insufficient modularization. Key metrics like number of methods (nom=0), weighted method count (wmc=0), and lack of fan-in/fan-out data prevent definitive detection. While the LOC count is moderate, the absence of method complexity metrics and dependency usage patterns makes it impossible to determine if further decomposition is needed."
