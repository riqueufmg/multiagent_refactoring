    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable.OfMandatable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 15 lines of code (loc=15). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating no computational complexity. With such minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly decomposed or represents a simple data structure."
