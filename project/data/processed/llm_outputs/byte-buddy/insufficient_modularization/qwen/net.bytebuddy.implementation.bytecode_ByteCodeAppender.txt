    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with WMC=1, only 1 method (NOM=1) and 5 fields (NOF=5). The lines of code (LOC=131) are reasonable for a class with this level of functionality. The lack of inheritance (DIT=0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest appropriate modularization. No clear indication of insufficient decomposition based on the provided metrics."
