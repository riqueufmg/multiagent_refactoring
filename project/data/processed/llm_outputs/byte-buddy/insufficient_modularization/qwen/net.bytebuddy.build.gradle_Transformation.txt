```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Transformation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) with 9 public methods (nopm=9), high weighted method count (wmc=22), and 221 lines of code (loc=221). The high number of methods and lines of code indicates the class is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The WMC value of 22 suggests high implementation complexity that could be reduced through modularization."
