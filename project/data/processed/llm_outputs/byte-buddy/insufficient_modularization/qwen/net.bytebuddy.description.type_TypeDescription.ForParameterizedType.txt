    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForParameterizedType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 205 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has 4 fields (nof) but no methods (nom), suggesting poor modularization where data and behavior are not properly encapsulated together. The lack of methods despite having fields indicates insufficient decomposition of responsibilities."
