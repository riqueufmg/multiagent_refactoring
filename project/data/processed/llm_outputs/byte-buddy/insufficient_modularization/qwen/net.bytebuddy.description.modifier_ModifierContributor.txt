    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (204 LOC), low complexity (WMC=3), few methods (3), and few fields (10). While it has nested classes (8 nested classes), the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be properly modularized for its intended purpose."
