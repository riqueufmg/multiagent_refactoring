    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.TerminationHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 29 lines of code (loc=29). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. With no methods or fields to decompose further, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately simple and focused."
