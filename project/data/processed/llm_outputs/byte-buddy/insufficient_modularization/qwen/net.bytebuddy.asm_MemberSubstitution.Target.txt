    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Target",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 117 lines of code (loc=117). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, this appears to be a data class or value object that holds member substitution target information. The lack of methods (wmc=0) and simple structure without complex behavior does not indicate insufficient modularization - it's appropriately simple for its purpose."
