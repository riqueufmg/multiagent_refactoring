    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Matchable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 42 lines of code, zero methods (nom=0), zero fields (nof=0), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. While it's an interface (implied by Matchable naming convention), it shows no signs of insufficient modularization given its minimal size and complexity metrics."
