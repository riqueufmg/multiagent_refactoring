    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Disabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely a marker class or interface implementation. With minimal functionality and low LOC (84), it does not exhibit complexity that would require further decomposition. The absence of methods (wmc=0) confirms low implementation complexity that would benefit from modularization."
