{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3) and 12 fields (nof=12), with 381 lines of code. While the LOC count is moderate, the method count is low and complexity metrics (WMC=3, LCOM=-1.0) indicate reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be a cohesive naming strategy component with appropriate responsibilities, and there's no clear indication that further decomposition would significantly reduce size or complexity."
