    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 85 lines of code (loc=85). It has minimal fields (nof=3) and no public fields (nopf=0). The low method count and complexity metrics indicate it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
