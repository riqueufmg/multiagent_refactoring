    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 60 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). There are no indicators of high complexity or size that would suggest insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple dispatcher implementation with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
