    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.SimpleMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 36 lines of code (loc=36), and no dependencies or coupling metrics indicating complexity. The low number of fields and methods suggests it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
