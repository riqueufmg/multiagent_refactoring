    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 42 fields (nof=42), 7 methods (nom=7), and 2457 lines of code (loc=2457), indicating a large and complex class that could benefit from further decomposition. The high number of fields and lines of code suggest that the class is handling multiple responsibilities and has not been completely decomposed, which aligns with the characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
