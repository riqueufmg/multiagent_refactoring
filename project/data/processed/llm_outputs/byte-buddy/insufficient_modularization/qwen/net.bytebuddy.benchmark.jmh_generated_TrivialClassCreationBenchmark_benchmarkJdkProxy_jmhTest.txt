    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 methods (nom=9) with 42 weighted method complexity (wmc=42), 263 lines of code (loc=275), and 263 fields (nof=263). While the number of fields is high, the low method count and moderate complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a generated benchmark test class with a single responsibility pattern."
