    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 48 lines of code (loc). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof) and no method parameters (nopm). The low size and complexity metrics indicate sufficient modularization has already been achieved."
