    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ResubmissionOnErrorMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 165 lines of code (loc=165). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and fields suggest it's already well-decomposed. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class needing further decomposition."
