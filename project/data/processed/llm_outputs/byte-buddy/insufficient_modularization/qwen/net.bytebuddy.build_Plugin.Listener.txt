```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Listener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 550 lines of code (loc=550). While the LOC is somewhat high for a class with few methods, the low method count and lack of complex metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) suggest this is likely a data-only class or simple listener implementation rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The absence of methods indicates it may be serving a specific, limited purpose."
