{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 46 lines of code (loc=46), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple abstract base class with minimal functionality that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
