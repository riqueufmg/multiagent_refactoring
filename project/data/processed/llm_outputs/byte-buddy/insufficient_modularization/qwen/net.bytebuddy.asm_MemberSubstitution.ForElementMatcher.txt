    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForElementMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 46 lines of code (loc=46). With minimal methods and relatively low lines of code, the class does not exhibit high complexity or size that would indicate insufficient modularization. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) suggests this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
