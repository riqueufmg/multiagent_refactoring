    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 22 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and a WMC of 0. The low size and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition is not necessary. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its minimal implementation."
