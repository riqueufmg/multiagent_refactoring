    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods (nom=7, wmc=7) and 118 lines of code (loc=118), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The class has low complexity with no public fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and no public methods (nopm=0). The negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) suggests good cohesion among the methods. The class has 3 nested classes (nc=3) which is reasonable for its size and complexity. Fan-in and fan-out are both zero, indicating limited external dependencies. Based on these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains a reasonable size and complexity level."
