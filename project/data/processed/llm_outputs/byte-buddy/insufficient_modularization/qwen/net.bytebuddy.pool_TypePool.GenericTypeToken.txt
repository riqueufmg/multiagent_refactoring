    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.GenericTypeToken",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 96 fields (nof=96) and 1711 lines of code (loc=1711), indicating excessive size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential incomplete decomposition where functionality may be embedded within large field structures or external dependencies. High field count and substantial LOC without corresponding methods are indicators of insufficient modularization where the class has not been properly decomposed into smaller, more manageable components."
