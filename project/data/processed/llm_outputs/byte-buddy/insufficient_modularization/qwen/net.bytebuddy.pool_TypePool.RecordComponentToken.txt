    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields and 0 methods, with 53 lines of code. The low number of methods (0) and fields (6) indicates minimal complexity. WMC is 0, suggesting no method complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or token class with limited functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
