{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (17) and a large size in terms of lines of code (407 LOC), with only 4 methods, indicating potential insufficient modularization. The high LCOM value (0.75) suggests weak cohesion among the class components, and the presence of multiple inner classes and dependencies indicates that further decomposition could reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
