    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with 70 lines of code. While the LOC is moderate, the low number of fields and methods indicates minimal complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or value object with no behavioral complexity that would warrant further decomposition. No signs of insufficient modularization are present given the limited scope and complexity of this class."
