{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Origin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 109 lines of code (loc=109). While the class has some dependencies on 3 other classes, the low number of fields and methods indicates it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) suggests this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
