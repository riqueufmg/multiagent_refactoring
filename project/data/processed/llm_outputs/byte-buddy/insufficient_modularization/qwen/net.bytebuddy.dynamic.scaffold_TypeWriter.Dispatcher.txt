    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 57 lines of code (loc=57). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and very low complexity metrics indicate this is likely an interface or abstract class that is properly modularized. The low line count and minimal field count do not suggest insufficient modularization."
