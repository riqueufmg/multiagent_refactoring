    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.ConstructorResolver.ForInstrumentedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. With minimal functionality and low size, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly decomposed."
