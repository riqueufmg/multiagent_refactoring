    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy.WrappingDispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 fields and 0 methods, with 104 lines of code. While the LOC count is moderately high for the number of fields, the class lacks sufficient complexity (0 methods, 0 weighted method count) to indicate insufficient modularization. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
