    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 52 lines of code (loc=52). The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. The class represents a specific, focused concept (attached type variable) and does not exhibit characteristics of insufficient modularization such as excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
