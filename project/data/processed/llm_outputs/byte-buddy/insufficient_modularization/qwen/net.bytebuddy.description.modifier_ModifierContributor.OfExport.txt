    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=9, but this includes minimal structural code), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). It has only 1 field (nof=1) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class appears to be a simple, well-decomposed structural element rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
