{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.DirectInvoker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal complexity. With such low complexity and minimal functionality, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed for its current scope and responsibilities."
