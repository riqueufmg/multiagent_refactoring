    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkCglib_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a manageable size with 276 lines of code and 9 methods. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) is 42, which is moderate. With only 263 fields, the class complexity is reasonable for a generated benchmark test class. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies suggests it's a self-contained generated test class rather than a complex business logic class that requires decomposition."
