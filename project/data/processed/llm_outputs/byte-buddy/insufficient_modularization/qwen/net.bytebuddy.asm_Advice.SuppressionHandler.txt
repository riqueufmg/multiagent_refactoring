    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.SuppressionHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 184 lines of code (loc=184). While the class has a relatively high number of lines of code, the low number of fields and methods suggests it may already be sufficiently decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) indicates this might be a data-only class or interface, and the low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) support that it's not overly complex. Without evidence of high complexity or numerous responsibilities, insufficient modularization cannot be confirmed."
