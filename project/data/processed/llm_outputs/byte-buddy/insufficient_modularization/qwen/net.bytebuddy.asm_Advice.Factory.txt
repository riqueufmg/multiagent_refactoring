{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0), and 112 lines of code (loc=112). While the class has some dependencies on 12 external types, the low number of fields and absence of methods suggests it is already sufficiently decomposed. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
