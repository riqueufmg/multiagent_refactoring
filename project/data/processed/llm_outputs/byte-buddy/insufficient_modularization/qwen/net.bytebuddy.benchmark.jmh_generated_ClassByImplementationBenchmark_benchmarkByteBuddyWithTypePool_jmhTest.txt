    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithTypePool_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a manageable size with 276 lines of code and 9 methods. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) is 42, which is moderate. With 263 fields, the class is data-heavy but this is typical for JMH-generated benchmark test classes that contain numerous state fields for benchmark execution. The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion among methods and fields. The class appears to be a generated benchmark test class with a single responsibility pattern, and its structure is appropriate for its intended use case."
