{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Disabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 19 lines of code (loc=19). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While it has one dependency on net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, the class itself is minimal and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
