    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.ForLegacyVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 27 lines of code (loc=27) and zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0). All other complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0) indicate minimal complexity. The class appears to be a simple, lightweight component that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed."
