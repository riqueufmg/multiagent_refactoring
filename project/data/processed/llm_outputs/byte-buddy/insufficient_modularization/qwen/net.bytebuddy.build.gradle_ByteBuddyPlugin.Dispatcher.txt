    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyPlugin.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 90 lines of code (loc=90). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low complexity indicates this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further modularization."
