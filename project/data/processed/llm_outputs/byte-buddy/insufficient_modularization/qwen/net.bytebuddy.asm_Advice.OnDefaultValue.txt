    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OnDefaultValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 11 lines of code (loc=11) and zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0). The low size and minimal implementation complexity indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple nature."
