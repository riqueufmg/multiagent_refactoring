    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Substitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 215 fields and 4607 lines of code, indicating excessive size and complexity for a single class. The high number of dependencies (23 external types) suggests it has too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The lack of methods (0) despite having many fields indicates poor encapsulation and design, supporting the presence of Insufficient Modularization."
