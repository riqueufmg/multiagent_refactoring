    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaMethodImplementation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 190 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality that should be decomposed into smaller classes. The class has 9 fields (nof) but no methods (nom), suggesting it may be a data class with embedded logic or implementation details that should be modularized. The lack of methods (nom=0) combined with substantial size (loc=190) indicates insufficient decomposition of responsibilities."
