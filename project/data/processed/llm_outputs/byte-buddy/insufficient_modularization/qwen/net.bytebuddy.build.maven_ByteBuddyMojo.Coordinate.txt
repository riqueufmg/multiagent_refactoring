    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.Coordinate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 34 lines of code (loc=34), and no dependencies. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0, nom=0) indicates this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class that doesn't require further decomposition. The metrics suggest this is a minimal, focused class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
