    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 147 lines of code (loc=147). The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well modularized. There are no complex internal structures or excessive responsibilities that would suggest insufficient modularization."
