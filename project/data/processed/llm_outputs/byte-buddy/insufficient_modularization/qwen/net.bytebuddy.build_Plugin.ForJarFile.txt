    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 37 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 weighted method count. The lack of methods and low LOC indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex module requiring refactoring."
