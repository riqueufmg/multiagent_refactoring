    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddy_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (276 LOC, 263 fields), low complexity (WMC=42), and minimal method count (9 methods). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the single dependency suggests appropriate encapsulation. While the field count is high, this appears to be a generated benchmark test class which typically requires many fields for JMH framework integration. The metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class seems appropriately scoped for its purpose."
