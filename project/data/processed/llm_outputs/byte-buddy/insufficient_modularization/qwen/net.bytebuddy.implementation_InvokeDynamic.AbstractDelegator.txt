    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 202 lines of code which is not excessively large, but more importantly, the metrics show 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), suggesting this is likely an abstract base class or interface that serves as a structural foundation rather than a complex implementation. The WMC of 0 further confirms minimal complexity. Without evidence of high complexity or numerous responsibilities, insufficient modularization cannot be detected."
