    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.JavaConstantValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 68 lines of code (loc=68), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1, nopf=0) and no class dependencies (nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to be well-focused and not overly complex. The lack of significant complexity metrics and reasonable size does not indicate insufficient modularization."
