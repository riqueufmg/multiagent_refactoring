    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 299 lines of code (loc=299). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and low complexity metrics indicate this is a simple factory class that is already sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
