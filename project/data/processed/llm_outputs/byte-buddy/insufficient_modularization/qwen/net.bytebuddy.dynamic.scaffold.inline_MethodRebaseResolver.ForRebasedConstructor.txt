    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with WMC=0, NOM=0, and only 4 fields. The LOC is 125 which is moderate, and there are no methods to indicate implementation complexity. While the class has several dependencies (8), this alone does not indicate insufficient modularization given the simple internal structure."
