    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (130 LOC) and complexity (WMC=11) for its functionality. With only 3 methods (2 public) and 5 fields, it maintains focused responsibility. The LCOM value of 0.667 indicates acceptable cohesion. The metrics do not indicate excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
