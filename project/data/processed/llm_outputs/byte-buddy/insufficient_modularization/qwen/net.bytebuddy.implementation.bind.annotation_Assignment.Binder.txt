    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and relatively small size (loc=64). The lack of methods and low field count indicates it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
