    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.Injecting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 0 methods, with 172 lines of code. While the LOC is relatively high, the low number of fields and methods indicates minimal complexity. The WMC is 0, suggesting no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which may indicate good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
