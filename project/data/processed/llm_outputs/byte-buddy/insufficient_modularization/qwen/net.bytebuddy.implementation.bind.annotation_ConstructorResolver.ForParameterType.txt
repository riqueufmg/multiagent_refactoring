{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.ConstructorResolver.ForParameterType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class is nested (indicated by the dot in the name), its extremely small size and low complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, well-contained component."
