    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with low complexity (wmc=4), contains 35 lines of code (loc=35) which is relatively small, has only 1 field (nof=1), and shows good cohesion (lcom=1.0). The low number of methods, low cyclomatic complexity, and small size indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
