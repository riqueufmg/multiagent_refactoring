    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 69 lines of code (loc=69). The low number of methods and fields, combined with the relatively small size, does not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-contained component with minimal complexity (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0)."
