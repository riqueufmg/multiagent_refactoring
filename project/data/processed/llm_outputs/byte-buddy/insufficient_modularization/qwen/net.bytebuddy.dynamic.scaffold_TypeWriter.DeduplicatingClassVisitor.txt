    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.DeduplicatingClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 29 lines of code (loc=29). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. With such low size and complexity metrics, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly decomposed or represents a simple component that doesn't require further decomposition."
