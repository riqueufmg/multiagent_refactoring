{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForTopLevelType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=34 but this appears to be the file location rather than class size), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low complexity indicates sufficient modularization as there is no evidence of un-decomposed functionality that needs further breakdown."
