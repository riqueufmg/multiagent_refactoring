    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender.Target",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 167 lines of code (loc=167). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and fields suggest it may be a simple data class or nested class. Without evidence of high complexity, lack of cohesion, or clear decomposition opportunities, insufficient modularization cannot be confirmed with the provided metrics."
