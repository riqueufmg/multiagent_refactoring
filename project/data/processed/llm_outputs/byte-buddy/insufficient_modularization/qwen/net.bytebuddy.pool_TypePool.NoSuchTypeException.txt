{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.NoSuchTypeException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, 28 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple exception class with insufficient functionality to exhibit insufficient modularization."
