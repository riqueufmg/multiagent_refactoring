    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.BridgeTarget",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 76 lines of code (loc=76). While the class is nested within TypeWriter, its size and complexity are relatively low. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration object rather than a complex class that requires further decomposition."
