    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.WithoutResubmissionSpecification",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 78 lines of code (loc=78). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods or fields to decompose, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be a simple specification or configuration class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
