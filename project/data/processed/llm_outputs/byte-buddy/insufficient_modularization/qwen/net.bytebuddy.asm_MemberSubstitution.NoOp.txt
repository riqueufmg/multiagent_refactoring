    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is a minimal implementation. With only 31 lines of code (loc=31) and no complexity metrics suggesting issues (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0), this appears to be a simple, well-contained class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The lack of methods and fields suggests this is likely a marker or configuration class rather than a complex implementation requiring decomposition."
