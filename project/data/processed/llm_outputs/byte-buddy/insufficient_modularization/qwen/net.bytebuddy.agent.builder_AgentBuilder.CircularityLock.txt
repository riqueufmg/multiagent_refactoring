{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.CircularityLock",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 201 lines of code (loc=201). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and field count indicate minimal complexity. The WMC is 0, indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
