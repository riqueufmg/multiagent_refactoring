    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.FrameWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 96 lines of code (loc=96). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity metrics indicate this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The absence of dependencies and low complexity metrics suggest sufficient modularization for its current purpose."
