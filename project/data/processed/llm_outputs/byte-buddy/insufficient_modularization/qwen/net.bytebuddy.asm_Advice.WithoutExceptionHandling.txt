    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithoutExceptionHandling",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 49 lines of code (loc=49). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. There are no dependencies on other classes within the provided data, and the class appears to be a simple, well-decomposed component. The metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class is already minimal in size and complexity."
