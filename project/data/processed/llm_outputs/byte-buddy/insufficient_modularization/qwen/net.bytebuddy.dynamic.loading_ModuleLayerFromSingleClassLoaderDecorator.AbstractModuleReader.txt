    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal size with only 58 lines of code, and no dependencies or coupling metrics indicating complexity. The lack of methods and low LOC suggest it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
