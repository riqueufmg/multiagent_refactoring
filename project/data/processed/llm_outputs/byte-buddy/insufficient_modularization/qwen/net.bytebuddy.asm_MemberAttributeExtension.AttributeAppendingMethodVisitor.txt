    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension.AttributeAppendingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields (nof=4), no methods (nom=0), 48 lines of code (loc=48), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or visitor implementation with limited functionality."
