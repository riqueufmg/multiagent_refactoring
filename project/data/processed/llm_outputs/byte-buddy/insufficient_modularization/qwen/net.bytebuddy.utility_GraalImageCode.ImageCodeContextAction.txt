{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.GraalImageCode.ImageCodeContextAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 21 lines of code (loc=21). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies outside its own package. This indicates a minimal, well-modularized class that does not require further decomposition."
