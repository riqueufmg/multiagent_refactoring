    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 87 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond the parent class. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
