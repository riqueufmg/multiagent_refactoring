    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList.Executable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 23 lines of code (loc=23). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating no computational complexity. The class appears to be a simple, minimal implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it lacks the complexity that would require further decomposition."
