{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.WithLazyResolution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 459 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has 10 fields (nof) and depends on 6 external dependencies, suggesting it has multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further modularization to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
