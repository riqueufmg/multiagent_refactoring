    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForEnumerationValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 49 lines of code (loc=49), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or value object rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
