    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.SuperClassCheck",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low LOC count (30). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While it has dependencies on StackManipulation and MethodVariableAccess, the class itself appears to be sufficiently modularized given its minimal size and complexity. No further decomposition is warranted for such a lightweight class."
