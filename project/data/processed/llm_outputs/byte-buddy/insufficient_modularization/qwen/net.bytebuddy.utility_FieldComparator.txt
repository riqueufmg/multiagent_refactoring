    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=22), and minimal complexity metrics (wmc=3). With such a small size and low complexity, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
