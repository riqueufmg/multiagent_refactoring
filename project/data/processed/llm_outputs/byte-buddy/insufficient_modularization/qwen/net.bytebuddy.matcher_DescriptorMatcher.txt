    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.DescriptorMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), low weighted method count (wmc=3), and minimal lines of code (loc=26). The lack of fields (nof=1) and low method count indicate proper modularization. No complex dependencies or high coupling metrics suggest insufficient modularization issues."
