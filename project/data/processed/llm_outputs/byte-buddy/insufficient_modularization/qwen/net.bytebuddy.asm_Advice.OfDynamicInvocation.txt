    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 54 lines of code (loc=54). The low number of fields and methods, combined with the relatively small size, indicates sufficient modularization. There are no complex metrics suggesting the need for further decomposition."
