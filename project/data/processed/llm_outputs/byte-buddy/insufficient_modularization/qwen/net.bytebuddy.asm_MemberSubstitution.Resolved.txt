    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Resolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 39 lines of code (loc=39). The low number of fields and methods, combined with the relatively small size, indicates sufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
