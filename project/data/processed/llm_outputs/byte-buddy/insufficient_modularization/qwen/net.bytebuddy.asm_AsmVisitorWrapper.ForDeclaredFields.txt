{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.ForDeclaredFields",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 136 lines of code (loc=136). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low number of fields and methods suggests the class is already well-decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) indicates this may be a data-only class or nested class with minimal behavior, which is appropriate for its current structure. No complex dependencies or high complexity metrics indicate insufficient modularization."
