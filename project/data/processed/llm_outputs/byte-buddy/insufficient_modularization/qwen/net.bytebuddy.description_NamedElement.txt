    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.NamedElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 3 fields (nof=3), and 72 lines of code. The low number of methods and fields indicates proper modularization. LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion among the class members. The class does not exhibit signs of needing further decomposition as it maintains a focused responsibility with minimal complexity."
