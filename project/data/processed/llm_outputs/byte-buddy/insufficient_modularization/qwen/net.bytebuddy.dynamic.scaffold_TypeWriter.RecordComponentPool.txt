{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.RecordComponentPool",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0), and relatively small size (loc=163). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. While the class has dependencies on 4 external types, this alone does not indicate insufficient modularization given the simple structure."
