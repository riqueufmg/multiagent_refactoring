    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19) with 17 public methods (nopm=17), 4 fields (nof=4) and 238 lines of code (loc=238). While the class has moderate size, the WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 22 which indicates moderate complexity. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion in Methods) is 0.21 which suggests reasonable cohesion. The class has a DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) of 1, indicating no inheritance. Given these metrics, the class does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains reasonable cohesion and manageable complexity for its size."
