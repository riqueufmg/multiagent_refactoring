{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods (nom=6) and 331 lines of code (loc=331), indicating substantial size and complexity. The presence of multiple nested classes (Factory, JdkClassReader, ForClassFileApi, Default) and numerous dependencies (9 total) suggests that the class contains too much functionality and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
