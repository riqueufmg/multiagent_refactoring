{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AdviceVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 428 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating high implementation complexity. The class has 13 fields (nof) but no methods (nom=0), suggesting incomplete decomposition where method implementations may be overly complex or the class may need further breakdown into smaller, more focused components. The high line count combined with the field-to-method ratio indicates insufficient modularization."
