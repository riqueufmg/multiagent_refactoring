    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 78 lines of code, which is relatively small. With 0 methods and 0 complexity metrics (wmc, nc, dit), there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed."
