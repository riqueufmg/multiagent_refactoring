    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner.OfGenericArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 36 lines of code (loc=36). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, lightweight component with limited responsibilities."
