    "justification": "The class has 16 fields but no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), suggesting it may be a data-only class or nested static class. The LOC is 169 which is moderate, and without method complexity metrics or clear decomposition opportunities visible from the metrics, there's insufficient evidence to conclude it suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
