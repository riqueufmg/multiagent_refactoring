{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Adjustment.ErrorHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 35 lines of code (loc=35). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal computational complexity. While the class is nested (ErrorHandler within Adjustment), its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization - it appears to be appropriately sized for its current functionality."
