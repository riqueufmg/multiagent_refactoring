{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 26 lines of code (loc=26) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0, wmc=0). The lack of methods and low code size indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) further suggests good cohesion, and zero fan-in and fan-out indicate minimal coupling."
