    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayAccess",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 5 methods (4 public) and WMC of 14, which is manageable. The LOC is 136 which is reasonable for a class handling array access operations. LCOM of 1.0 indicates good cohesion. The number of fields (3) and methods (5) suggests appropriate size and responsibility scope. No clear indication of functionality that should be further decomposed."
