    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ModuleToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 fields (nof=10) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 78 lines of code (loc=78). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and very simple structure indicates it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or token class with minimal complexity that does not require further decomposition."
