{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Tokenized",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 22 lines of code (loc=22), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or token class with no significant functionality to decompose."
