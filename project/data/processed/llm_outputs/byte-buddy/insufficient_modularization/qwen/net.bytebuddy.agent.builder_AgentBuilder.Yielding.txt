    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Yielding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 26 lines of code (loc=26). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods or fields to decompose further, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already at a minimal decomposition level."
