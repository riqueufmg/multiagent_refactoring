    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high lines of code (loc=283) with zero methods (nom=0) and zero fields (nof=0), indicating that all functionality is likely implemented within nested or inner constructs rather than being properly decomposed into separate methods or classes. The high number of dependencies (16 modifier classes) suggests complex logic that should be further modularized, but the lack of any declared methods or fields indicates insufficient decomposition of responsibilities."
