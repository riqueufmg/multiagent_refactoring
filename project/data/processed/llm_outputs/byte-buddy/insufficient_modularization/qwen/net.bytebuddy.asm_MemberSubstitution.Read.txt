    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 49 lines of code (loc). It has minimal dependencies (5) and no fan-in or fan-out relationships. The low number of fields (1) and lack of methods indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
