    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.LambdaFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 4 fields (nof=4), with 117 lines of code (loc=117). The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, indicating low complexity. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest a simple, focused class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
