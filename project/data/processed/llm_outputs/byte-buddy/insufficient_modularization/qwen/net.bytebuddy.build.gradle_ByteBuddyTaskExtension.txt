    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTaskExtension",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (80 LOC) and complexity (WMC=11, NOM=11) with good cohesion (LCOM=0.18). The low number of fields (NOF=3) and methods (NOM=11) indicates it's already well-decomposed. DIT=1 shows it doesn't inherit from other classes, and fanin/fanout=0 indicates minimal external dependencies. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its responsibilities."
