    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.OrderedReiteratingIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 58 lines of code (loc=58). The lack of methods suggests this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. Without any methods present, there is no implementation complexity to reduce through modularization."
