    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 22 lines of code (loc=22). It also has minimal dependencies with only 2 fanout connections. The low size and complexity indicate sufficient modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
