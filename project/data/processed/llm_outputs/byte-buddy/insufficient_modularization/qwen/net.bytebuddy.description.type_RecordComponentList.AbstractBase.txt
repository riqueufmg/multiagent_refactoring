    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 39 lines of code (loc=39). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) and it has no direct dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). With minimal functionality and low complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed."
