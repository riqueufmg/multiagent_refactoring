    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple, well-decomposed unit with no evidence of insufficient modularization."
