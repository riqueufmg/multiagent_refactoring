    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 126 lines of code (loc=126). While the class has some fields, the low method count and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or value object with minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
