    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForClassLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 208 lines of code (loc) which is relatively high for a single class, and it has 3 fields (nof) but 0 methods (nom), indicating poor decomposition where data and behavior are not properly organized. The class also has a WMC of 0 which suggests methods may be overly complex or improperly distributed. The high number of dependencies (5) with no fan-in or fan-out metrics suggests potential over-dependence without proper modularization."
