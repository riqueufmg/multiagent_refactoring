    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.ConstructorResolver.Instantiation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields, 0 methods, and 66 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no public methods (nopm=0, nopf=0). The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
