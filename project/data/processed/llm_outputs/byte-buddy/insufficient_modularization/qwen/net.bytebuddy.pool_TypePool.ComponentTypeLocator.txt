    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ComponentTypeLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with 104 lines of code. While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low complexity metrics (WMC=0, NOM=0) and minimal dependencies suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class needing decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple structure."
