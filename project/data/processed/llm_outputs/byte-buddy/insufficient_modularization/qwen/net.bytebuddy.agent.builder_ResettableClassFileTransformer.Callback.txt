    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is likely an empty or marker interface/class. With only 30 lines of code (loc=30) and no complexity (wmc=0), the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition. The lack of methods and fields suggests it serves a specific, simple purpose without internal complexity that would benefit from modularization."
