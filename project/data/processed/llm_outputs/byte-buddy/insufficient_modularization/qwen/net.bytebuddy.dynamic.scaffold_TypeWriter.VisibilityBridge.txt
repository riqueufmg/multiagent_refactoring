```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.VisibilityBridge",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 76 lines of code (loc=76). The lack of methods (nopm=0, nopf=0) and low WMC (0) indicates minimal implementation complexity. While the class has dependencies on 6 other types, this is not excessive given its role as a visibility bridge component. The metrics do not indicate sufficient size or complexity to warrant further decomposition."
