{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.InjectionClassLoader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a manageable size with 107 lines of code and 7 methods, which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) is 8, indicating low complexity. The Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM) is 0.286, which is relatively low and suggests good cohesion. With only 1 field and 2 nested classes, the class is not overly complex in terms of attributes. The low number of methods (7 total, 4 public) and fields indicates the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
