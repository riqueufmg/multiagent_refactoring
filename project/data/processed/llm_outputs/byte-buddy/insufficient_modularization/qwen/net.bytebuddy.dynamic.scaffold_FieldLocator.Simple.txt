    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 48 lines of code, and no dependencies on other classes. The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
