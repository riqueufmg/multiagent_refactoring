    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.GenericTypeRegistrant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), low lines of code (loc=121), and no inheritance (dit=0, wmc=0). It also has minimal dependencies with only 1 fan-out dependency and no fan-in dependencies. The low metric values indicate this class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
