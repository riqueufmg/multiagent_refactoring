    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 16 lines of code (loc=16). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple abstract base class or interface with no substantial implementation that would require further decomposition."
