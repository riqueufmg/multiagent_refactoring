    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList.TypeSubstituting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 49 lines of code, 4 fields, and 0 methods. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal method complexity. While it has 3 dependencies, the class appears to be appropriately focused on its specific responsibility of type substitution within parameter lists. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class seems properly decomposed for its intended functionality."
