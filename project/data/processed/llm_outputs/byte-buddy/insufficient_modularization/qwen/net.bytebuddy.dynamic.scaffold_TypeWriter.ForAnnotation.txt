    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForAnnotation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 118 lines of code (loc=118). The lack of methods and low line count indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, focused implementation with no evidence of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
