    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 0 methods, with 46 lines of code, indicating a relatively small and simple class. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) suggests it is already well-decomposed or serves a simple purpose. No clear indication of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
