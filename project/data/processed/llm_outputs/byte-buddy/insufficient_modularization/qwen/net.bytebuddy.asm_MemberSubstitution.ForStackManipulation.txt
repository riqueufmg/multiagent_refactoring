    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForStackManipulation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 20 fields (nof=20) and 336 lines of code (loc=336), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential incomplete decomposition where functionality may be embedded within field initializations or nested classes rather than properly modularized methods. The high field count combined with substantial LOC suggests this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
