    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 25 lines of code (loc=25). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While it has dependencies on 2 other classes, the class itself is minimal and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
