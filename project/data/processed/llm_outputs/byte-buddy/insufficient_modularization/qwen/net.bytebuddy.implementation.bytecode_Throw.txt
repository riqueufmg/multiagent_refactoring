    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Throw",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 2 public methods (nopm=2), with a very low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=2). The lines of code (loc=20) indicate a very small class. With only 2 methods that are likely simple getter/setter or basic operations, and no complex dependencies or fanout, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
