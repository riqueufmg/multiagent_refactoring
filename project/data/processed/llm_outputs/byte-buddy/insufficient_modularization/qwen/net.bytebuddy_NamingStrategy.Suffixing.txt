    "class": "net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy.Suffixing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 166 lines of code (loc=166). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate sufficient modularization for this particular class's purpose."
