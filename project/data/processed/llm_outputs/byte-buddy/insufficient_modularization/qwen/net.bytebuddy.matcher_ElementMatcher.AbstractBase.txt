    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 18 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). It appears to be a minimal abstract base class that likely serves as a simple interface or base implementation. There is insufficient evidence of complexity or size that would indicate incomplete decomposition requiring further modularization."
