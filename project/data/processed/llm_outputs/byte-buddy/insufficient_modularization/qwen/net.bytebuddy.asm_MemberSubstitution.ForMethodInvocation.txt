    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 fields (nof: 9) but no methods (nom: 0, nopm: 0, wmc: 0), suggesting it may be a data-only class rather than a complex class requiring decomposition. The LOC is 189 which is moderate, and without method complexity metrics or clear signs of high complexity, there's insufficient evidence to conclude this represents Insufficient Modularization."
