{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.AccessorMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 80 lines of code (loc=80). While the class has some complexity indicated by dependencies on 7 other classes and 80 lines of code, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
