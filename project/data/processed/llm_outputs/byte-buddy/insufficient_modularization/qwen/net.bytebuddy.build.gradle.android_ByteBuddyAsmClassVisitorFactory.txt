    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 20 lines of code (loc=20), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is also very low, suggesting minimal complexity. With such few methods and low complexity metrics, there is no indication that further decomposition would provide benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
