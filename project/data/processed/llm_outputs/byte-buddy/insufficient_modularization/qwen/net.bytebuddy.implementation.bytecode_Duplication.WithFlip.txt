    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication.WithFlip",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 46 lines of code (loc=46). It also has minimal dependencies with fanin=0 and fanout=0. The low number of fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0) indicate proper encapsulation. With such minimal functionality and complexity, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
