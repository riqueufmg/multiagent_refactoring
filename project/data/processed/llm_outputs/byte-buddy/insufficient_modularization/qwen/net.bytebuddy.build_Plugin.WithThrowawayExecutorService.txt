    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.WithThrowawayExecutorService",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 51 lines of code (loc=51). It has minimal functionality with only 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0). The low method count and low cyclomatic complexity indicate it is already well decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
