    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), low WMC (0), and only 84 lines of code (loc=84). It has a simple structure with only 2 fields and no parameters. The lack of methods and low complexity metrics indicate it is already sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
