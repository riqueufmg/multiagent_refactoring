    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 109 lines of code (loc=109). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low complexity indicates this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The class does not exhibit high complexity or size that would warrant further modularization."
