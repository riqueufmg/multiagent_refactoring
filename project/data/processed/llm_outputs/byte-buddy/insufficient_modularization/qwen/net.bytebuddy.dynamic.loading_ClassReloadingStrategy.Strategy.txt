    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy.Strategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4), 0 methods (nom=0), and 160 lines of code (loc=160). While the LOC is moderately high, the lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) indicates this is likely an interface or abstract class with minimal implementation complexity. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
