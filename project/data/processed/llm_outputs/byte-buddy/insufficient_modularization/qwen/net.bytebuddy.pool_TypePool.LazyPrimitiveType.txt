    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyPrimitiveType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields, 0 methods, and 58 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no public methods or fields that would suggest insufficient decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or primitive type wrapper with minimal functionality that does not require further modularization."
