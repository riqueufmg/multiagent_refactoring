    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.RuntimeClassPathResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 70 lines of code (loc=70). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and simple field count indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex entity requiring modularization."
