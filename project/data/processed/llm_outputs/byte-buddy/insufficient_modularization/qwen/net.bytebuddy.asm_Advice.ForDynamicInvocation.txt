    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForDynamicInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 99 lines of code (loc=99). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on 4 other classes and 99 lines of code, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The absence of methods (nom=0) indicates this may be a data-only class or nested class that serves a specific focused purpose within the Advice class hierarchy."
