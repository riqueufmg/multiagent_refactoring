    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ArrayTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with low complexity (wmc=2), very few lines of code (loc=15), and no fields (nof=0). The low number of methods and minimal complexity indicate that the class is already well-decomposed and does not require further modularization. The class appears to be a simple, focused component with minimal implementation complexity."
