    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 36 methods (nom=36) and 33 private methods (nopm=33), with a high WMC of 36, indicating high complexity. It also has a large LOC of 323, suggesting it is doing too much. The class has 15 fields (nof=15) and depends on 26 other classes, indicating it has many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
