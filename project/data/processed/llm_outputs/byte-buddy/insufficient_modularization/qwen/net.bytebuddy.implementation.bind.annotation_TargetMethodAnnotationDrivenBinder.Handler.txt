    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 fields (nof=9) but no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), suggesting it may be a data holder or configuration class rather than a complex procedural class. The LOC is 161 which is moderate in size. Without method complexity metrics (wmc=0) and with no indication of high complexity or numerous responsibilities, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that further decomposition is needed based on the provided metrics alone."
