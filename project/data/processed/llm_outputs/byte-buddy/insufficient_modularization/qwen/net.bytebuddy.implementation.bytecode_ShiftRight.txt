{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ShiftRight",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 3 public), low lines of code (93), low weighted method count (4), and reasonable LCOM value (0.5). While it does contain an inner class (ShiftRight.Unsigned), the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
