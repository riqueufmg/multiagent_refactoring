    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 99 lines of code, DIT of 1 indicating no inheritance depth, and zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0). While the class has 4 dependencies, the low internal complexity and lack of methods suggest it is already sufficiently decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
