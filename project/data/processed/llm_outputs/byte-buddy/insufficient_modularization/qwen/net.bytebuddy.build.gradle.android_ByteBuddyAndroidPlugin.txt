{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (24), a large size in terms of lines of code (528 LOC), and contains multiple inner classes and dependencies (12 listed dependencies). These factors indicate that the class likely encompasses too much responsibility and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and complexity."
