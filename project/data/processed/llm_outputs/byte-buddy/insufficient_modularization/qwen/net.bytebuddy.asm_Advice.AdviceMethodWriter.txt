{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AdviceMethodWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 fields (nof=15) and 236 lines of code (loc=236), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential incomplete decomposition where functionality may be embedded in anonymous classes or nested structures rather than being properly modularized. The high field count combined with substantial LOC suggests insufficient modularization as the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
