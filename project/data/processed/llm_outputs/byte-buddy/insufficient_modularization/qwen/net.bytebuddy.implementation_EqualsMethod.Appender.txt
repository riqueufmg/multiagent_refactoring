    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 77 lines of code (loc=77). While the class has dependencies on 7 other classes, the low method count and reasonable field count do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
