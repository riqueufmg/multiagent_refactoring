    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 fields (nof=19) and 547 lines of code (loc=547), indicating high size and complexity. It also contains multiple inner classes (NonSealing, Definition, Trivial, SealBaseLocator, Undefined) suggesting insufficient decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=1) despite high field count and LOC suggests poor modularization where functionality is likely embedded in complex field definitions or nested structures rather than being properly decomposed into smaller, focused methods."
