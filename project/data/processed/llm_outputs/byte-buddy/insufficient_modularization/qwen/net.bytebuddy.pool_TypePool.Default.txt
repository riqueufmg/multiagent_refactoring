    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 386 fields and 6861 lines of code, indicating excessive size and complexity. The high number of dependencies (26) suggests it has too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused modules. The lack of methods (nom: 0) and high field count indicate potential data-only structure that may encapsulate too much functionality or data, violating modularization principles."
