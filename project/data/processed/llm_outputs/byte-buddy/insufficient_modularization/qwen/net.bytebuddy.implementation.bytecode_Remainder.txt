    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Remainder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 fields (nof=2), and low lines of code (loc=46). The weighted method count (wmc=3) indicates minimal method complexity. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest a simple, well-contained class that does not require further decomposition."
