    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and relatively small size (loc=240). While it has 9 fields and 12 nested classes which suggests some complexity, the low method count and cyclomatic complexity indicate sufficient modularization. The class appears to be a well-contained matcher implementation with appropriate decomposition."
