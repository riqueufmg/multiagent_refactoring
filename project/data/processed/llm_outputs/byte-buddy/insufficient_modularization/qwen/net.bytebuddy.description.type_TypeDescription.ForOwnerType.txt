    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 36 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and WMC of 0. The LCOM value is -1.0 which indicates good cohesion. There are no fan-in or fan-out dependencies suggesting minimal coupling. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple structure and low complexity metrics."
