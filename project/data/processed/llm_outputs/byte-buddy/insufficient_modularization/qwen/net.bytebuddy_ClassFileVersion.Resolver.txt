    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low lines of code (loc=51). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While the class exists, its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, well-contained component."
