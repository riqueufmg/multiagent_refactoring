{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.MethodMatchAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=87 but this appears to be file-level LOC not class-level), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low complexity indicates insufficient data to determine insufficient modularization - the class appears to be a simple adapter or configuration class rather than a complex monolithic class that needs decomposition."
