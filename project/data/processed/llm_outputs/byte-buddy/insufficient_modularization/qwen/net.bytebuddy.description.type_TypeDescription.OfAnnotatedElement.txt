    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 16 lines of code (loc), zero methods (nom), zero fields (nof), and zero weighted method count (wmc). The lack of significant size and complexity indicates that further decomposition is not necessary, as there is insufficient content to warrant additional modularization."
