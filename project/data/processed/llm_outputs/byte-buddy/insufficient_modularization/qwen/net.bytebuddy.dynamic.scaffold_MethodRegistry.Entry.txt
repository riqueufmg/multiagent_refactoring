    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.Entry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 59 lines of code (loc=59). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and very limited functionality suggests this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate sufficient modularization for this class's intended purpose."
