    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 1 field (nof=1), and low lines of code (loc=26). The weighted method count (wmc=3) indicates simple method complexity. With only 2 public methods (nopm=2) and 1 total method, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
