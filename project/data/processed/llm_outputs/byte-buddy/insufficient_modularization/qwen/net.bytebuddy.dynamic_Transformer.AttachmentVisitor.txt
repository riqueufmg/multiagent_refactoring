    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 12 lines of code and 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0). It appears to be a simple data holder or marker class with no implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. The lack of methods and minimal code size indicates it is already sufficiently modularized for its purpose."
