{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Filtering",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 34 lines of code (loc=34), and a depth of inheritance of 1 (dit=1). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple filtering implementation with low size and complexity that does not warrant additional modularization."
