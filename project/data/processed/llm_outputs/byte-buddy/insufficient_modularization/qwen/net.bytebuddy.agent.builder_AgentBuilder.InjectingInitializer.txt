    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.InjectingInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 55 lines of code (loc), 5 fields (nof), 0 methods (nom), and a depth of inheritance tree of 1 (dit). The low number of methods and fields, combined with the relatively small size (55 loc), indicates that the class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
