    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lines of code (loc=54) are reasonable for a specialized inner class. There are no dependencies indicating excessive coupling, and the class appears to be a well-contained specialized component within the MethodCall implementation."
