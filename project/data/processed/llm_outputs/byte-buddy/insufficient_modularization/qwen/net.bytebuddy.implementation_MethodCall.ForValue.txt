{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 81 lines of code (loc=81). While the LOC is moderately high for a class with few methods, the low method count and field count indicate it is already well-decomposed. The class appears to be a specialized inner class (ForValue) within MethodCall implementation, serving a specific purpose with minimal complexity (wmc=0, nc=0). No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class seems appropriately focused."
