    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.FieldResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 fields and 250 lines of code, which is not excessive for a single class. There are no methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) indicating this may be a data-only class or interface. The low complexity metrics (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0) suggest minimal internal complexity that would benefit from decomposition. The number of dependencies (4) is reasonable and does not indicate over-coupling that would necessitate modularization."
