    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 39 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and WMC of 0. It represents a simple compound pattern implementation with minimal responsibilities. The lack of methods and low LOC indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
