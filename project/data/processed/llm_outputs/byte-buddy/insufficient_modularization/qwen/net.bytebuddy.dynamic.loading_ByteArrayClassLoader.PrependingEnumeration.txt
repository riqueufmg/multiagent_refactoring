    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 44 lines of code (loc=44). It has minimal fields (nof=2) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
