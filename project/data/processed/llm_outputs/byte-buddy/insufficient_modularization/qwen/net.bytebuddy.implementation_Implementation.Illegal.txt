    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low LOC count (40). WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. The class appears to be a simple, minimal implementation with no signs of insufficient modularization as it lacks the complexity that would require further decomposition."
