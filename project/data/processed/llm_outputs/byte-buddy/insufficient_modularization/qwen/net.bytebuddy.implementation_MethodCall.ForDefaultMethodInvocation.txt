    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and weighted method count of 0 (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
