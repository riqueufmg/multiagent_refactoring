    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 12 lines of code (loc=12) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies except to its own dispatcher. The low size and complexity metrics indicate it is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
