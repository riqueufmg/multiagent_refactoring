    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.MethodHandleInfo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 35 lines of code (loc=35). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal complexity. While the class currently has limited functionality, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition. The negative LCOM value (-1.0) suggests good cohesion among existing elements. Given the minimal size and complexity, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that further modularization would provide benefits."
