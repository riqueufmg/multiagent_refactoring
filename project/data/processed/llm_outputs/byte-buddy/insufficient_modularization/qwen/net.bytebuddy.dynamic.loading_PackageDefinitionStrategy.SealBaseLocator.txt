    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 127 lines of code (loc=127). While the class has some fields, the low method count and relatively small size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
