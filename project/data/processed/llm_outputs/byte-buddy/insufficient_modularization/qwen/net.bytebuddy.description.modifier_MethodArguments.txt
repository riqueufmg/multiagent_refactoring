    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, indicating low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class is already well-encapsulated. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure suggests it is sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
