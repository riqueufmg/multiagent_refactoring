    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.DifferentialMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 47 lines of code (loc=47). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is a simple data class or interface rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The class appears to be properly decomposed given its minimal functionality."
