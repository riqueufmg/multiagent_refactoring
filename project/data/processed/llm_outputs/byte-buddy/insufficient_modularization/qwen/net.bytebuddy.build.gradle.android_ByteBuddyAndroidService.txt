    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 26 and LOC of 292, contains 10 fields and 5 methods where 4 methods are public, indicating significant implementation complexity that could benefit from further decomposition. The class manages multiple dependencies (14 external types) and appears to handle complex Android service functionality, suggesting it could be broken down into smaller, more focused components to reduce size and complexity."
