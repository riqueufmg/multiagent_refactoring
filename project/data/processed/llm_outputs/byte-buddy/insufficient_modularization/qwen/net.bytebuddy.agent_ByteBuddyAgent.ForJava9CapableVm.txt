    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.ForJava9CapableVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 36 lines of code (loc=36), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or configuration class rather than a complex module requiring refactoring."
