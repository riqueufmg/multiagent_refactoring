{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.CacheProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7), 0 methods (nom=0), and 251 lines of code (loc=251). While the LOC is relatively high for a class with no methods, the low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well-decomposed. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would suggest insufficient modularization."
