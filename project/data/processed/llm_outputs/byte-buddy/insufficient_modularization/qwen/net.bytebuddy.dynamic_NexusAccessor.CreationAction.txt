    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor.CreationAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and only 41 lines of code (loc=41). It has no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies on other classes from its own package. The absence of methods and low LOC indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
