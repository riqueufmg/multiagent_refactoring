    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeVariableToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 3 fields (nof=3), which is within reasonable limits for a well-modularized class. The weighted method count (wmc=12) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would suggest insufficient modularization. The lines of code (loc=91) are relatively low, suggesting the class is not overly large. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.2) further support that this is a well-contained, focused class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
