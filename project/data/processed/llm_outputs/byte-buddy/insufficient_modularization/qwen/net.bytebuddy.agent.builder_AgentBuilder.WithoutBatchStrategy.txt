    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 11 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 weighted method complexity. The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple marker or configuration class that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
