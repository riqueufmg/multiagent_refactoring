    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.WithFixedDelay",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 40 lines of code (loc=40). The lack of methods and low line count indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No other complexity metrics (nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0) suggest insufficient modularization issues."
