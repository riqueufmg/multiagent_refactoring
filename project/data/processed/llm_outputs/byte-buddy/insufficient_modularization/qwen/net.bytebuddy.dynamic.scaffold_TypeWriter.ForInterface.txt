    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForInterface",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). While the class has 122 lines of code (loc=122), this is not excessive for a specialized class. The lack of methods and simple dependency structure suggest it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
