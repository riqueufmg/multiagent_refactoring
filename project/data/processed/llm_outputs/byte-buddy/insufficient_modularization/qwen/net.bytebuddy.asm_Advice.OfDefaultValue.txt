    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 29 lines of code (loc). It has minimal dependencies on 4 external classes but no internal dependencies. The low method count and complexity metrics indicate proper modularization for this class's current scope."
