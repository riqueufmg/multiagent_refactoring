    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.CacheValueField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 59 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no public or private methods. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
