    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor.LocalVariableAwareMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 8 weighted method count (wmc=8), 34 lines of code (loc=34), and 1 field (nof=1). The LCOM value is 0.0 indicating good cohesion. The number of public methods (nopm=3) equals total methods, suggesting appropriate encapsulation. These metrics indicate sufficient modularization with no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would require further decomposition."
