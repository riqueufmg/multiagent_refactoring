    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and only 115 lines of code. The lack of methods and low LOC count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies suggest limited responsibility scope."
