    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Delegator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 fields (nof=17) and 378 lines of code (loc=378), indicating high size and complexity for a single class. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests it may be a data-only class that could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and improve modularity. The high field count combined with substantial LOC suggests insufficient modularization where the class could be broken down into smaller, more focused components."
