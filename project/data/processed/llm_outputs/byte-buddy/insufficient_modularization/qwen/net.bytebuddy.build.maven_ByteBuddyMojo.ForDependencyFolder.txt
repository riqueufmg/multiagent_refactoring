    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.ForDependencyFolder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 39 lines of code (loc=39). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex module requiring refactoring."
