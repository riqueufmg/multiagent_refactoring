    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeReferenceAdjustment.TypeReferenceFieldVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 22 lines of code (loc=22). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. There are no dependencies on other classes within the system (fanout=0) and no incoming dependencies (fanin=0). The class appears to be a simple, lightweight inner class with minimal responsibilities, suggesting it is already sufficiently modularized for its current scope and complexity."
