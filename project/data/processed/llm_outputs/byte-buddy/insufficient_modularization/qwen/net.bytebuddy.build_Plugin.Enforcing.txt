    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Enforcing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 78 lines of code which is relatively small, and all metrics (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0) indicate minimal complexity. The negative LCOM value suggests good cohesion. There are no dependencies, indicating simplicity. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, well-contained class."
