    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForWildcardBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 56 lines of code (loc), 5 fields (nof), 0 methods (nom), and 0 method invocations (wmc). The low number of methods and fields, combined with the relatively small size (56 loc), indicates that the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
