    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription.ForLoadedParameter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 fields (nof=15) and 407 lines of code (loc=407), indicating high size and complexity for a single class. The lack of methods (nom=0) and high field count suggests this class may be doing too much and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high number of dependencies (7) also indicates potential over-complexity and insufficient modularization."
