    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaInstrumentationStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 31 fields (nof=31) and 1105 lines of code (loc=1105), indicating high size and complexity. It also has a large number of dependencies (19 external types used) which suggests it handles multiple responsibilities. The lack of methods (nom=0) might indicate that the logic is embedded within anonymous classes or complex field initializations, contributing to insufficient modularization."
