    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.ArgumentTypeResolver.PrimitiveTypePrecedence",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), and 89 lines of code (loc=89). While the LOC is relatively high for a class with no methods, the low number of fields and methods indicates minimal complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. WMC of 0 and LCOM of -1.0 further support that this is not a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
