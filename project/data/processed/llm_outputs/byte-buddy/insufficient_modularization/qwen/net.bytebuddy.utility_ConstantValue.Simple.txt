    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 85 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and no inheritance depth (dit=1). While it has 2 fields, the low method count and minimal complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or constant container rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
