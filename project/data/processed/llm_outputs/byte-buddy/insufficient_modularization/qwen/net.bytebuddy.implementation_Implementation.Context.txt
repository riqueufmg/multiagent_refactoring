{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Context",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 38 fields (nof=38) and 1133 lines of code (loc=1133), indicating high size and complexity. It also has 19 dependencies (dependencies count=19) which suggests high coupling. The lack of methods (nom=0) combined with high field count suggests incomplete decomposition where related functionality should be extracted into separate classes. The high number of fields and dependencies without any methods indicates this class likely serves multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
