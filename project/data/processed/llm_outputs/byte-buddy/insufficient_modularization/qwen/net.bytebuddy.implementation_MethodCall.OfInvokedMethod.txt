    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.OfInvokedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 44 lines of code (loc). The low number of methods and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition is not necessary as the class is already sufficiently simple and small."
