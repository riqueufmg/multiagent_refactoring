    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a manageable size with 276 lines of code and 9 methods. The WMC of 42 indicates moderate complexity. With only 263 fields, the class is large but appears to be a generated benchmark test class following a specific pattern. The low LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion among methods. The class seems to serve a single, well-defined purpose as a JMH benchmark test, and there's no clear indication that further decomposition would significantly reduce complexity or improve maintainability."
