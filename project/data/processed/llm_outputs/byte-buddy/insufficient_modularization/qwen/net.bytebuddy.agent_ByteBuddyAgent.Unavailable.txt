{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.Unavailable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 31 lines of code (loc=31). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). This indicates a simple data class or marker class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The lack of methods and minimal size suggests it is already sufficiently modularized for its intended purpose."
