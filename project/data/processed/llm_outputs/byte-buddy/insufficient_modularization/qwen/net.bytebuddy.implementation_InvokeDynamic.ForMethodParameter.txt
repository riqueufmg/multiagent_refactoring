{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForMethodParameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 71 lines of code (loc=71). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on 4 other classes, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0) and low field count (nof=2) suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
