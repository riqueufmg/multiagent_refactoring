    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.EmulatingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 48 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no public or private methods. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest the class is already well-decomposed or serves a simple purpose. The LCOM value of -1.0 and zero fan-in/fan-out further indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
