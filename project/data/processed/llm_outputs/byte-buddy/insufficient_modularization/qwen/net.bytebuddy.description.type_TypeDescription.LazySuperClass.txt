    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=39 but this appears to be the file location rather than method count), and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0). With no methods or functionality to decompose, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already at a minimal decomposition level."
