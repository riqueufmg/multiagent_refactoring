    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.ClassWriterStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2) and 118 lines of code, which is relatively small. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public methods or fields, the class appears to be well-focused. The low number of methods and fields suggests it is already sufficiently decomposed for its current responsibilities."
