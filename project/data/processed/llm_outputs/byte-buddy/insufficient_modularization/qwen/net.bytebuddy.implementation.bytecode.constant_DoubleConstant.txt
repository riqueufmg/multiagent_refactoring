{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.DoubleConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 3 public), low complexity (WMC=6), and reasonable size (77 LOC). The LCOM value of 0.75 indicates some cohesion issues but given the small size and method count, further decomposition would likely not provide significant benefits. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
