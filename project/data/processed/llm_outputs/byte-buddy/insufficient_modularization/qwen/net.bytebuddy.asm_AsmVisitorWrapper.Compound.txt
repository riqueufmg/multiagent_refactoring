    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and minimal size (loc=58). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT=1 shows it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy. With no methods or significant functionality, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already at a minimal decomposition state."
