    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.TypeVariableDefinition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 165 lines of code which is not excessively large, but more importantly it has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely a data-only class or interface. The lack of complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) and inheritance depth (dit=0) suggest this is a simple structural element rather than a complex class that needs decomposition. Without behavioral complexity or implementation details, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization."
