    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer.Drain",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 46 lines of code (loc=46). The low number of methods and fields, combined with the relatively small size, does not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
