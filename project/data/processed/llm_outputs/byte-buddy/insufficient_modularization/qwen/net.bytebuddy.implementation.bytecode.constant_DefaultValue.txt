    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.DefaultValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 3 public), low lines of code (72), low weighted method count (9), and moderate dependencies (8). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates reasonable cohesion. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant classification as Insufficient Modularization given the relatively simple responsibility of handling default values for different types."
