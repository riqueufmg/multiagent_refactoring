    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.ToStringMethod.ValueConsumer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 309 lines of code (loc) which indicates high implementation complexity. With 0 methods (nom) and 0 fields (nof), the class appears to be a utility or helper class that could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more focused components. The high LOC combined with lack of method decomposition suggests insufficient modularization where the functionality could be better distributed into smaller, more manageable units."
