    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.AnnotatedWildcardType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal complexity. While it has a dependency on JavaDispatcher, the class itself is extremely simple and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization - it appears to be a well-decomposed, minimal interface or marker class."
