{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder.DelegationProcessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 10 fields (nof=10) and 210 lines of code (loc=210), indicating high complexity and insufficient decomposition. The nested class name 'DelegationProcessor' suggests it handles multiple responsibilities related to delegation processing, which could be further decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The high field count and substantial LOC suggest this class could benefit from modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
