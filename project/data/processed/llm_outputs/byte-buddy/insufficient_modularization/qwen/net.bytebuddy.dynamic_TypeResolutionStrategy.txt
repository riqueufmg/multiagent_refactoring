    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and reasonable size (loc=178). It has minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and contains only 3 fields. The low method count and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization despite the class having some lines of code."
