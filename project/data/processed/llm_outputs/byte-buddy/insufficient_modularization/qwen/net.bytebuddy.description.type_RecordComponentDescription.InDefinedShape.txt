    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription.InDefinedShape",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 30 lines of code (loc=30). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While it's an inner class (dit=2), its size and complexity are minimal, not warranting further decomposition. The lack of methods and low LOC suggest it's already sufficiently modularized for its current purpose."
