{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.ForDeclaredMethods",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 240 lines of code (loc) and 11 fields (nof), indicating substantial size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom: 0) suggests potential issues with decomposition where logic might be embedded within field initializers or nested structures rather than properly modularized methods. High line count combined with multiple fields and no declared methods indicates insufficient modularization where the class likely contains complex logic that should be decomposed into smaller, more manageable components."
