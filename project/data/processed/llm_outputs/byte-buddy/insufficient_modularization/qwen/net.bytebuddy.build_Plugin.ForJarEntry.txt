    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 40 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies to other classes beyond the parent. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class that is already sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
