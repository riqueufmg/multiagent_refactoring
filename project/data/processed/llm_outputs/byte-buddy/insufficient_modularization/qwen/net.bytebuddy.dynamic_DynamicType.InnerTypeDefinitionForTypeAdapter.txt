    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 31 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 method invocations. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and the LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple data holder or adapter with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
