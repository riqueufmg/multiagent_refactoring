    "justification": "The class has 81 lines of code but all metrics show minimal complexity (WMC=0, NOF=0, NOPF=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, NC=0, DIT=0). The lack of methods, fields, and complexity metrics indicate this is likely a simple data class or value object rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. No evidence of high complexity or large size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
