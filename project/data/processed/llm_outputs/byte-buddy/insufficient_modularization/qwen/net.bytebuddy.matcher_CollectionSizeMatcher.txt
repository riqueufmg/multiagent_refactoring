    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 1 field (nof=1), and low complexity (wmc=5, loc=35). The LCOM value is 0.0 indicating good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused matcher implementation with minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
