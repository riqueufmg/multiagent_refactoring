    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.MethodStrictness",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5), low lines of code (46), and low weighted method count (5), indicating it is already well modularized. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies suggests it has clear boundaries. The LCOM value of 0.8 indicates good cohesion within the class."
