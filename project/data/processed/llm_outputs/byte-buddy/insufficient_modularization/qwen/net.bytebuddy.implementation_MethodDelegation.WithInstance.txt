    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.WithInstance",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 41 lines of code (loc=41), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. There are no public fields (nopf=0) or public methods (nopm=0) to suggest interface bloat. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
