    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 44 lines of code (loc=44). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicates this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class that is already sufficiently modularized for its intended purpose."
