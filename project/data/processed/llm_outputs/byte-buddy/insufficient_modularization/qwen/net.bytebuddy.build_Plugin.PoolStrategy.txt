{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.PoolStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 65 lines of code (loc=65). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependency on net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
