    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithoutExitAdvice",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low lines of code (loc=54). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused component with minimal responsibilities, indicating sufficient modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
