    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList.Generic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 25 fields (nof=25) and 669 lines of code (loc=669), indicating high size and complexity. With 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), the class appears to be a data-heavy structure that lacks proper decomposition into smaller, more manageable components. The high field count combined with substantial LOC suggests insufficient modularization where the class could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more focused modules."
