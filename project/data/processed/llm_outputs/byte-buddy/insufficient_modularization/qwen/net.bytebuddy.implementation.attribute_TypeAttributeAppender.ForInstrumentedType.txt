```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.TypeAttributeAppender.ForInstrumentedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 76 lines of code (loc=76), and depth of inheritance of 1 (dit=1). The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. While the class has some dependencies (4 fanout), the low internal complexity and small size do not indicate insufficient modularization."
