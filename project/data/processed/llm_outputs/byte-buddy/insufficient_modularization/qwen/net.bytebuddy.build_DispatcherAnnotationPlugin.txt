{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.DispatcherAnnotationPlugin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 6 public), low lines of code (44), low weighted method count (7), and no fields. The lack of complexity indicators such as high method count, high cyclomatic complexity, or numerous dependencies suggests that further decomposition is not warranted. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current responsibilities."
