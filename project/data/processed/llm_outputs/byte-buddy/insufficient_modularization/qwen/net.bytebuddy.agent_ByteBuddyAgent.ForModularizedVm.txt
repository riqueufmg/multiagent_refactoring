    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 13 lines of code, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), and no dependencies. The metrics indicate this is a minimal or possibly empty class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of complex functionality that would benefit from further decomposition."
