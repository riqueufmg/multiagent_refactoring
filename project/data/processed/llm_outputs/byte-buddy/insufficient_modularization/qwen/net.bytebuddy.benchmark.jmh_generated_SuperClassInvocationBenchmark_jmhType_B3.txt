    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 18 lines of code, 0 methods, and 256 fields which suggests it is a data-only class likely generated for benchmarking purposes. While the high number of fields (256) might seem concerning, the class has very low complexity (WMC=0, NOM=0) and appears to be a specialized generated class rather than a case of insufficient modularization. The class seems to serve a single focused purpose as indicated by its low structural complexity."
