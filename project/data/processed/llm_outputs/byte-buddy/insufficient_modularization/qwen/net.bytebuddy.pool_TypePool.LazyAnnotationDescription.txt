{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyAnnotationDescription",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 135 lines of code (loc=135). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low number of fields and methods suggests the class is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) indicates this is likely a data-only class or placeholder, not exhibiting complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. The WMC of 0 further confirms minimal complexity."
