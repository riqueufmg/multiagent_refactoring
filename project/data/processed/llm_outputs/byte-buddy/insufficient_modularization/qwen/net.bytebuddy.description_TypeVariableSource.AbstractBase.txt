{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 33 lines of code (loc=33). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While it has dependencies on 3 other classes, the class itself is minimal in size and complexity, representing a proper abstract base class that delegates functionality to subclasses rather than containing insufficiently decomposed logic."
