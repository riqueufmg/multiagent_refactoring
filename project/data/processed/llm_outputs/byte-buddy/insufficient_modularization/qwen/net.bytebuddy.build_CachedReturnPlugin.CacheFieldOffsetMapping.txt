    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 22 lines of code (loc). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof) and no method parameters (nopm). The lack of methods and low complexity indicates proper modularization for this specific component."
