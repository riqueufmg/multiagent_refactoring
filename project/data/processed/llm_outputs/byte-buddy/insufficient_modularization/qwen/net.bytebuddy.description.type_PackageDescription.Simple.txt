    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 28 lines of code (loc=28), and minimal dependencies (only depends on AnnotationList). The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
