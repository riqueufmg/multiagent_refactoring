    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.ForOpenJ9",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 30 fields and 1121 lines of code, indicating high size and complexity. With 6 public fields and no methods, the class appears to be a data-heavy class that lacks proper decomposition. The high number of fields suggests that this class could benefit from further modularization by extracting related fields into separate classes or components."
