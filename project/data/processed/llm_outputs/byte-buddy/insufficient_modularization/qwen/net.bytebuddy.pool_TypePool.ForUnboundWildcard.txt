    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForUnboundWildcard",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 71 lines of code (loc=71). It has minimal fields (nof=3) and no public fields (nopf=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
