    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 22 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and a WMC of 0. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class with minimal responsibilities. Given its small size and low complexity, it does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it would not benefit from further decomposition."
