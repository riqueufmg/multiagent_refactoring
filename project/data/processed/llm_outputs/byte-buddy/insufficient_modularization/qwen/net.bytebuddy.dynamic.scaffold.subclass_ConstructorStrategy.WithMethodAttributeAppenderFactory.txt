    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 34 lines of code, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=2 but nopf=0), and minimal dependencies (3 external dependencies). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple, well-contained component with appropriate modularization for its functionality."
