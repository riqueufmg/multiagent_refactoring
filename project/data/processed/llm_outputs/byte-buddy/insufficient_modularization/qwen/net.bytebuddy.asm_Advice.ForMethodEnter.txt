    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForMethodEnter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 1 field (nof). The lines of code (122) are relatively moderate for a class with minimal functionality. There are no dependencies on other classes within the same package, and the lack of methods suggests it may be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
