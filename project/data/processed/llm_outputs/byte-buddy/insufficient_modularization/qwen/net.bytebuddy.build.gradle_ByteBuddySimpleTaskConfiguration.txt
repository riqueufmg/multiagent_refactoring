    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddySimpleTaskConfiguration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (1 public), 49 lines of code, and a low weighted method count of 3. The lack of fields (0) and low LCOM value (1.0) indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple configuration class with minimal responsibilities, making it appropriately modularized for its current scope."
