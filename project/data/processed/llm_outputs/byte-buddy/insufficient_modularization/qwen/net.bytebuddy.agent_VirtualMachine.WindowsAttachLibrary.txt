    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is an empty or minimal class that does not exhibit complexity requiring further decomposition. With only 22 lines of code (loc=22) and no internal structure (wmc=0, nc=0), there is insufficient complexity to warrant modularization concerns."
