    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForThisReference",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 111 lines of code (loc=111). While the class has some complexity due to its dependencies on 6 external classes and 111 lines of code, the low number of fields and absence of methods suggests it may already be sufficiently decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0) indicate this is likely a data class or simple container rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
