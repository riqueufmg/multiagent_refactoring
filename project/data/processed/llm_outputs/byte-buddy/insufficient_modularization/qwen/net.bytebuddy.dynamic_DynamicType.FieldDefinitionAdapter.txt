    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.FieldDefinitionAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=39 but this appears to be file-level not class-level), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). With no methods or significant functionality, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class does not exhibit the complexity that would require further decomposition."
