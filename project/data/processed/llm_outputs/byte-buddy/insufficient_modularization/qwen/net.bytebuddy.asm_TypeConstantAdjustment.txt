    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeConstantAdjustment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (3 total, 3 public), low lines of code (84), low weighted method count (3), and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The lack of complexity and dependencies indicates sufficient modularization has been achieved."
