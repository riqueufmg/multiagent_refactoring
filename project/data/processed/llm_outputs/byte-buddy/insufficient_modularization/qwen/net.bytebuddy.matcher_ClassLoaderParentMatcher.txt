{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ClassLoaderParentMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with all being public (nopm=3), 1 field (nof=1), and 33 lines of code (loc=33). The weighted method count (wmc=5) indicates low complexity. The lack of class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) and low LCOM value (0.0) suggest good cohesion. These metrics indicate a well-modularized, simple class that does not require further decomposition."
