    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.IntegerConstant.ConstantPool",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 23 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and no fields (nof=1). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or constant holder rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
