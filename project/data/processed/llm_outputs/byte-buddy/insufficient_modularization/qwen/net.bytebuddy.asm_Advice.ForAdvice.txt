    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 154 lines of code (loc=154). While the class has some fields, the low method count and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a data-only class or a simple configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
