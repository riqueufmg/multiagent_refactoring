{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForMethodExit",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 125 lines of code (loc=125) which indicates high implementation complexity, and it has 6 dependencies on other classes suggesting it may be doing too much work. The class appears to be a nested class (ForMethodExit) within Advice, and its high line count and multiple dependencies suggest it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
