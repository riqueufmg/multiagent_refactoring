    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForShortConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 28 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 weighted method count. The low size and complexity metrics indicate sufficient modularization. While it has 3 dependencies, this is not excessive for a class of this size and does not indicate insufficient decomposition."
