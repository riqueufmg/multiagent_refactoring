    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lines of code (loc=18) are minimal and the class serves as a simple no-operation implementation. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly cohesive and simple."
