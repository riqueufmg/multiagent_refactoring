    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 155 lines of code (loc=155). While the class has a moderate number of fields and dependencies (7 external dependencies), the lack of methods indicates it may be a data-only class or interface implementation. The low method count and absence of complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) suggest this class is not overly complex in terms of behavior. The size (155 loc) is not excessively large for a class with its responsibilities, and without method complexity data, there's insufficient evidence to conclude it suffers from insufficient modularization."
