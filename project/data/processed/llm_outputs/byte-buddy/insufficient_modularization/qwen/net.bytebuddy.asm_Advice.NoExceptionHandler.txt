    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.NoExceptionHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=0), and only 19 lines of code (loc=19). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With such low size and complexity, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
