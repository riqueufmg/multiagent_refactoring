    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 14 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0). The lack of methods and low LOC indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or reference type with no implementation complexity that would benefit from modularization."
