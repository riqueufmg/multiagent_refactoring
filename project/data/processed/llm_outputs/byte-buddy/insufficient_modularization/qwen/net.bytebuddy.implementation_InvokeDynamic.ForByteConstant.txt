    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForByteConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 28 lines of code (loc). It has minimal dependencies on only 3 external classes and no internal fields (nof) or parameters (nopf). The low size and complexity metrics indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
