    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 33 fields and 776 lines of code, indicating high implementation complexity and size. It also has 23 dependencies, suggesting high responsibility and lack of clear separation of concerns. With only 3 methods and a WMC of 3, the complexity is concentrated in few methods, likely making them overly complex. The class lacks proper decomposition, violating the principle of Insufficient Modularization."
