    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.ForValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields (nof=4), 0 private fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 0 private methods (nopm=0). The lines of code (loc=77) are relatively small, weighted method count (wmc=0) indicates low complexity, and lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests simple functionality. The depth of inheritance (dit=2) is minimal. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, its current size and complexity are not sufficient to warrant classification as Insufficient Modularization."
