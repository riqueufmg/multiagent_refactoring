```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.TransformerDecorator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 77 lines of code (loc=77), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed. While the class has 77 lines of code, this is not excessive for a class with minimal functionality. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics suggest the class is sufficiently modularized for its current responsibilities."
