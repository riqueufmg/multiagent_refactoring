    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.Dynamic",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0, loc=408) and no inheritance depth issues (dit=2). While the class has multiple dependencies (7), the lack of methods and low weighted method count suggest it may be a data-only class rather than suffering from insufficient modularization. The LOC count alone is not sufficient evidence for insufficient modularization without corresponding method complexity."
