    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), and only 22 lines of code (loc). The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. With only 1 field (nof) and no public fields (nopf), the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
