    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.FieldGetter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 79 lines of code (loc=79). While the class has dependencies on 7 other classes, the low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well-decomposed. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) suggests this is likely a data class or simple structure rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
