    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=29 but this appears to be the file loc, not class loc), and WMC=0. The class appears to be a simple data holder or utility class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. With only 1 field and no methods, there is insufficient complexity to warrant modularization concerns."
