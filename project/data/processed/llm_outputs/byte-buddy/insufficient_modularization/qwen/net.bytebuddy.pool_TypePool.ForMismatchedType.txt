    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForMismatchedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 54 lines of code (loc=54). It has minimal functionality with only 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and no class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The low method count and complexity metrics indicate this class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
