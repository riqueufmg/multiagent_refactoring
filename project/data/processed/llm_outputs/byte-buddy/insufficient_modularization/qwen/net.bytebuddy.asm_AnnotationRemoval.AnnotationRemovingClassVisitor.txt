    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 106 lines of code which is moderate in size, contains 7 fields with no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), and has a WMC of 0 indicating minimal complexity. While the class could potentially benefit from further decomposition, the metrics do not clearly indicate insufficient modularization as the complexity remains low despite the LOC count."
