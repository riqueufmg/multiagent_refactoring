{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.OwnerTypeLocatable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 23 lines of code (loc=23). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. While it has dependencies on FieldLocator, the class itself is already highly decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it contains minimal functionality to decompose further."
