    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=102 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). With no methods to decompose and minimal structural complexity, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization."
