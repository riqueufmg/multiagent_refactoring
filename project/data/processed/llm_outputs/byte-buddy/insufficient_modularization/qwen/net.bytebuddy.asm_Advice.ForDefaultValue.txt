{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForDefaultValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 private fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 92 lines of code. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating no method complexity. While the class is nested (indicated by the dot in the name), its size and complexity metrics are minimal and do not indicate insufficient modularization. The low LOC and absence of methods suggest this is a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
