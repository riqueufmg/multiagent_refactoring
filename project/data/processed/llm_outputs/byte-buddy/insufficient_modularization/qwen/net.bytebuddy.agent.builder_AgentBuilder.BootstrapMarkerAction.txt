    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 13 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and WMC of 0. The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple marker or configuration class rather than a complex entity requiring modularization."
