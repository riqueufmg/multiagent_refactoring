    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 19 lines of code (loc=19), and no fields (nof=0). It also has a simple dependency relationship with only 1 dependency. The low complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
