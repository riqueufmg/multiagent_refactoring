    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.WithUnknownConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 92 lines of code (loc=92). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and simple field count indicate this is a lightweight data structure rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The class appears to be a nested static class serving a specific purpose with minimal complexity."
