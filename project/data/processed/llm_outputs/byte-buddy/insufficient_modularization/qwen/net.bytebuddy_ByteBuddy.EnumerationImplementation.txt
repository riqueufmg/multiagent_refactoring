{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy.EnumerationImplementation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 8 fields but no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it may be a data-only class or incomplete implementation. With only 112 lines of code and no method complexity (wmc=0), the class does not exhibit high complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The lack of methods suggests this is likely a simple data structure rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
