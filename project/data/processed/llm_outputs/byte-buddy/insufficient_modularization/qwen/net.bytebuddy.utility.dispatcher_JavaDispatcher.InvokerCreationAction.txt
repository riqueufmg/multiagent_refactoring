    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.InvokerCreationAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond the HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin annotation. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its minimal size and complexity."
