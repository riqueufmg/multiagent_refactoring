    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyJarTask",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods with 105 lines of code, which is within reasonable limits for a Gradle task implementation. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 15, indicating low complexity. The LCOM value of 0.2857142857142857 suggests good cohesion within the class. With only 4 fields and no inheritance (DIT=1), the class is relatively simple and focused on its task. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
