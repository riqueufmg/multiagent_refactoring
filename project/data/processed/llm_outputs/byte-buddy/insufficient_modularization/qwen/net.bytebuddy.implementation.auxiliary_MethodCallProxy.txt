    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.MethodCallProxy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=6) and lines of code (loc=279) with a relatively high weighted method count (wmc=9), indicating potential complexity. It also has multiple inner classes and dependencies (19 external dependencies), suggesting that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
