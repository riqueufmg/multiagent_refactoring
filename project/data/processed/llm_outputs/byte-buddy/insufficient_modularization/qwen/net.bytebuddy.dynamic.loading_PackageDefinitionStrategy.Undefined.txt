    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely an empty or marker class. With minimal functionality and no complex internal structure, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already at its simplest form."
