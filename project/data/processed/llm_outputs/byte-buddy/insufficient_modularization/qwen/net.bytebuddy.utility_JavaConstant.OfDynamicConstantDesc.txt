{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.OfDynamicConstantDesc",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 38 lines of code (loc=38). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal complexity. While the class depends on JavaDispatcher, the metrics indicate this is a simple, lightweight class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
