    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 28 lines of code (loc). With minimal functionality and low complexity, there is no indication that further decomposition would provide benefits. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple nature."
