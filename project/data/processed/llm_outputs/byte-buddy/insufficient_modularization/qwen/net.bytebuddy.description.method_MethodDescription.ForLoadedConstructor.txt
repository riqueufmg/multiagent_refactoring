    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription.ForLoadedConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 114 lines of code which is not excessively large, but more importantly, the metrics show 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0) which suggests this class may be a nested or inner class with limited functionality. Without sufficient metric data to indicate high complexity or large size that would warrant further decomposition, and considering the class appears to be a specialized constructor representation within the MethodDescription hierarchy, there is insufficient evidence to detect Insufficient Modularization."
