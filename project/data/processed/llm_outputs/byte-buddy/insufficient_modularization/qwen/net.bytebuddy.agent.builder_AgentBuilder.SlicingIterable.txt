    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), with a low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0). The lines of code (loc=106) are reasonably distributed for a class with this metric profile. There is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
