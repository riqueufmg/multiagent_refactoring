```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.RecordComponentTokenList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond the basic record component descriptions. This indicates a highly simplified class that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization, which typically involves classes that are overly complex and could benefit from decomposition."
