    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 39 lines of code, 2 fields, 0 methods, and 0 weighted method count. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
