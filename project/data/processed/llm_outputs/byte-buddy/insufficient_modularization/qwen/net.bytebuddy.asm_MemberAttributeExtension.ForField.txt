    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension.ForField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (wmc: 0, nom: 0, loc: 114) and minimal dependencies (3 fields, 0 public fields, 0 methods, 0 public methods). While the LOC is moderately high at 114, the lack of methods and low complexity metrics suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
