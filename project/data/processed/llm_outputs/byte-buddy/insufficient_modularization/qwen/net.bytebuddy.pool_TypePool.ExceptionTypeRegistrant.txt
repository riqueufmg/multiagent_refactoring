{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ExceptionTypeRegistrant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class may be a candidate for decomposition based on its nested nature, its extremely small size and low complexity do not constitute insufficient modularization as it does not contain significant functionality that needs further decomposition."
