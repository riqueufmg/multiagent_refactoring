    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 5 fields (nof=5), with 94 lines of code (loc=94). The weighted method count (wmc=8) indicates low complexity. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure suggest adequate modularization for its current size and complexity."
