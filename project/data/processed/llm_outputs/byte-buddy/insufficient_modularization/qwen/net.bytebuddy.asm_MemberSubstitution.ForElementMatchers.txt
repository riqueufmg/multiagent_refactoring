    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForElementMatchers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 fields (nof=14) and 159 lines of code (loc=159), which indicates a moderate size. However, it has 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), suggesting it may be primarily a data holder or configuration class rather than a complex behavioral class. The lack of methods makes it difficult to assess behavioral complexity, but the relatively low number of fields and moderate LOC do not clearly indicate insufficient modularization. Without evidence of high complexity or clear decomposition opportunities, insufficient modularization cannot be confidently detected."
