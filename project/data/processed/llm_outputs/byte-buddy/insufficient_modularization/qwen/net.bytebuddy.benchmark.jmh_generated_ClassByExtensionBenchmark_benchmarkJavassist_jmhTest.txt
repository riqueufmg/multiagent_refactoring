    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 263 fields (nof=263) and 276 lines of code (loc=276), indicating excessive size and complexity for a single class. The high number of fields suggests that the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more manageable modules. Additionally, the class has 9 methods (nom=9) with a weighted method count of 42 (wmc=42), further indicating implementation complexity that could be reduced through better modularization."
