    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Unresolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=22 but this appears to be the file location rather than actual code lines), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and complexity indicates insufficient material to warrant further decomposition, making it appropriately modularized for its current functionality."
