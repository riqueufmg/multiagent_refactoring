{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 33 fields (nof=33) and 792 lines of code (loc=792), indicating high size and potential complexity. It also has 19 dependencies, suggesting high coupling with other classes. These metrics suggest that the class may not be sufficiently decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and complexity."
