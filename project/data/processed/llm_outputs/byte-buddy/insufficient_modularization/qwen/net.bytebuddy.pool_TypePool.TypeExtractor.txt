    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 72 fields (nof=72) and 712 lines of code (loc=712), indicating excessive size and complexity for a single class. The high number of fields suggests multiple responsibilities and data that could be decomposed into separate classes. With no methods (nom=0) but 72 fields, this class appears to be a data-heavy structure that has not been properly decomposed, representing a clear case of Insufficient Modularization where further decomposition could reduce its size and implementation complexity."
