    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMatchedByteCodeElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 28 lines of code (loc=28). It has minimal dependencies with 0 fan-in and 0 fan-out. The low number of methods and low complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
