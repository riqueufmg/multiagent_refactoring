    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.CreateClassVisitorFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 202 lines of code. While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the lack of methods and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0) indicate this is likely a data-only class or simple factory component rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further modularization."
