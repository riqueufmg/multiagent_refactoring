{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodRebaseResolver.ForRebasedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 126 lines of code (loc=126). While the LOC is moderately high for a class with no methods, the low number of fields and absence of methods suggests this is likely a data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from modularization."
