    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=41 but this appears to be the file loc not class loc), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The class appears to be a simple data structure or value object with only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0). The low complexity metrics indicate sufficient modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
