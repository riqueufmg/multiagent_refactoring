    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingInstrumentation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 241 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has 8 fields (nof) and 5 dependencies, suggesting it has multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further modularization to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
