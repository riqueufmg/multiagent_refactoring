    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 22 lines of code, 1 field, and 0 methods. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal complexity. While it has dependencies on 2 external classes, the class itself is already sufficiently decomposed given its small size and low complexity. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized and structured."
