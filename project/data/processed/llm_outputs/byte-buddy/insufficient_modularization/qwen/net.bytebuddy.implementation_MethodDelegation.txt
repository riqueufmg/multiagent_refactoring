    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 37 fields and 31 methods with a total of 1134 lines of code, indicating high complexity and size. The lack of decomposition is evident from the high number of responsibilities likely handled by this single class, suggesting it could benefit from further modularization to reduce its implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
