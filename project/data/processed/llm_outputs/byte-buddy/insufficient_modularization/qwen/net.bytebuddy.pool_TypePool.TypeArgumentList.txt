{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.TypeArgumentList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 74 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal method complexity. While it has one dependency on TypeList, the low internal complexity and minimal interface suggest it is appropriately modularized for its current functionality."
