    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForUnresolvedProperty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 18 lines of code (loc=18). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods or fields to decompose, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already at a minimal complexity level."
