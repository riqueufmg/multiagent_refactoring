    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.ForJavaMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and 43 lines of code (loc=43). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond MethodDescription. The class appears to be a simple data structure or value object rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
