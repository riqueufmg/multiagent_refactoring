    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Inversion",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 22 lines of code (loc=22), and minimal dependencies. The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further modularization."
