    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyRecordComponentDescription",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields and 0 methods, with 73 lines of code. While the class has some complexity due to its nested nature (being an inner class), the low number of fields and methods suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0) and low field count (nof=6) indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
