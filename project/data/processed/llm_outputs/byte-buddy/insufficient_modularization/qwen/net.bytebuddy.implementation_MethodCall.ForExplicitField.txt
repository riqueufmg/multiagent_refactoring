    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForExplicitField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 22 lines of code (loc). It has minimal fields (1) and no dependencies on other classes beyond basic descriptions. The low metric values indicate proper modularization rather than insufficient decomposition."
