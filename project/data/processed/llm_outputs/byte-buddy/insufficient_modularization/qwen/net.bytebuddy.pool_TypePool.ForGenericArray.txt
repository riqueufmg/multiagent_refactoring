    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 86 lines of code (loc=86). While the class has some fields, the low method count and relatively small size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a specialized, lightweight component with focused responsibility."
