    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 18 lines of code, 0 methods, and 256 fields which suggests it is a data-only class likely generated for benchmarking purposes. While the high number of fields (256) might seem concerning, the class has minimal complexity (WMC=0, NOM=0) and appears to serve a specific singular purpose as indicated by its benchmark-related naming convention. The low complexity metrics and single responsibility pattern do not indicate insufficient modularization."
