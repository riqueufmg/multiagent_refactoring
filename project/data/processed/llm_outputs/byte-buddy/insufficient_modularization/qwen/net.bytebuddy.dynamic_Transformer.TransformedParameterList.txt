{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.TransformedParameterList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and fan-in/fan-out are both 0, indicating minimal functionality. Given the extremely low size and complexity metrics, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed and minimal in scope."
