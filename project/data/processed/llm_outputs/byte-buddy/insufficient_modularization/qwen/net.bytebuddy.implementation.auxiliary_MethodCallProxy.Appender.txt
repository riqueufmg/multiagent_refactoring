    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.MethodCallProxy.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 28 lines of code (loc=28). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof=1) and no parameters. The low metric values indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
