    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5), 4 fields (nof=4), and 64 lines of code (loc=64). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity metrics (lcom=0.0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), indicates the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
