    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Loader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and minimal size with only 206 lines of code. The lack of methods and low LOC count indicates it is already well-decomposed or represents a simple data structure rather than a complex class that needs further modularization."
