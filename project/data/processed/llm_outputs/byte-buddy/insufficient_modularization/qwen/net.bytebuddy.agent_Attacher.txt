{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.Attacher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 1 public method (nopm=1), and low weighted method count (wmc=6). The lines of code (loc=72) are reasonable for a class of this complexity. LCOM value of 0.667 indicates moderate cohesion which is acceptable. The class has no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies, suggesting it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
