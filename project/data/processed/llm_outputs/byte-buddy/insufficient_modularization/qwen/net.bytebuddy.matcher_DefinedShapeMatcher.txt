    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with low complexity (wmc=3), 27 lines of code (loc=27), and only 1 field (nof=1). The low number of methods, low cyclomatic complexity, and small size indicate sufficient modularization. There are no signs of incomplete decomposition or excessive complexity that would warrant further breakdown."
