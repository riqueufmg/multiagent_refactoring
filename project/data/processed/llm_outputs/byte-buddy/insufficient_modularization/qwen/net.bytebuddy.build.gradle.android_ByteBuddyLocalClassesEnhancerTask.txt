    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18) with 17 of them being public (nopm=17), and a high Weighted Method Count (wmc=25), indicating high implementation complexity. The class also has 313 lines of code (loc=313) which is substantial. With 6 fields (nof=6) and multiple external dependencies (5 dependencies listed), this class appears to have too many responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and complexity."
