    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Discriminating",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 51 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no public methods or fields suggesting a simple data structure rather than a complex class requiring decomposition. The low fan-in and fan-out values indicate minimal dependencies, and the LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple, well-modularized component."
