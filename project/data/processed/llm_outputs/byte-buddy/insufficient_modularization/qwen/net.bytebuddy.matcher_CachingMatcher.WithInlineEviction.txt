    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.CachingMatcher.WithInlineEviction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0). With only 31 lines of code and no structural complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already minimally sized and does not require further decomposition."
