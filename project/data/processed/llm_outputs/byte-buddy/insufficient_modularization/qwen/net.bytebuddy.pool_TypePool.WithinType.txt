    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.WithinType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=46 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of fields (nof=2) and no dependencies on other classes within the provided data suggest it is already well-decomposed. There is insufficient evidence of complexity or size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
