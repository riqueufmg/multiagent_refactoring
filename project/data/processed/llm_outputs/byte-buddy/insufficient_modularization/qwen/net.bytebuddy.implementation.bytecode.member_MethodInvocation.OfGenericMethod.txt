    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation.OfGenericMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 67 lines of code. The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) is 0, indicating minimal behavioral complexity. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
