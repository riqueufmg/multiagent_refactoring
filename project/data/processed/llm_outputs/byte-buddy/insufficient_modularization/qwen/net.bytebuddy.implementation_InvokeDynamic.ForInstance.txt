    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 56 lines of code (loc=56). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and low complexity metrics indicate this is a simple data class or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The class does not exhibit characteristics of insufficient modularization as it appears to be appropriately sized and structured."
