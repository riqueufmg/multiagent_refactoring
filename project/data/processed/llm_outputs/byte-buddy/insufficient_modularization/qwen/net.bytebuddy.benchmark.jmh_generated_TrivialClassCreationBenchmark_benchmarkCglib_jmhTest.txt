    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a moderate size with 275 lines of code and 263 fields, but only 9 methods with low complexity (WMC=42). The low number of methods relative to fields and lines of code, combined with zero dependencies and low coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0, LCOM=0.0), suggests this is likely a data-heavy but behavior-light class, possibly auto-generated, rather than a case of insufficient modularization where decomposition would be beneficial."
