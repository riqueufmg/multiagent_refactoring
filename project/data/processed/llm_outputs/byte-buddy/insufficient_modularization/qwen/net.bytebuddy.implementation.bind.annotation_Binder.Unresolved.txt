    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.Unresolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 25 lines of code (loc=25). It has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no direct dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The lack of methods and minimal size indicates it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
