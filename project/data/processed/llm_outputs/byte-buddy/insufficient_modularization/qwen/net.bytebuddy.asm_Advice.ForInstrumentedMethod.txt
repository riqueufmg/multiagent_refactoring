{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForInstrumentedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 37 lines of code and all metrics indicating minimal size and complexity (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The low LOC and absence of methods, fields, and complex dependencies indicate this is likely a small, focused class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
