{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 108 lines of code (loc=108). While the LOC is relatively high for a class with no methods, the low number of fields and absence of any methods suggests this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further modularization."
