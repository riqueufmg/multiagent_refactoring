    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition.SuperClassIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 42 lines of code (loc=42). It also has minimal dependencies with only 1 field (nof=1) and no fan-in or fan-out dependencies. The low complexity metrics indicate proper modularization without need for further decomposition."
