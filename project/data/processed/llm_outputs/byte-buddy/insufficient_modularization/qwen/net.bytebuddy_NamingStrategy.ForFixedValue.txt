    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple, lightweight inner class that is already sufficiently decomposed given its minimal functionality. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already small and simple."
