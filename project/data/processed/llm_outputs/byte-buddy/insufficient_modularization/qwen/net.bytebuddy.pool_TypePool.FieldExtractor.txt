    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.FieldExtractor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields and 0 methods, with 61 lines of code. While the LOC count is moderate, the low number of fields and methods indicates reasonable size. There are no complex metrics (WMC=0, NC=0) suggesting low complexity. The single dependency on OpenedClassReader suggests focused responsibility. The class appears to be a simple data structure or value object rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
