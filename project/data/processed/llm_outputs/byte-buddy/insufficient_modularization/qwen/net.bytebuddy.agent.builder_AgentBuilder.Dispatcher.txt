    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (loc=18, wmc=0, nof=0, nom=0) and no internal dependencies, indicating it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The low lines of code and absence of methods suggest this is likely an interface or very simple class that does not require further decomposition."
