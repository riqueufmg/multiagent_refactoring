    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 73 lines of code (loc=73). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low complexity indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or value object with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
