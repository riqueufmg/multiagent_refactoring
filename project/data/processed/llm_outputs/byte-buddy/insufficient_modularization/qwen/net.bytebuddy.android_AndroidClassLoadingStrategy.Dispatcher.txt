    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with 105 lines of code. While the LOC is relatively high for the number of fields, the lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) indicate this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The absence of any dependencies and low fan-in/fan-out also suggests minimal complexity that would benefit from modularization."
