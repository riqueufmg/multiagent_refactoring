    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 34 lines of code (loc=34). It has minimal functionality with only 1 field (nof=1, nopf=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low size and complexity indicate sufficient modularization for its current purpose."
