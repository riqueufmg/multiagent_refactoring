    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 3 fields (nof=3), and 175 lines of code. The low number of methods and fields, combined with moderate LOC, indicates sufficient modularization. No excessive complexity or size issues are present that would warrant further decomposition."
