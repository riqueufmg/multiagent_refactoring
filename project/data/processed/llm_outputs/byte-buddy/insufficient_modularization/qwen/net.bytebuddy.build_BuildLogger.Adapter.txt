    "justification": "The class has 69 lines of code which is relatively small, has 0 methods (nom=0) indicating it may be a simple data class or interface implementation, and shows no signs of high complexity or lack of cohesion. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, LCOM is -1.0 (indicating good cohesion or simple structure), and there are no dependencies. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple nature."
