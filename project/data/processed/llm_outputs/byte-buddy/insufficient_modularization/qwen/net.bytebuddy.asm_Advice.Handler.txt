{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Handler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0, nc=0) and only 75 lines of code. While it has 2 fields and depends on 10 external classes, the low internal complexity and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple handler implementation that is appropriately decomposed."
