    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy.ManifestReading",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 fields (nof=10), 0 methods (nom=0), and 196 lines of code (loc=196). While the LOC is moderately high, the lack of methods (nom=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) indicate this class is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The single level of inheritance (dit=1) and no coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest minimal complexity that would benefit from modularization."
