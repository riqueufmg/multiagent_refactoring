    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType.Frozen",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 322 lines of code. The lack of methods (nopm=0, nopf=0, wmc=0) indicates it's likely a data class or simple container. The metrics do not indicate high complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
