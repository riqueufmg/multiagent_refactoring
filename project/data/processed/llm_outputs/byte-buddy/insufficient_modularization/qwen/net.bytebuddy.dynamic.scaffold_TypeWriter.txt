{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 150 fields (nof=150) and 4701 lines of code (loc=4701), with only 2 methods (nom=2), indicating a high level of complexity and insufficient decomposition. The large number of dependencies (60+ internal and external dependencies) suggests that this class is handling too many responsibilities and could benefit from further modularization into smaller, more focused classes."
