    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 21 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 weighted method count. The class appears to be a simple adapter implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
