    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), low lines of code (loc=57), and no inheritance depth (dit=0). The lack of methods and low complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
