    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal lines of code (loc=45), and no internal dependencies (wmc=0, nc=0). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate it is already sufficiently decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
