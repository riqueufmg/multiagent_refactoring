    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForSignatureVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 137 lines of code (loc=137). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is likely a simple data holder or visitor pattern implementation rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The class does not exhibit high complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
