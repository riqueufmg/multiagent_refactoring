    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.ReferenceTypeAwareAssigner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 24 lines of code (loc=24), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 3 dependencies and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), this class appears to be well-focused and adequately modularized for its size and complexity."
