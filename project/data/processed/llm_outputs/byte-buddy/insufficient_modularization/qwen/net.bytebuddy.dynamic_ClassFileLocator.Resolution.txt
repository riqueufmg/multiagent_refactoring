    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 71 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies or coupling metrics that suggest insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or value object with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
