    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.RebaseDynamicTypeBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 1 field (nof=1), with a low weighted method count (wmc=4), indicating low complexity. The lines of code (loc=72) are relatively small, and there are no signs of excessive responsibilities or complexity that would suggest insufficient modularization. The lack of fanin and fanout suggests limited interaction, which is consistent with a well-scoped class."
