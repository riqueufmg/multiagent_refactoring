    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 25 lines of code (loc=25). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods to decompose and low structural complexity, there is insufficient evidence of incomplete decomposition or need for further modularization."
