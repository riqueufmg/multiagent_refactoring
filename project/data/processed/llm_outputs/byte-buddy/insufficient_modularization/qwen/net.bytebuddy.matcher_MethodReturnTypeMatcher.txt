    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.MethodReturnTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 26 lines of code (loc=26), which indicates a small and focused implementation. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 0 package dependencies (nopf=0), the class maintains a simple structure. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate proper separation of concerns. The class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
