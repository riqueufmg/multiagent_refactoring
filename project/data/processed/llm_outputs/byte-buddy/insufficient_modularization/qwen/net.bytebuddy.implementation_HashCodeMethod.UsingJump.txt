    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.UsingJump",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 67 lines of code (loc=67). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal behavioral complexity. While the class uses jump-based logic which could potentially be decomposed, the current size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization given its limited scope and functionality."
