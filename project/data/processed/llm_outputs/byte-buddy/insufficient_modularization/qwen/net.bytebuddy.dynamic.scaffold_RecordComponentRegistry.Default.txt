    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.RecordComponentRegistry.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 fields (nof=9) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 171 lines of code (loc=171). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and simple structure (dit=1, wmc=0) indicate it's likely a data-only class or simple configuration class rather than a complex class needing decomposition. The absence of methods (nopm=0, nom=0) suggests it's not a behaviorally complex class that would benefit from further modularization."
