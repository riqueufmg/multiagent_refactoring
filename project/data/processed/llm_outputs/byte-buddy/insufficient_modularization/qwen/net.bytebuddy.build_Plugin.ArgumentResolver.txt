    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ArgumentResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 fields (nof=8) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 229 lines of code (loc=229). While the class has a relatively high number of lines of code, the low number of fields and methods suggests it is already well-decomposed. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
