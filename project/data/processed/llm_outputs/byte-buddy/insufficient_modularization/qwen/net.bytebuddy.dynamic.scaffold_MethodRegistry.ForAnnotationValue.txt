    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 34 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 weighted method complexity. The low number of fields (1) and methods (0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, focused component with limited responsibilities."
