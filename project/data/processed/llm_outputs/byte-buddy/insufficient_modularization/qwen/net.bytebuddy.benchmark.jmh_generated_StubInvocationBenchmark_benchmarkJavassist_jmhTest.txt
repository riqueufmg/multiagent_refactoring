    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkJavassist_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a reasonable size with 276 lines of code and 263 fields, but the low number of methods (9 total, 8 public) and low weighted method count (42) indicate it's not overly complex. The lack of class hierarchy (DIT=0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it's a simple, focused class likely generated for benchmarking purposes rather than a case of insufficient modularization."
