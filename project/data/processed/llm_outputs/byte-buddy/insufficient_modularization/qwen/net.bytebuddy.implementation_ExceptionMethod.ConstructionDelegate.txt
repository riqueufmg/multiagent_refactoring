    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.ExceptionMethod.ConstructionDelegate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 70 lines of code (loc=70). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on 5 external classes and 70 lines of code, the low number of fields and absence of methods suggest it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) indicate minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
