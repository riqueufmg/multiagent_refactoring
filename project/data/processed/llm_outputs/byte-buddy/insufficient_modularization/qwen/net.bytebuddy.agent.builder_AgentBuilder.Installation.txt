```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Installation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 49 lines of code (loc=49), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. No public methods (nopm=0) or public fields (nopf=0) suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
