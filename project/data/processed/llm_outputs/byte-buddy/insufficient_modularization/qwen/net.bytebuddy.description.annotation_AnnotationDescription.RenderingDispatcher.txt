    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 1 public field, 0 methods, and 0 public methods. The WMC is 0, NC is 0, and DIT is 0 indicating minimal complexity. With only 63 lines of code and no methods, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly simplified and decomposed."
