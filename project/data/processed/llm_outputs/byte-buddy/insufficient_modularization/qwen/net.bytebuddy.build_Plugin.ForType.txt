    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 39 lines of code, 2 fields, 0 methods, and 0 dependencies going outside the immediate package. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and the LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
