{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForFailedElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 35 lines of code (loc=35), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. No package dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships suggest this is a simple, self-contained class that is already sufficiently modularized."
