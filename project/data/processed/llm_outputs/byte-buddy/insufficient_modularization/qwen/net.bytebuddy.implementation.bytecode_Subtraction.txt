    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Subtraction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 46 lines of code (loc=46), and a simple weighted method count (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=2, all private) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate proper modularization. The DIT=1 shows it's a base class, and LCOM=0.667 indicates reasonable cohesion."
