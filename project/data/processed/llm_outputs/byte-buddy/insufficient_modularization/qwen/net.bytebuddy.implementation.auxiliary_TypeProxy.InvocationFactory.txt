    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy.InvocationFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0), WMC=0, and only 39 lines of code (loc=39). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. While LCOM=-1.0 suggests potential cohesion issues, the absence of methods makes it impossible to assess modularization needs. The class appears to be a simple data or configuration class rather than a complex implementation requiring decomposition."
