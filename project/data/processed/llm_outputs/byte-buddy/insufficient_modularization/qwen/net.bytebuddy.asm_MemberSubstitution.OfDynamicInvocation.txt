{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfDynamicInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 51 lines of code (loc=51), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicate this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The class does not exhibit signs of needing further decomposition as it has minimal functionality and complexity."
