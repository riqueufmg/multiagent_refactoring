    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 34 lines of code (loc=34), and no dependencies other than its parent class. The low number of fields (nof=2) and lack of complex metrics (lcom=-1.0 due to no methods) indicate this is a simple, well-modularized class that does not require further decomposition."
