{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class has dependencies on 9 other classes, this is likely due to its role as a factory class that needs to interact with various components. The low size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization - rather, the class appears to be appropriately sized and focused."
