    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayAccess.Putter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 12 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 weighted method count. The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. While nested classes might suggest modularization opportunities, the extremely low complexity metrics indicate this is a simple, lightweight class that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
