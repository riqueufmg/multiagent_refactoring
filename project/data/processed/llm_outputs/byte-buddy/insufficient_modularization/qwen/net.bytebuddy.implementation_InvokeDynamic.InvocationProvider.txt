    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 41 fields (nof=41) and 1259 lines of code (loc=1259), indicating high size and complexity that suggests insufficient modularization. The lack of methods (nom=0) despite high field count suggests poor decomposition where related functionality is not properly separated into distinct methods or classes."
