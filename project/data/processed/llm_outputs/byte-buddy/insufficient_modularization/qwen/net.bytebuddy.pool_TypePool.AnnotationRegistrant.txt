    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.AnnotationRegistrant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 274 lines of code (loc) which is excessively high for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has 11 fields (nof) which suggests it is managing multiple responsibilities. The absence of methods (nom=0) is suspicious and may indicate that this class is not properly decomposed or is serving as a data holder with implicit behavior, both of which are characteristics of insufficient modularization."
