    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (80), methods (42), and lines of code (2648), indicating it is large and potentially complex. The presence of numerous inner classes and dependencies (49) suggests that the class may be handling too many responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to improve modularity and reduce complexity."
