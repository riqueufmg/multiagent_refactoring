    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy.ClassResettingTransformer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 13 lines of code (loc=13) and zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it is already highly modularized. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. With zero weighted method count (wmc=0) and no class coupling (nc=0), this class represents a simple, well-modularized component that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
