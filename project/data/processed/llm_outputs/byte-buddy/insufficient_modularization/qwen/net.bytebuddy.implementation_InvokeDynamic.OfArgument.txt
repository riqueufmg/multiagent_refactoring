{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.OfArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 29 lines of code (loc). It has minimal dependencies with only 2 fanout connections and no fanin. The low number of fields (nof=1) and lack of complex relationships (lcom=-1.0, dit=0, nc=0) indicate this is a simple, well-focused class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
