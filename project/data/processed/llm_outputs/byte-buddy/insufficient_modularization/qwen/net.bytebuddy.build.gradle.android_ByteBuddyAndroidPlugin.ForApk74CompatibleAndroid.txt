    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5), 0 methods (nom=0), and 97 lines of code (loc=97). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependency on ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask, the low method count and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a specialized inner class with limited responsibilities."
