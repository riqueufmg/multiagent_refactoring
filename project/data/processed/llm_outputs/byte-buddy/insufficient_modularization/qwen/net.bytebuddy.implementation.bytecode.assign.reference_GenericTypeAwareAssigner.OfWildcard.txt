    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 72 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0). The low number of methods and minimal code size indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
