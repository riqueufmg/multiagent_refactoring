    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 41 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and WMC of 0. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
