{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.Delegate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 21 lines of code (loc=21). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) and it has no internal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). While it has 9 external dependencies, the class itself is minimal and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple delegate pattern implementation with low internal complexity."
