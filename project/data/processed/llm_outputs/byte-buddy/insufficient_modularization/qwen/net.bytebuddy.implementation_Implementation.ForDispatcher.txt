{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.ForDispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields (nof=4), 0 methods (nom=0), 62 lines of code (loc=62), and depth of inheritance tree of 1 (dit=1). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the current metrics do not indicate sufficient size or complexity to warrant classification as Insufficient Modularization."
