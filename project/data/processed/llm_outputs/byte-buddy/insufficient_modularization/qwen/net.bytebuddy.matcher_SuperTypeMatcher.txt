    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.SuperTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 26 lines of code (loc=26) and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The number of fields is minimal (nof=1) and there are no complex dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships that would indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be properly decomposed with a focused responsibility."
