{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForField",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 fields (nof=12) and 261 lines of code (loc=261), but no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and no complexity metrics (wmc=0). This suggests a large, data-heavy class that likely contains significant implementation logic but lacks proper method decomposition. The high field count combined with zero methods indicates insufficient modularization where implementation details are likely embedded elsewhere or the class serves as a large data container without proper behavioral decomposition."
