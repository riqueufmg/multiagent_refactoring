    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 93 lines of code which is relatively small, and all metrics show minimal complexity (WMC=0, NOF=0, NOM=0, NC=0, DIT=0). There are no dependencies indicating tight coupling, and LCOM=-1.0 suggests good cohesion. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a well-contained, simple component."
