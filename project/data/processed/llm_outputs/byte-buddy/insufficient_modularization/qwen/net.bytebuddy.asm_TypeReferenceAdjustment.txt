    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeReferenceAdjustment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (458 LOC) with reasonable method count (5 methods, 10 fields), low complexity (WMC=5), and acceptable cohesion (LCOM=0.4). While it has multiple dependencies (11 external classes), this is typical for bytecode manipulation libraries. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
