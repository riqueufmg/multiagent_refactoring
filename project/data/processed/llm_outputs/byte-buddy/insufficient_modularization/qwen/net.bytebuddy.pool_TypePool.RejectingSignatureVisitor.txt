    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.RejectingSignatureVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, and only 111 lines of code. It has no methods (NOPM=0, NOM=0) and only one field (NOF=1, NOPF=0). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity metrics, indicates that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits for reducing size or complexity."
