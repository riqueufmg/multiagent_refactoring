    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForNonArrayType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Cannot detect Insufficient Modularization smell due to lack of relevant metrics. Key metrics like number of methods (nom), number of public methods (nopm), and weighted method count (wmc) are all zero, making it impossible to assess the class's complexity and modularization quality. The class has 121 lines of code but without method-level metrics, decomposition opportunities cannot be evaluated."
