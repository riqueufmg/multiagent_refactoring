    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3, nopf=0). The lines of code (loc=192) are distributed across a small number of simple elements. The lack of methods and low structural complexity indicate sufficient modularization for this class's current scope."
