    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 1 field (nof=1), and low complexity (wmc=5, loc=36). The LCOM value is 0.0 indicating good cohesion. These metrics indicate proper modularization without excessive size or complexity that would require further decomposition."
