    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForStubValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 82 lines of code (loc=82). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The class does not exhibit high complexity or size that would indicate a need for further decomposition."
