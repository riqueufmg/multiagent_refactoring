{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldRegistry.Compiled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 fields and 82 lines of code. It has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) indicating minimal implementation complexity. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest the class is already sufficiently decomposed for its current responsibilities."
