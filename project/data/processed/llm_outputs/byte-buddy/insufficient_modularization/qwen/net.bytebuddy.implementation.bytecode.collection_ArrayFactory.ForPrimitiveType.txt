    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayFactory.ForPrimitiveType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and minimal size (loc=64). The lack of methods and low field count indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
