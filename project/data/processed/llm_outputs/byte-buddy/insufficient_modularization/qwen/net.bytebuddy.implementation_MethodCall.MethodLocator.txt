    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.MethodLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 139 lines of code (loc=139). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of fields, this appears to be an interface or abstract class that serves as a locator pattern implementation. The low method count and field count suggest it is already well-decomposed for its purpose, and the size is appropriate for a specialized locator component in a bytecode manipulation library."
