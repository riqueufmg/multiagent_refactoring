    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ArgumentHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 418 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has 11 fields (nof) and depends on 4 external classes, suggesting it has multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further modularization to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
