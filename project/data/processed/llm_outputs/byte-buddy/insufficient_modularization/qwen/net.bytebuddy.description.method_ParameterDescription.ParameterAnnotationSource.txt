    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription.ParameterAnnotationSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 54 lines of code (loc=54). It has minimal functionality with only 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and no dependencies on other classes except for a build plugin. The low number of methods and fields indicates proper modularization for its current scope and functionality."
