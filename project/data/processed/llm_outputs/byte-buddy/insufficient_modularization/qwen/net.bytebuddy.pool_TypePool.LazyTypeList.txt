{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyTypeList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 55 lines of code (loc=55). It also has minimal dependencies on only 2 other classes and no fan-in or fan-out dependencies. The low method count and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
