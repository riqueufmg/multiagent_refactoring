    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.RequiredPhase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The LCOM value of 0.8 suggests reasonable cohesion within the class. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to have a clear, single responsibility. The low number of methods and fields, combined with the manageable size and good cohesion, does not indicate insufficient modularization."
