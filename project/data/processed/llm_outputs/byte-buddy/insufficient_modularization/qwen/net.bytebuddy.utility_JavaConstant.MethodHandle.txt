    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.MethodHandle",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 522 lines of code (loc) which indicates high size, and contains 11 fields (nof) with no methods (nom), suggesting poor decomposition where data and behavior are not properly separated. The lack of methods (wmc = 0) combined with substantial size indicates insufficient modularization where the class likely contains too much responsibility without proper behavioral decomposition."
