    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.BindingResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 161 lines of code (loc=161). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low complexity indicators suggest this is likely an interface or abstract class that serves as a structural definition rather than a complex implementation. The absence of fan-in and fan-out dependencies also indicates minimal coupling. While the LOC is somewhat high for the number of methods, the overall simplicity and structural nature of this class does not indicate insufficient modularization."
