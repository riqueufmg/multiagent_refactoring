    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and relatively small size (loc=92). The lack of methods and low field count indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
