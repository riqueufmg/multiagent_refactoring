    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 fields (nof=13) and 148 lines of code (loc=148), but no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). Without method information, it's impossible to assess implementation complexity or determine if further decomposition would be beneficial. The class appears to be a data structure or configuration class rather than a complex implementation that would exhibit insufficient modularization."
