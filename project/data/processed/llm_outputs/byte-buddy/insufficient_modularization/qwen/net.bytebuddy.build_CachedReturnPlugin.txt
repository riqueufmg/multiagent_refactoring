    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=5, nopm=5, wmc=11) and 260 lines of code (loc=260), indicating high implementation complexity. The lack of further decomposition and the presence of multiple responsibilities suggest that the class could benefit from being split into smaller, more focused components to reduce size and complexity."
