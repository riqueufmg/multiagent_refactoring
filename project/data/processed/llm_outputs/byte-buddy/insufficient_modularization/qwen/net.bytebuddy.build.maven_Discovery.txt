    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.Discovery",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7) and 60 lines of code (loc=60), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=7) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to have a focused responsibility. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.857) suggest reasonable internal structure. The class has minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicating it is not overly coupled. These metrics do not indicate sufficient size or complexity to warrant further decomposition."
