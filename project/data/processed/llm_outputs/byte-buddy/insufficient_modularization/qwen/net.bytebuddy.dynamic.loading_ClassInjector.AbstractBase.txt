    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 0 methods, 57 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The lack of methods and low structural complexity indicates it is already sufficiently modularized. No further decomposition would provide meaningful reduction in size or complexity."
