    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is likely a marker interface or empty placeholder class rather than a class with insufficient modularization. The low LOC count (21) is consistent with a minimal class structure. Insufficient Modularization typically applies to classes with high complexity that could be decomposed, but this class shows minimal complexity indicators."
