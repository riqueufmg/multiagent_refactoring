    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), low WMC (wmc=0), and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The LOC is 152 which is moderate but acceptable for a class with minimal functionality. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused component with no indication of insufficient modularization."
