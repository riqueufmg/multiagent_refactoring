{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy.Passive",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 29 lines of code. The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=0) indicates no method complexity. With no methods or fields and minimal LOC, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly decomposed and simple."
