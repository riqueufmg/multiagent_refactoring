    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList.ForTypes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 46 lines of code (loc=46), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or minimal implementation that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
