    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForExplicitField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 68 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal method complexity. While the class has dependencies on 4 external types, its internal structure is simple with no methods to decompose further. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggests adequate modularization for its current scope."
