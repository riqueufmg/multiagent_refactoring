{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Assignment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 28 lines of code (loc=28), and a weighted method count of 2 (wmc=2). The lack of fields (nof=1) and methods (nopf=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal functionality. With zero dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance (dit=0), this appears to be a simple, well-decomposed class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
