    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 28 lines of code. The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. With such low size and complexity metrics, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
