    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.OfNonPrimitiveArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 45 lines of code (loc=45). It has minimal responsibilities with only 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and no method complexity (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate proper modularization rather than insufficient decomposition."
