{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.ForFloat",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. There are no dependencies other than TypeDescription which is minimal. The class appears to be a simple, well-encapsulated inner class with focused responsibility, not exhibiting signs of insufficient modularization."
