    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 45 lines of code (loc=45), and depth of inheritance of 1 (dit=1). The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low field count indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
