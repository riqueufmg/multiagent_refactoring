    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.ConstantTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 93 lines of code (loc=93). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and simple structure indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
