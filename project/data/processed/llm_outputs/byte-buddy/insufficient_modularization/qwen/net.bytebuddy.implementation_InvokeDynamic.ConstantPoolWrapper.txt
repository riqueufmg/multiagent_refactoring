    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 177 lines of code (loc=177). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and low complexity metrics indicate this is likely a simple data holder or wrapper class that is already sufficiently modularized for its purpose."
