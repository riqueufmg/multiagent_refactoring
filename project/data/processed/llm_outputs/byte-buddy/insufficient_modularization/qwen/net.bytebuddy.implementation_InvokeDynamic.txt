    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (43), a high number of fields (53), and a high lines of code count (2217). The Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) value is 66, indicating high complexity. The class also contains many nested classes and interfaces as dependencies, suggesting that it could be further decomposed to reduce its size and complexity."
