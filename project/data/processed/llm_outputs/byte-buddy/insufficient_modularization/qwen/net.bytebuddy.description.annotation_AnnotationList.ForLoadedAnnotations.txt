    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList.ForLoadedAnnotations",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 47 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), and no inheritance hierarchy (dit=0). While it does have one field (nof=1) and depends on AnnotationDescription, the size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-contained component."
