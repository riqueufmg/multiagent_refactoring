    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 36 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no public methods or fields that would suggest complex behavior requiring further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or wrapper with minimal functionality that does not warrant further modularization."
