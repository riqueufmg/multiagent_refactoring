    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForMismatchedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 100 lines of code (loc=100). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is a simple data holder or value object rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The negative LCOM value (-1.0) indicates good cohesion among the existing elements."
