    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.Conversion",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, 34 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
