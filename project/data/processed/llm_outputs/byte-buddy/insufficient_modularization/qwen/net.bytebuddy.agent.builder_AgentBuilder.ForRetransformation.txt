    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForRetransformation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 29 lines of code (loc=29). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While the class is nested (indicated by the dot in the name), its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization. The negative LCOM value (-1.0) suggests good cohesion, and zero fan-in and fan-out indicate minimal external dependencies. The class appears to be a simple, well-contained component."
