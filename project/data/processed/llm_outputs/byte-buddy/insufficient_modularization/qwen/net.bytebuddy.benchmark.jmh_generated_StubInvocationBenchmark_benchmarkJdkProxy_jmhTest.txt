    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkJdkProxy_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (9 total, 8 public), low complexity (WMC=42), and reasonable size (276 LOC). While the class has many fields (263), this is typical for JMH-generated benchmark test classes which often contain numerous generated fields for benchmark state management. The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion, and the class appears to serve a single, well-defined purpose as a JMH benchmark test wrapper."
