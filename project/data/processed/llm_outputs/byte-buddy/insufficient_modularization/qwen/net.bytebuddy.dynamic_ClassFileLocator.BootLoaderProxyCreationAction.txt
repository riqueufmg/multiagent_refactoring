    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (loc=13, wmc=0, nof=0, nom=0) and no internal dependencies, indicating it is already well-decomposed and minimal in size and complexity. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be properly decomposed for its functionality."
