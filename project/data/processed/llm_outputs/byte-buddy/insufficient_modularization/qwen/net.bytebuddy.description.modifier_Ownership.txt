    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Ownership",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=5), suggesting low complexity. The class has only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), indicating proper encapsulation. The Lack of Cohesion metric (lcom=0.8) while on the higher side, is not excessively high given the small number of methods. The class has no fan-in or fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), suggesting it's not heavily coupled. Overall, the class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its size and complexity."
