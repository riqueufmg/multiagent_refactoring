    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithPrefix_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size with 276 lines of code and 9 methods. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) of 42 indicates moderate complexity. With 263 fields, while high, this is typical for JMH-generated benchmark test classes which automatically generate numerous fields for benchmark state management. The low LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the class appears to be a generated test class with a single responsibility pattern, making further decomposition unnecessary."
