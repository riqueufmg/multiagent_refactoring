    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=9) and lines of code (loc=506), indicating potential complexity. It also has a high Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=9), suggesting significant internal complexity. The class depends on multiple other classes (fanout=0 but dependencies list shows 16 dependencies), which may indicate it is doing too much and could be further decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
