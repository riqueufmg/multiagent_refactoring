    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.WithLookup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 36 lines of code (loc). It also has minimal dependencies with only 4 fanout connections. The low metric values indicate proper modularization rather than insufficient decomposition."
