    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.OfInstrumentedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 29 lines of code and all metrics (nof, nopf, nom, nopm, wmc, nc, dit, fanin, fanout) showing zero values, indicating minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The negative LCOM value (-1.0) suggests good cohesion within the limited scope of this class."
