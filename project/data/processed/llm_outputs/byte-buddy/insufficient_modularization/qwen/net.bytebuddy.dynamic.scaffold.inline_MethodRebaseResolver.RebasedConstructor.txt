    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 76 lines of code (loc). It has minimal fields (2) and no inheritance (dit=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or value object with no complex behavior that would require further decomposition."
