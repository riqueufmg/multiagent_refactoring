{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.FailSafeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 37 lines of code (loc=37) and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and simple dependencies suggest it is already well-decomposed. The metrics indicate a small, focused class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
