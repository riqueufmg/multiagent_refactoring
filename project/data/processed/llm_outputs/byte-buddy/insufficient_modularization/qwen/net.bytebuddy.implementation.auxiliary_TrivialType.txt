{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TrivialType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 33 lines of code (loc=33), and weighted method count of 3 (wmc=3). It has a reasonable number of dependencies (7) for its size and purpose. The lack of fields (nof=1) and simple method structure (nopm=2 out of 3 methods being public) indicates it is already well-decomposed. The DIT=1 shows it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy, and LCOM=0.667 suggests reasonable cohesion."
