    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Source",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 fields (nof=28) and 956 lines of code (loc=956), indicating high size and complexity. With 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 public methods (nopm=0), the class appears to be a data-only class that lacks proper behavioral decomposition. The high number of fields suggests that further decomposition could reduce its size and implementation complexity, which are key indicators of Insufficient Modularization."
