    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender.Size",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 48 lines of code (loc=48). It has minimal fields (nof=3, nopf=1) and no inheritance (dit=0) or coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) relationships. The low number of responsibilities and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization for this small data class."
