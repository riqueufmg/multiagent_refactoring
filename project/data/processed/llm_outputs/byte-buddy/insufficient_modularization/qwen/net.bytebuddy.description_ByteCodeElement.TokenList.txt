{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement.TokenList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 inheritance depth (dit=0), 0 children (nc=0), and only 51 lines of code (loc=51). The low number of methods and low complexity metrics (wmc=0) indicate that further decomposition is not necessary as the class is already sufficiently simple and small."
