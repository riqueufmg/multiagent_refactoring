    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForInlining",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 52 fields and 1331 lines of code, indicating high size and potential complexity. The lack of methods (nom: 0) and lack of class hierarchy information (dit: 0, nc: 0) suggests insufficient decomposition of responsibilities. The high number of dependencies (23 external classes) indicates the class is managing too many concerns without proper modularization."
