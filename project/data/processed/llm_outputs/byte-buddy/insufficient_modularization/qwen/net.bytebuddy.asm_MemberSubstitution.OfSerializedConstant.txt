    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfSerializedConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 53 lines of code (loc=53). The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class with no implementation complexity that would benefit from modularization."
