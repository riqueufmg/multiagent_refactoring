    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.TypeSortMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 26 lines of code (loc=26), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class-level dependencies (nc=0, dit=0), this class appears to be well-focused and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
