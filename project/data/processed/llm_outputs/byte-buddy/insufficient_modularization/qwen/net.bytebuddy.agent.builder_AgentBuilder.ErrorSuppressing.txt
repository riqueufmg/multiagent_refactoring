    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (0 methods, 0 fields, 43 lines of code) and no dependencies, indicating it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The low LOC and absence of any structural complexity metrics suggest this is a minimal class that does not require further decomposition."
