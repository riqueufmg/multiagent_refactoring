    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeReferenceAdjustment.TypeReferenceMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 117 lines of code which is not excessively large, but more importantly, the metrics indicate this class has 0 fields (nof), 0 public fields (nopf), 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), and WMC of 0, suggesting it may be an empty or minimal class structure. Without meaningful internal complexity or behavioral responsibilities, there is insufficient evidence to determine that further decomposition would be beneficial. The class appears to be a specialized visitor implementation that may be appropriately focused on a single responsibility."
