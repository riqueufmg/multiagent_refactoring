    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ParameterBag",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 44 lines of code (loc=44). It has minimal fields (nof=2) and no dependencies on other classes except for StackSize. The low method count and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization for its current purpose."
