{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.MethodHandles",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 28 lines of code (loc=28). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While nested classes can sometimes indicate insufficient modularization, this particular class appears to be a simple utility or constant holder with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
