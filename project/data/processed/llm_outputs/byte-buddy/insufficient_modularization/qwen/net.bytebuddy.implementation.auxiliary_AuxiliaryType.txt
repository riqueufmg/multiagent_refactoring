    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2), 5 fields (nof=5), and 109 lines of code. The lack of public methods (nopm=0, nopf=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate proper encapsulation. The class appears to be well-focused with a single responsibility, and there's no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
