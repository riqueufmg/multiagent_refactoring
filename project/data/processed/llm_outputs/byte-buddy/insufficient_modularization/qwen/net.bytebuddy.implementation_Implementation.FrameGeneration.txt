    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 129 lines of code. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. No methods (nom=0, nopm=0) suggest this is likely a data-only class or simple configuration class that is already sufficiently modularized."
