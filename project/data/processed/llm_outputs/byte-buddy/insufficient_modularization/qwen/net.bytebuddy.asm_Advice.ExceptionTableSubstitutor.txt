    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 65 lines of code (loc=65). The low number of fields (nof=2) and absence of inheritance (dit=0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-contained component with minimal responsibilities."
