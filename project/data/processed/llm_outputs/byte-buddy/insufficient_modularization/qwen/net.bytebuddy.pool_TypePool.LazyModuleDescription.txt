    "justification": "The class has 10 fields (nof=10) and 160 lines of code (loc=160), but lacks sufficient metrics data to determine modularization issues. Metrics like WMC, NOM, and LCOM show default/zero values, and there are no method counts provided. Without complete complexity metrics or evidence of excessive responsibilities, insufficient modularization cannot be confirmed."
