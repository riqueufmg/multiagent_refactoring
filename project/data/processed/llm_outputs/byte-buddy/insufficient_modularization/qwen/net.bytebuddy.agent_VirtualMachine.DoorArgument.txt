    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.DoorArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 32 lines of code (loc=32). It contains 6 fields (nof=6, nopf=6) which suggests it's a simple data holder or parameter object. The lack of methods and low LOC indicate it's already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
