{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Unresolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 33 lines of code (loc=33). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class has 8 dependencies, its extremely simple internal structure and low size do not indicate insufficient modularization - it appears to be a simple data holder or marker class that is appropriately decomposed."
