    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Writable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 40 lines of code (loc=40). With no methods to decompose and minimal size, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data structure or interface rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
