{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Bound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), and 42 lines of code (loc=42). The lack of methods and low field count indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex implementation that needs modularization."
