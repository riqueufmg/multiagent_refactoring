    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.MethodDefinition",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 863 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality that should be decomposed into smaller classes. The class has 3 fields (nof) but no methods (nom=0), suggesting it may be a data-only class that lacks proper behavioral decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0) combined with high line count (loc=863) indicates insufficient modularization where the class should be broken down into smaller, more focused components."
