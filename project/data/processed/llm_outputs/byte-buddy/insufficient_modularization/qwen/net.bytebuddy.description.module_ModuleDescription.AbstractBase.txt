    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 54 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies fan-in or fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0). The WMC is 0 indicating minimal complexity. While it's an abstract base class with DIT=2, its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization."
