    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList.ForTokens",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 42 lines of code (loc=42). The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal complexity. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, suggesting no complex method implementations. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion in Methods) is -1.0 which may indicate insufficient data rather than poor cohesion. The class appears to be a simple data structure or wrapper with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
