    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 43 lines of code (loc=43). It has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no class hierarchy (dit=0, nc=0). The low number of methods and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization for this class's purpose."
