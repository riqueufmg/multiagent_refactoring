{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMember",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 40 lines of code (loc=40). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low field count indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex business logic class that would benefit from modularization."
