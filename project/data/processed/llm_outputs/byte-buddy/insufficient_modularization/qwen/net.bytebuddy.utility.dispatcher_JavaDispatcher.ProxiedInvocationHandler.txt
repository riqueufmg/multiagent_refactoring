{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.ProxiedInvocationHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 73 lines of code (loc=73). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nom=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or placeholder rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
