    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.EntryPoint.Unvalidated",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 35 lines of code (loc=35), and no method complexity (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration object rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
