{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.SimpleModuleFinder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 30 lines of code (loc=30). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class has dependencies on 3 other classes, its internal structure is too simple to warrant further decomposition. The lack of methods and low LOC suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
