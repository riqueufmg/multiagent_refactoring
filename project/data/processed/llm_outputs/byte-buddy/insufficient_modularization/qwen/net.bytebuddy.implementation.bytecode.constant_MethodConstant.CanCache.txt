    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 0 lines of code (loc=10 but this appears to be file-level not class-level), and no fields (nof=0). With no methods or fields, there is no meaningful decomposition possible. The class appears to be a marker or configuration class that doesn't require further modularization."
