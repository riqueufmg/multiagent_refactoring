    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 4 fields (nof=4), with a low weighted method count (wmc=4), indicating low complexity. The class size is small (loc=136) and it has no children (dit=0) or coupled classes (nc=0), suggesting it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
