    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.ExternalAttachment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, 36 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. There are no dependencies which suggests minimal complexity. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately simple and focused."
