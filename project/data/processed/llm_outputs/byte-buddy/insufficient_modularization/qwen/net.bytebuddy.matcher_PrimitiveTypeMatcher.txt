    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.PrimitiveTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 1 public method (nopm=1), with very low complexity (wmc=2) and only 15 lines of code (loc=15). The lack of fields (nof=0) and low method count indicate proper modularization. The negative LCOM value (-1.0) suggests good cohesion, and the minimal dependencies (2) do not indicate complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
