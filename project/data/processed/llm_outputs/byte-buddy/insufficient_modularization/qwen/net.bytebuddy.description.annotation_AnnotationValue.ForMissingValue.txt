    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields, 0 methods, and 101 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal method complexity. While it has 3 dependencies, the low internal complexity and small size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-contained entity for representing missing annotation values."
