{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.WithImplicitTarget",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 59 lines of code (loc=59). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies going out (fanout=0). While the class has some dependencies on 4 other classes, its extremely low internal complexity and minimal size do not indicate insufficient modularization - it appears to be a simple, well-decomposed class."
