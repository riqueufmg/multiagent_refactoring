    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 fields, 0 methods, and 85 lines of code. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. No methods are present to suggest implementation complexity issues, and the class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class."
