    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 88 lines of code (loc=88). While the LOC is relatively high for a class with no methods, the lack of methods and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, dit=1) indicate this is likely a simple data class or nested class with minimal functionality. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition."
