    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem.ForNio2CapableVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), and 97 lines of code (loc=97). The low method count and relatively simple structure indicate it is already well-decomposed. The depth of inheritance tree is 1 (dit=1), suggesting no complex inheritance hierarchy. The class appears to be a simple, focused implementation rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
