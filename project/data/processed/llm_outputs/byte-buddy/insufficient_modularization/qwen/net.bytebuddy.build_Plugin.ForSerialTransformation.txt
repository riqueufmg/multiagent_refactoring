    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForSerialTransformation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 107 lines of code (loc=107). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
