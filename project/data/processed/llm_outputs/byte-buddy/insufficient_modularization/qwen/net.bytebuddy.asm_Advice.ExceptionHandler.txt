    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ExceptionHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 104 lines of code (loc=104). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and simple structure (dit=1, wmc=0) indicate this is likely a data class or simple configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The absence of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) suggests it's not a behaviorally complex class that would benefit from modularization."
