    "justification": "The class has 10 fields but no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating it may be a data-only class or incomplete implementation. However, with only 209 lines of code and no visible complexity metrics indicating high complexity, there is insufficient evidence to conclude it suffers from Insufficient Modularization. The lack of methods prevents assessment of decomposition needs."
