    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Resolution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 71 lines of code (loc=71). The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), suggesting minimal implementation complexity. The Lack of Cohesion metric is -1.0 (lcom=-1.0) which may indicate good cohesion. The class has no fan-in or fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggesting it is not heavily interconnected. Given these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed."
