    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayAccess.Loader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 12 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and WMC of 0. The class appears to be a simple loader class that delegates to StackManipulation interface implementations. Given its minimal size and complexity, there is no indication that further decomposition would provide benefits. The class seems appropriately modularized for its current functionality."
