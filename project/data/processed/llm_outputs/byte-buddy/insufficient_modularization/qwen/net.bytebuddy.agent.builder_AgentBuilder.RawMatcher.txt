    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.RawMatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 fields (nof=8) and 254 lines of code (loc=254), indicating a relatively large and complex class that could benefit from further decomposition. The class contains multiple nested classes and interfaces within a single file, suggesting insufficient modularization. The high line count and multiple responsibilities indicate that the class has not been completely decomposed, supporting further breakdown to reduce size and implementation complexity."
