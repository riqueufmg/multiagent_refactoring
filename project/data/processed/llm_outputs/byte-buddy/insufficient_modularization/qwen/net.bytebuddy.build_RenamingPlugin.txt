{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RenamingPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with all being public (nopm=9), and a WMC of 9 indicating high complexity. The LCOM value of 0.5555555555555556 suggests poor cohesion, and the class has 208 lines of code (loc=208) with 7 fields (nof=7). The class directly depends on 15 other classes, indicating high coupling. These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
