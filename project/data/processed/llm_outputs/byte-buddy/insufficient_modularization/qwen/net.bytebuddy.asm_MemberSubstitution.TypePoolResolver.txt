    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.TypePoolResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 91 lines of code (loc=91). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and simple field structure suggests it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit complexity that would warrant further modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex entity requiring decomposition."
