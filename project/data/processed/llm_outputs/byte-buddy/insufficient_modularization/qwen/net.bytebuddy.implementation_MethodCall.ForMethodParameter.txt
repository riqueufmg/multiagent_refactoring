{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForMethodParameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 0 public methods (nopm=0). The lines of code (loc=69) are relatively small and the weighted method count (wmc=0) indicates no method complexity. The lack of methods and low field count suggests this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
