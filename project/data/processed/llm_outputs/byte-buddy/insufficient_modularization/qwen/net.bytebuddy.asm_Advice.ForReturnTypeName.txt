    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). With minimal functionality and low complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already sufficiently simple and decomposed."
