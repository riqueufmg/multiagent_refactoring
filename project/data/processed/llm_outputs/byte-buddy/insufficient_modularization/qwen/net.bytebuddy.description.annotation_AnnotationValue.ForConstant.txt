{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 730 lines of code (loc) which indicates high implementation complexity, and it has 4 fields (nof) but no methods (nom=0), suggesting poor decomposition where data and behavior are not properly organized. The lack of methods despite having fields indicates insufficient modularization where the class likely contains complex logic not properly decomposed into smaller, focused methods."
