    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForStackManipulation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 fields (nof=13) and 259 lines of code (loc=259), but lacks method count data (nom=0, wmc=0) necessary to properly assess modularization. Without knowing the number and complexity of methods, cannot determine if further decomposition is needed. The class appears to be a specialized component for stack manipulation within the Byte Buddy framework, suggesting it may already be appropriately scoped for its specific responsibility."
