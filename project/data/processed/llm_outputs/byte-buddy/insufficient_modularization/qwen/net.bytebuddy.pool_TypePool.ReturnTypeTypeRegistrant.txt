    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While it's an inner class, its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization - it appears to be appropriately sized for its current functionality."
