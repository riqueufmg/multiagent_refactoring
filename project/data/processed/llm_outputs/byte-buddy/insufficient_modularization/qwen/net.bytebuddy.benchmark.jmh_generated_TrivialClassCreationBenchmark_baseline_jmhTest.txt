    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 methods (nom=9) and 275 lines of code (loc=275), which is not excessive for a benchmark test class. The weighted method count (wmc=42) indicates moderate complexity but is reasonable for generated benchmark code. The class appears to be a JMH-generated benchmark test class with minimal functionality, serving a specific purpose as indicated by its dependencies on other benchmark types. The low number of methods and moderate complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization."
