    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForRegularInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 49 lines of code (loc=49), and minimal dependencies on only 2 external classes. The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
