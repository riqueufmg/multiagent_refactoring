    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.FallbackStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), no methods (nom=0), and relatively low lines of code (loc=80). The lack of methods and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) indicate this is likely an interface or abstract class that serves as a specification rather than an implementation. Without concrete implementation complexity or size issues, there's insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization."
