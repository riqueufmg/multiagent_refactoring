    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 58 lines of code (loc=58). With such a small number of fields and no methods, the class is already minimally decomposed. The low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
