    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 92 lines of code (loc=92). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods present, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already in a highly decomposed state."
