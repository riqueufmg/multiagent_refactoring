    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription.InGenericShape",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0) and fan-in/fan-out are both 0, indicating minimal functionality. The class appears to be a simple inner class or interface with minimal responsibilities, not exhibiting insufficient modularization since there is little to decompose further."
