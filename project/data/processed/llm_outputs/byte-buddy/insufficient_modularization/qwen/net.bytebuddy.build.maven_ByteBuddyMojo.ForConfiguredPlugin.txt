    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=26 but this appears to be the file location rather than method count), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
