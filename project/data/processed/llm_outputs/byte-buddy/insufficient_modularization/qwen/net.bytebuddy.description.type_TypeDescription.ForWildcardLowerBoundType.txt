    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForWildcardLowerBoundType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 50 lines of code (loc=50), and weighted method count of 0 (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or placeholder rather than a complex entity requiring modularization."
