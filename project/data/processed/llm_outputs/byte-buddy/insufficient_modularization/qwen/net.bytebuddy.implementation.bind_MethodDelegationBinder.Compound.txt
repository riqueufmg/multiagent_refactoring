    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 42 lines of code (loc=42). It also has minimal dependencies with only 1 field (nof=1) and no method parameters or fan-in/fan-out connections. The low complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
