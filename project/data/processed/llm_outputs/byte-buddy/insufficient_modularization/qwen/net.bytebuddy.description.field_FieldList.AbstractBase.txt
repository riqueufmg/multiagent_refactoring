    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 29 lines of code, WMC of 0, and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0). It also has minimal dependencies on only 3 external classes. The low size and complexity indicate sufficient modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
