    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (loc=14, wmc=0, nom=0) and no dependencies, indicating it is already well-decomposed and minimal in size and implementation complexity. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be properly decomposed."
