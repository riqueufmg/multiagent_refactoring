    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.OfTypeArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 56 lines of code (loc=56). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies on other classes except TypeList. The class appears to be a simple, well-modularized inner class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
