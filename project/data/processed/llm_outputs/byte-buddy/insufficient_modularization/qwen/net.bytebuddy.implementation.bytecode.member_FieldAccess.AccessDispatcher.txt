    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.FieldAccess.AccessDispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 74 lines of code (loc=74). It has minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only 1 field (nof=1). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
