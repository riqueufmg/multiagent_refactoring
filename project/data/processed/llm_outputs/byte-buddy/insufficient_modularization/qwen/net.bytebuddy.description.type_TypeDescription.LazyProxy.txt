    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.LazyProxy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and minimal size (loc=35). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple proxy implementation with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
