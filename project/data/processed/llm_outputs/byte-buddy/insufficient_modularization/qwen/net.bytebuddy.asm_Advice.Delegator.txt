    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Delegator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 182 lines of code (loc=182). While the class has a moderate number of fields, the low method count and relatively contained size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
