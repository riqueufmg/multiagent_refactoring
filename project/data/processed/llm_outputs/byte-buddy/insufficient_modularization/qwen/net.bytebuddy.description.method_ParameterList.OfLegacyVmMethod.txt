    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 39 lines of code (loc=39), and no method complexity (wmc=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of complex functionality that would benefit from further decomposition."
