    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.ForThisValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, and only 62 lines of code. It has minimal dependencies (5 external classes) and no fan-in or fan-out relationships. The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity metrics, indicates sufficient modularization for this class."
