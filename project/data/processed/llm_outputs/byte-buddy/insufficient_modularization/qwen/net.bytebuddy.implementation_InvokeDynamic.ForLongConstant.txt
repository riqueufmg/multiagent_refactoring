    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForLongConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 28 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and WMC of 0. The low number of fields (1) and methods (0) indicates minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, focused implementation that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
