    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is either an empty class or a nested class with minimal implementation. With only 45 lines of code (loc=45) and no complexity metrics indicating high complexity (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0), there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed."
