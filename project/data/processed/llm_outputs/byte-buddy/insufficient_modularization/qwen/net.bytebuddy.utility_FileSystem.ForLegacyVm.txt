    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem.ForLegacyVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 46 lines of code (loc=46). It also has no inheritance hierarchy (dit=1) and no dependencies on other classes except for a build plugin annotation. The class appears to be a simple, lightweight implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
