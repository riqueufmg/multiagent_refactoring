    "class": "org.gradle.api.tasks.PathSensitivity",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 16 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 weighted method count. The lack of methods and fields indicates it is likely an enumeration or simple data class that is already sufficiently modularized. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed."
