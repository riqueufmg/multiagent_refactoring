    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (163 nof), methods (47 nom), and lines of code (8174 loc), indicating it is large and potentially complex. It also has a high Weighted Methods per Class (wmc: 47), which suggests high complexity. The class contains numerous inner classes and dependencies (as seen in the dependencies list), which further indicates that it might benefit from decomposition to improve modularity and reduce complexity."
