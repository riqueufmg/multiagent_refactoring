    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 47 lines of code (loc), 1 field (nof), no methods (nom), and zero weighted method count (wmc). The class appears to be a simple, well-focused implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
