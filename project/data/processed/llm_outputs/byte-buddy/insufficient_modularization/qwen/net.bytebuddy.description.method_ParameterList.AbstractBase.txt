    "justification": "The class has only 55 lines of code (loc), 0 methods (nom), and 0 fields (nof), indicating it is already well-decomposed. The low complexity metrics (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0) and minimal dependencies (5 external dependencies) suggest this abstract base class is properly modularized and serves as a lightweight base implementation without excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
