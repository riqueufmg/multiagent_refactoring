    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 0 lines of code (loc=49 but this appears to be the file level, not class level), and no dependencies or coupling metrics indicating minimal functionality. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class that does not require further decomposition."
