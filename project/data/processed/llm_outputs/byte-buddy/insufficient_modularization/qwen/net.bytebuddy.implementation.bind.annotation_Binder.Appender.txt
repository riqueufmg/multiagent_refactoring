    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and WMC=0. The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex implementation that needs modularization."
