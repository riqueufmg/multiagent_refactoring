    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a manageable size with 276 lines of code and 9 methods. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) is 42, which is moderate. With only 263 fields, the class is not excessively large. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies suggests it's not overly complex in terms of coupling. While the high number of fields (263) is notable, the overall metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition."
