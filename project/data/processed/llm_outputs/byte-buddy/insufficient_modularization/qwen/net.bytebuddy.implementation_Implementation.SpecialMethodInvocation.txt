    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.SpecialMethodInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 157 lines of code (loc=157). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, this appears to be a specialized inner class that is likely implementing a specific functionality compactly. The low method count and field count suggest it is already well-decomposed for its purpose, and the WMC of 0 indicates low complexity. The class does not exhibit the typical characteristics of insufficient modularization such as high complexity or excessive responsibilities."
