    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0), and only 50 lines of code (loc=50). With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods, this class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already highly simplified and decomposed."
