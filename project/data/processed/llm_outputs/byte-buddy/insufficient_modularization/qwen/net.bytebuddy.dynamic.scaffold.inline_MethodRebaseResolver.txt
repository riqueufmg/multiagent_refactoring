    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of lines of code (425 LOC) and a low number of methods (3 NOM), indicating potential insufficient modularization. The class also has a low WMC value (3) relative to its size, suggesting that while the methods may be simple, the overall class complexity and size could benefit from further decomposition."
