    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), and 105 lines of code (loc=105). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal structural complexity (nc=0, dit=0) indicates it is already well-decomposed or represents a simple data structure rather than a complex class that needs further modularization."
