    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.ForHotSpot",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 40 fields and 1213 lines of code, indicating high size and complexity. With 9 public fields, the class exposes significant internal state. The lack of methods (0) suggests either incomplete analysis or poor decomposition where functionality may be embedded in large, complex field initializations or external utilities. The high field count and LOC suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
