{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) with 9 private methods (nopm=9), indicating high implementation complexity. The class contains 430 lines of code (loc=430) and has a weighted method count of 21 (wmc=21), suggesting significant functional complexity. The class also has multiple nested dependencies including 12 external dependencies, which indicates it is managing complex reloading strategies and interactions. The high number of methods, substantial LOC, and multiple dependencies suggest this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
