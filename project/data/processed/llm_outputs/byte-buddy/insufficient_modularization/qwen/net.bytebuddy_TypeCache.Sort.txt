{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.TypeCache.Sort",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low lines of code (loc=34). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal complexity. Since this is likely an enum or simple data class with no behavior to decompose, it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
