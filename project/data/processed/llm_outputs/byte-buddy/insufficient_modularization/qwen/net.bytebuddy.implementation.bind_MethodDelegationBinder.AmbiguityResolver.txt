    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.AmbiguityResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0, nc=0) and reasonable size (loc=146). While it has multiple dependencies (7 external classes), the low method count and complexity suggest it may already be sufficiently modularized rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
