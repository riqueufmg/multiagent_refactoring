    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5), 0 methods (nom=0), and 47 lines of code (loc=47). With no methods implemented and relatively few fields, the class does not exhibit high complexity or size that would indicate insufficient modularization. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low WMC (wmc=0) suggests this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
