    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor.LineNumberPrependingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 32 lines of code (loc=32), and a low weighted method count (wmc=4). The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0). With a low method count, low complexity metrics, and no indication of excessive responsibilities or size, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The low LCOM value (0.0) suggests good cohesion, and the lack of fan-in/fan-out dependencies indicates simplicity in coupling."
