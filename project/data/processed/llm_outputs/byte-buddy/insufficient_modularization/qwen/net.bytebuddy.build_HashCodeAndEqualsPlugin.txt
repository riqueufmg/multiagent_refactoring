```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high LOC (342), high WMC (14), high LCOM (0.7777777777777778), and contains 10 fields with 9 methods where 8 are public. These metrics indicate the class is large, complex, and lacks cohesion, suggesting it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
