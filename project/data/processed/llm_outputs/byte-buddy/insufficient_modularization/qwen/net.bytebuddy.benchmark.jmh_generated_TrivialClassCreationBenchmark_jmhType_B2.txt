    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.TrivialClassCreationBenchmark_jmhType_B2",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 14 lines of code, 12 fields (all public), no methods, and a depth of inheritance of 2. The low WMC (0) and minimal functionality suggest this is likely a simple data holder or benchmark-generated class that does not require further decomposition. The class appears to be intentionally simple and does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
