{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.ToStringMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=11 public, 4 non-public) and 605 lines of code (loc=605), indicating high size and potential complexity. The lack of complete decomposition is suggested by the presence of multiple nested classes (Appender, ValueConsumer, PrefixResolver, Default) within the same file, which increases the class's implementation complexity. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) value of 15 also reflects a relatively high internal complexity that could be reduced through further modularization."
