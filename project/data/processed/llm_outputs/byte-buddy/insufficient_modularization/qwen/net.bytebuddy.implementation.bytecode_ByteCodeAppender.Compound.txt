    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 41 lines of code, 1 field, and 0 methods. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT is 1 showing no deep inheritance. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
