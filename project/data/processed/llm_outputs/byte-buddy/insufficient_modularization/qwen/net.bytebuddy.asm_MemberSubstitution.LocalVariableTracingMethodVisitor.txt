    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.LocalVariableTracingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 21 lines of code (loc=21). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With such low size and complexity metrics, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly decomposed or represents a simple component that doesn't require further decomposition."
