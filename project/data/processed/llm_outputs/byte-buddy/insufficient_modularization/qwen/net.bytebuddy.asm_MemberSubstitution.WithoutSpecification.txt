    "justification": "The class has 373 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating high implementation complexity. It also has 16 fields (nof) and 9 dependencies on other classes, suggesting it has too many responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and complexity."
