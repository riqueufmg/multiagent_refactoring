    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 87 lines of code (loc=87). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of fields, the lack of methods and low structural complexity (wmc=0, nc=0) indicates this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The absence of method-level complexity metrics and dependencies suggests insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization."
