    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.TerminationHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 177 lines of code (loc=177). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate sufficient modularization for this class's current purpose."
