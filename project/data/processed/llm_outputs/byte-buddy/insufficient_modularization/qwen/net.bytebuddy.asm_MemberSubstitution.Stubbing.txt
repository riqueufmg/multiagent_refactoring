    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Stubbing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 23 lines of code (loc), zero methods (nom), zero fields (nof), and zero weighted method count (wmc). The low size and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
