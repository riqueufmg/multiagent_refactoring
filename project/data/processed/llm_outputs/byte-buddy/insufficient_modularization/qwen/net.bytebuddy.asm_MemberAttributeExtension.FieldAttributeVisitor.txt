    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension.FieldAttributeVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields and 0 methods, with a very low LOC count of 34. The low number of fields and methods, combined with minimal complexity metrics (WMC=0, NOM=0), indicates that this class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or visitor implementation with appropriate size and complexity."
