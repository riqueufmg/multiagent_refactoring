    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.ConfigurationConfigurationAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 12 lines of code (loc=12) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low size and complexity metrics indicate insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization - the class appears to be appropriately small and simple."
