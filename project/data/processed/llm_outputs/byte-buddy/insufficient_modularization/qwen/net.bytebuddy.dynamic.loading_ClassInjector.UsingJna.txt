    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingJna",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 236 lines of code (loc=236). While the class has a moderate number of fields and substantial LOC, the lack of methods suggests it may be a data-only class or interface. Without method complexity metrics (wmc=0) and with no clear indication of high complexity or large size that would warrant further decomposition, insufficient modularization cannot be confirmed based on the provided metrics."
