    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 132 lines of code (loc=132). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and simple field structure suggests it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
