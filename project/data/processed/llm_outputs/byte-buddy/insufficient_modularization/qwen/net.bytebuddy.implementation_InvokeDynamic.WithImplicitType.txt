```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.WithImplicitType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 132 lines of code (loc=132). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on 4 other classes and 132 lines of code, the low number of fields and methods suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The absence of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) indicates this may be a data-only class or nested class with minimal behavior, which does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization where further decomposition would be beneficial."
