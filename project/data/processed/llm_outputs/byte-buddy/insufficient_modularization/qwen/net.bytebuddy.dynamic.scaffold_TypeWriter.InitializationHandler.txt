{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.InitializationHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 438 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has 12 fields (nof) and 7 dependencies, suggesting high complexity and responsibility that could be better distributed through modularization. The lack of methods (nom: 0) despite having fields and dependencies indicates potential incomplete decomposition where logic may be embedded in complex field initializations or nested classes rather than explicit method decomposition."
