    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMatchedDynamicInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 67 lines of code (loc=67). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and very simple structure indicates it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class with minimal complexity."
