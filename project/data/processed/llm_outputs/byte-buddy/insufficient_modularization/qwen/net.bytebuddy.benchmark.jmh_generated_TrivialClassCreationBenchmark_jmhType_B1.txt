    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.TrivialClassCreationBenchmark_jmhType_B1",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 18 lines of code, 0 methods, and 256 fields which suggests it might be a data-only class or generated class. While the high number of fields (256) could indicate complexity, the lack of methods (0) and low WMC (0) suggest this is likely a simple data structure rather than a complex class that needs decomposition. The class appears to be machine-generated based on the package name containing 'jmh_generated', which is typical for benchmarking frameworks."
