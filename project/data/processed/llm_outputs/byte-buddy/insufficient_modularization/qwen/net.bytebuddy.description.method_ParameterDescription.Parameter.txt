    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription.Parameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 23 lines of code (loc=23). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already highly simplified and decomposed."
