{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 12 lines of code (loc=12). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) indicating no method complexity. With no methods or fields, there is no meaningful functionality to decompose further, so the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
