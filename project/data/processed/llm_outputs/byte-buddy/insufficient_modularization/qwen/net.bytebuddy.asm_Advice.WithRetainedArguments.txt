    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithRetainedArguments",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 27 lines of code (loc), zero methods (nom, nopm), zero fields (nof, nopf), and zero weighted method count (wmc). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, lightweight component with limited functionality that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
