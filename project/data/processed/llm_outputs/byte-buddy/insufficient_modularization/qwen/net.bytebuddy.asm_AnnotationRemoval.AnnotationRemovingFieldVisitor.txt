    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 28 lines of code. The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) is 0, indicating no method complexity. With minimal functionality and low code volume, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized and decomposed for its current responsibilities."
