    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 59 lines of code (loc=59). It has no fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and no dependencies on other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of methods and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization for this class's current functionality."
