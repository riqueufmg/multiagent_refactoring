    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 76 lines of code (loc=76). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and low field count indicate it is already well-decomposed. The class appears to be a simple data holder or compiled registry entry rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
