    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy.RecordConstructorStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 76 lines of code which is relatively small, and no inheritance hierarchy (dit=1). While it has dependencies on 14 other classes, this is not sufficient evidence for insufficient modularization without knowing the nature of these dependencies. The class appears to be a simple, well-contained component with minimal internal complexity."
