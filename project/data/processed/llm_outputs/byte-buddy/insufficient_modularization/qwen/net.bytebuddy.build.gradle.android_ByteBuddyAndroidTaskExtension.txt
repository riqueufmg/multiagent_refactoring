{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidTaskExtension",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 23 methods (nom=23) with 22 public methods (nopm=22), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The class contains 228 lines of code (loc=228) which is substantial for a single class. The lack of class dependencies (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it may be handling too many concerns internally rather than delegating to other specialized classes. The high method count and substantial LOC suggest this class could benefit from decomposition to reduce implementation complexity and improve modularity."
