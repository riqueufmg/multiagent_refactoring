    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=75 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low complexity indicates insufficient material to warrant further decomposition, despite having 1 field (nof=1) and multiple dependencies which suggest it may be a simple data holder or adapter pattern implementation."
