{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.RelocationHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 fields (nof=17) and 446 lines of code (loc=446), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential incomplete decomposition where functionality might be embedded within field definitions or external dependencies. The class depends on 4 external classes, showing tight coupling. These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
