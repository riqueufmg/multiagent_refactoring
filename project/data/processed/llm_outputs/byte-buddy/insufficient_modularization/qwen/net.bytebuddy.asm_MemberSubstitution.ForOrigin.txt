    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForOrigin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 fields (nof=6) but no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating it may be a data-only class or incomplete implementation. With only 266 lines of code (loc=266) and no method complexity, the class does not exhibit high complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The lack of methods and low field count suggest this is not a case of insufficient modularization but rather a simple data structure or utility class."
