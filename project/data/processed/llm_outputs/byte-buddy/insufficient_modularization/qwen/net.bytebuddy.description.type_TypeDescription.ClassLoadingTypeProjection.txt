    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0), 83 lines of code (loc=83), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate that the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit the characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
