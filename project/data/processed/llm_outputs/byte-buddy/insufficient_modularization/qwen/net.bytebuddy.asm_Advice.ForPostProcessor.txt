    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForPostProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 11 lines of code (loc=11) and zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0). The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies suggest this class is not actively used or interacting with other components, indicating it may be a simple data holder or unused class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
