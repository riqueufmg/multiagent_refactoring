{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.DefaultMethodCall",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods (nom=9) and 12 weighted method count (wmc=12), which is within acceptable limits for a single class. The lines of code (loc=148) is reasonable for the functionality provided. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest proper encapsulation. The LCOM value of 0.556 indicates reasonable cohesion, and the class manages a coherent set of responsibilities related to default method calls."
