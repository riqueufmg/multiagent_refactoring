{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Collector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 302 lines of code (loc) which is excessively high for a single class, indicating it contains too much implementation complexity. With 10 fields (nof) and no methods (nom), the class appears to be a data-heavy class that lacks proper decomposition into smaller, more focused components. The high line count combined with the field-to-method ratio suggests insufficient modularization where the class could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more manageable modules."
