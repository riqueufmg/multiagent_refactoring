    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal fields (nof=2), and low lines of code (loc=56). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating no method complexity. With such minimal functionality and low complexity, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, well-contained component."
