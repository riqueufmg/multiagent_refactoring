    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 41 lines of code (loc=41). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While it has a dependency on JavaDispatcher, the class itself is minimal and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, focused component."
