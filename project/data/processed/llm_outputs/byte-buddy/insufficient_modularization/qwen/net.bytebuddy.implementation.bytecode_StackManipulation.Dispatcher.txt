{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 12 lines of code (loc=12). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion. Given the extremely small size and low complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly decomposed."
