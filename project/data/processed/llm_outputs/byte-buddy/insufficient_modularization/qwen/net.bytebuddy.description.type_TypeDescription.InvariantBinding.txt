    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.InvariantBinding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 22 lines of code (loc), 1 field (nof), 0 methods (nom), and a Weighted Method Count (wmc) of 0. The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity metrics, indicates that further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple structure and limited functionality."
