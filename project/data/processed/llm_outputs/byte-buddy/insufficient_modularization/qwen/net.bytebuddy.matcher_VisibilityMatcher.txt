    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.VisibilityMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with a low weighted method count (wmc=3), indicating low complexity. The lines of code (loc=26) are minimal, suggesting the class is already well-decomposed and focused. The lack of class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0) and low coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate a simple, well-isolated class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
