    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RepeatedAnnotationPlugin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 4 public), low lines of code (74), low weighted method count (6), and good cohesion (LCOM = 1.0). These metrics indicate the class is reasonably small and well-structured, not warranting further decomposition."
