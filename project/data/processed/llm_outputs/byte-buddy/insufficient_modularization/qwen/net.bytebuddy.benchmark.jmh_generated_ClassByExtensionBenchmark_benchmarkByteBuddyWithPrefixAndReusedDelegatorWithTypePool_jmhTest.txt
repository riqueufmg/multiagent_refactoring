    "detection": false,
    "justification": "This class has only 9 methods (nom=9) and 263 lines of code (loc=276), with a relatively low weighted method count (wmc=42). The class appears to be a generated JMH benchmark test class with a single responsibility - benchmarking a specific byte buddy operation. The low number of methods and reasonable size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class lacks complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
