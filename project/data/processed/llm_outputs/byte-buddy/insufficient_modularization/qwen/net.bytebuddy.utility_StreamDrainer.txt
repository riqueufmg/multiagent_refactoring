    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.StreamDrainer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with low complexity (wmc=6), 5 fields (nof=5) and 67 lines of code (loc=67). The low number of methods and fields, combined with the manageable size and complexity, indicates sufficient modularization. LCOM value of 0.667 suggests reasonable cohesion within the class."
