{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 35 lines of code. The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex business logic class that would benefit from modularization."
