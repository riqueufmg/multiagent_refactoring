    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively low number of methods (9 total, 8 public), low complexity (WMC=42), and reasonable size (275 LOC). While the class has many fields (263), this appears to be characteristic of generated benchmark test classes rather than poor modularization. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies suggests it's a self-contained generated test class. No clear indication of insufficient modularization as the class seems appropriately scoped for its benchmark testing purpose."
