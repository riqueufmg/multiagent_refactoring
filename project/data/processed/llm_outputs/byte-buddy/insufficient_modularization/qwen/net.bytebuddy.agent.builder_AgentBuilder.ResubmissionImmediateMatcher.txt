    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 158 lines of code (loc=158). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and simple field structure suggests it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
