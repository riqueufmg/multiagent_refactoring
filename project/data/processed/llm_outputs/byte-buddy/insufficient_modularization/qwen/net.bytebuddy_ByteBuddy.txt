{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (52 total, 50 public), a large size (898 lines of code), and a high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) of 59. It also has numerous dependencies (54 external dependencies listed), indicating high complexity and responsibility. These metrics suggest that the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
