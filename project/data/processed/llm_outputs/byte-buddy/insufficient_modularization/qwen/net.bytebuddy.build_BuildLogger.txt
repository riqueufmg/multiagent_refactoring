{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.BuildLogger",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) and 478 lines of code (loc=478), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=0) suggest it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The high line count relative to the number of methods suggests each method may be doing too much work, violating the principle of single responsibility."
