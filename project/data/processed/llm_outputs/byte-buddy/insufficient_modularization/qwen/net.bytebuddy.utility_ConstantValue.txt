    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 2 fields (nof=2), with a low lines of code count (loc=100). The weighted method count (wmc=2) indicates low complexity. While the class has 5 dependencies, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
