    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 method parameters (nopm), 0 complexity (wmc), and only 40 lines of code (loc). It also has minimal dependencies with only 3 external dependencies. The low metric values indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
