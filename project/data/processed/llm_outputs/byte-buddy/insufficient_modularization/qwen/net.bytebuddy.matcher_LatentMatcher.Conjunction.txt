    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher.Conjunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 34 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), no fields (nof=1), and no dependencies on other classes except for annotations and a single matcher dependency. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused component that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
