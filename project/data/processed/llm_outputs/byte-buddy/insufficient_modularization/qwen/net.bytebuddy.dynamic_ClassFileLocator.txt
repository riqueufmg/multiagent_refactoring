{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 43 fields (nof=43), 1670 lines of code (loc=1670), and 15 nested classes (nc=15), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=1) and very low WMC (wmc=1) suggest poor decomposition where functionality is likely embedded within nested classes or large field declarations rather than properly modularized methods. The high number of nested classes (15) and fields (43) without corresponding methods indicates insufficient modularization where the class has not been properly decomposed into smaller, more manageable components."
