    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.UsingJump",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 89 lines of code (loc=89). While the class has some dependencies on 4 other classes, the low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) suggests this is likely a data class or simple configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
