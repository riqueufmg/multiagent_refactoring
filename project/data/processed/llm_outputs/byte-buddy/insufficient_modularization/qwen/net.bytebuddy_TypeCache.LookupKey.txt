    "class": "net.bytebuddy.TypeCache.LookupKey",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields and 0 methods, with a very low LOC of 39. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or key class with insufficient complexity to exhibit insufficient modularization."
