{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.RedefinitionListenable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 13 fields (nof=13) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively low lines of code count (loc=451). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0) indicating minimal method complexity. The Depth of Inheritance Tree is 1 (dit=1) showing no inheritance hierarchy issues. While the class has substantial lines of code, the low number of methods and fields suggests it may be a data-only class or interface rather than a complex implementation that needs further decomposition."
