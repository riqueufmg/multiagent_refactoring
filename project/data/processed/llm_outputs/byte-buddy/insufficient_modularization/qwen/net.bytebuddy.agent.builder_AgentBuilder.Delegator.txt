{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Delegator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 316 lines of code (loc), which is excessively large for a single class. The class contains 0 methods (nom) and 0 fields (nof), suggesting that the implementation details are likely embedded within anonymous classes or inner structures that are not captured by the metrics, indicating insufficient decomposition of functionality. The high lines of code without corresponding measurable methods suggests the class could benefit from further modularization to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
