    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithAccessor_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (276 LOC, 263 NOF), low complexity (WMC=42), and appropriate method count (9 NOM). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the lack of fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggests simple coupling. While the class has many fields (263 NOF), this is typical for JMH-generated benchmark test classes which often contain numerous generated fields for benchmark execution. The metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its purpose."
