    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForOrigin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 fields and 6 private fields, with 289 lines of code, indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient decomposition. The lack of methods (0 total, 0 private) combined with substantial field count and LOC suggests this class could benefit from further modularization to reduce implementation complexity."
