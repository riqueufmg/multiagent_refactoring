    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 1 field (nof=1), and 26 lines of code (loc=26). The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, indicating low complexity. With only 3 methods and minimal complexity, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
