{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.NodeList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 42 lines of code (loc=42). It also has minimal dependencies on only 2 external classes. The low number of methods and low complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
