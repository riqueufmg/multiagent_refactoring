    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 1 field (nof=1), and only 41 lines of code (loc=41). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No significant functional responsibilities are evident that would benefit from modularization."
