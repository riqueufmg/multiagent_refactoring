    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.Stream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 10 lines of code (loc=10). The lack of methods results in minimal implementation complexity (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies on other classes within the provided data that would indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple, minimal implementation that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
