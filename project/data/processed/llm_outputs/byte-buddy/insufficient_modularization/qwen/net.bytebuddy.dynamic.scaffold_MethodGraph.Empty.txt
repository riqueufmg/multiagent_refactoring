    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and 0 complexity (wmc=0, nc=0), indicating it is a minimal implementation class. With only 55 lines of code (loc=55) and no internal complexity or dependencies, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed for its purpose as an empty implementation."
