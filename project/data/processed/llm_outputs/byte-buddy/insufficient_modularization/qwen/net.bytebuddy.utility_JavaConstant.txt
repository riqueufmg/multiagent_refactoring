{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (28) and a large size in terms of lines of code (1907 LOC), indicating high implementation complexity. The class also has a high number of dependencies (27) suggesting it encompasses multiple responsibilities. The lack of methods (only 2) relative to its size and field count suggests insufficient decomposition into smaller, more manageable units."
