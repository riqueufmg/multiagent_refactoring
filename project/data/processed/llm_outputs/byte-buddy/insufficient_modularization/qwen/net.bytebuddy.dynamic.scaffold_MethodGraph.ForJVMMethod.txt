    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.ForJVMMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 50 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond MethodDescription. The low metrics suggest the class is already sufficiently decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
