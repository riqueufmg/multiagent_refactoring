    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 fields (nof=8) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 421 lines of code (loc=421). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of fields, the lack of methods and low structural complexity (wmc=0, nc=0) indicates this is likely a simple data holder or value object rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further modularization."
