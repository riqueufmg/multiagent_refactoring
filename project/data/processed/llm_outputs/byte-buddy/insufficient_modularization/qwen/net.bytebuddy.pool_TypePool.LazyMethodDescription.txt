    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyMethodDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 fields (nof=24) and 504 lines of code (loc=504), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient decomposition. The class likely contains too much responsibility and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
