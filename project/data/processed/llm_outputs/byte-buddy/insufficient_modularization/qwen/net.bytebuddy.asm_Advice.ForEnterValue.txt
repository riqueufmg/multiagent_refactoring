    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForEnterValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 116 lines of code (loc=116). While the class has multiple dependencies (7 external dependencies), the low method count and moderate field count do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a data-only or configuration class rather than a complex business logic class that would benefit from further decomposition."
