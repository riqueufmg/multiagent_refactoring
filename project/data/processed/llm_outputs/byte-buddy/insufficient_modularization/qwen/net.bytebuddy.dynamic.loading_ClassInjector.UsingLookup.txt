    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingLookup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 148 lines of code (loc=148). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of fields, the lack of methods and low structural complexity (wmc=0, nc=0) indicates this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further modularization."
