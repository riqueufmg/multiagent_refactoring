{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ArgumentProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 fields (nof=28) and 898 lines of code (loc=898), indicating high complexity and insufficient decomposition. The high number of fields suggests multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes. With no methods (nom=0) but significant LOC and field count, this indicates the class likely contains complex logic or data structures that warrant further modularization to improve maintainability and reduce complexity."
