    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.FrameComputingClassWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 55 lines of code (loc=55). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
