    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code in methods (wmc=0), and only 36 lines of code total (loc=36). With no methods implemented and minimal code, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly simplified."
