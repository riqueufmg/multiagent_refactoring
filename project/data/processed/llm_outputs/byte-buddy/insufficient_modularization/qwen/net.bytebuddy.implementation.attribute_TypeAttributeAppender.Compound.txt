    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.TypeAttributeAppender.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=39 but this appears to be file-level not class-level), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low complexity indicates insufficient data to determine insufficient modularization, and the class appears to be a simple compound implementation that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
