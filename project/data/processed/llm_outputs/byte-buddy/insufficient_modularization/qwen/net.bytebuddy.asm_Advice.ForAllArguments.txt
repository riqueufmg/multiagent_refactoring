    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForAllArguments",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 fields (nof=9) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a moderate size of 145 lines of code (loc=145). While the class has multiple dependencies (10 external dependencies), the low method count and reasonable field count do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a data-focused component with minimal behavior, which is appropriately decomposed for its purpose."
