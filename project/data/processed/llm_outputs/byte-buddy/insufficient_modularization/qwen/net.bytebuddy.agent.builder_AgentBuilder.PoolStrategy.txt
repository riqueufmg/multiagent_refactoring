    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.PoolStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 fields (nof=8) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 287 lines of code (loc=287). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, this appears to be an interface or abstract class with minimal implementation. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics (wmc=0) suggest this is a simple structural definition rather than a complex class requiring decomposition. The fanin and fanout values are also zero, indicating minimal coupling."
