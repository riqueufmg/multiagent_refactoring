    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lines of code (loc=67) are relatively low and the class appears to be a specialized inner class with minimal responsibilities. There is insufficient evidence of high complexity or large size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
