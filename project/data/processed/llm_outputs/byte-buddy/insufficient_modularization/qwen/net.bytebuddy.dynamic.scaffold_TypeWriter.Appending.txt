    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Appending",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 fields (nof=12) and 407 lines of code (loc=407), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential issues with decomposition. With 7 dependencies and high LOC count, this class likely contains too much responsibility and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
