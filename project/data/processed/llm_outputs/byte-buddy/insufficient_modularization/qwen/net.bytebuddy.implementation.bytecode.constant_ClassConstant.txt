    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.ClassConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 4 methods (nom=4) and weighted method count of 13 (wmc=13), which is within acceptable limits for a single class. The lines of code (loc=139) is reasonable for a class with bytecode manipulation responsibilities. The lack of class hierarchy (dit=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest proper modularization. The high LCOM value (0.75) indicates good cohesion within the class."
