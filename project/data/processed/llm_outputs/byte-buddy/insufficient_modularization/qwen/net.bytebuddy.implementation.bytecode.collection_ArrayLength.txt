    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayLength",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 20 lines of code (loc=20), which indicates a very small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is also very low, suggesting minimal complexity. With no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies, this class appears to be properly modularized with a single, well-defined responsibility."
