{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Discarding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 33 lines of code (loc=33). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class may be a nested class, its size and complexity are already minimal, so no further decomposition would be beneficial."
