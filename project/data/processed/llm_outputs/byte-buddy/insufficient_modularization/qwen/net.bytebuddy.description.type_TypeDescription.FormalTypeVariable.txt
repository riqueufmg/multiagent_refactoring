    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. There are no dependencies on other classes within the provided data, and the class appears to be a simple, well-contained entity with no evidence of insufficient modularization."
