    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.OfPrimitiveArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), and 60 lines of code. The Weighted Methods per Class is 0 (wmc=0) and Lack of Cohesion is -1.0 (lcom=-1.0) which indicates good cohesion. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already quite simple and decomposed."
