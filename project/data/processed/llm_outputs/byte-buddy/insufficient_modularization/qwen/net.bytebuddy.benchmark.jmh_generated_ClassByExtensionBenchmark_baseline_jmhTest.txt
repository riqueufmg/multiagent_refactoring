    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 263 fields (nof=263) which is high, but this is typical for JMH-generated benchmark classes that contain many state fields for performance testing. The WMC of 42 indicates moderate complexity, and only 9 methods (nom=9) with 8 private methods (nopm=8) suggest reasonable method distribution. The LCOM of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the class appears to be a generated benchmark test class rather than a manually crafted class requiring decomposition."
