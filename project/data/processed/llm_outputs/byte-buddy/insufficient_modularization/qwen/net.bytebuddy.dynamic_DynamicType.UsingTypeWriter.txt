    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.UsingTypeWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 41 lines of code, zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0), and zero fan-in/fan-out dependencies. The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No evidence of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
