    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_jmhType_B1",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fanin/fanout indicating no dependencies, and only 18 lines of code (loc=18). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class has 256 fields (nof=256), this appears to be generated code structure rather than complex implementation logic that would benefit from decomposition. The low method count and minimal complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
