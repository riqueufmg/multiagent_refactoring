    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription.InGenericShape",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 9 lines of code (loc=9). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While it has a dependency on MethodDescription, the class itself is minimal and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed."
