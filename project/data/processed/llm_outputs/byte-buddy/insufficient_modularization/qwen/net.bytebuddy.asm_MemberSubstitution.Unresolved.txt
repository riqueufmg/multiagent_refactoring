{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Unresolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 19 lines of code (loc=19). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies on other classes (fanout=0). This indicates a minimal, focused class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed."
