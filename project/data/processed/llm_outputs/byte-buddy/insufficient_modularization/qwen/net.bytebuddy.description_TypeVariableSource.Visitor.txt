{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource.Visitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 37 lines of code (loc=37). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal complexity. While it has one dependency on MethodDescription, the class itself is extremely simple and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
