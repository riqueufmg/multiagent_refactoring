{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy.Trivial",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=69 but this appears to be the file loc not class loc), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and complexity indicates insufficient material for further meaningful decomposition, making it a simple, well-modularized class rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
