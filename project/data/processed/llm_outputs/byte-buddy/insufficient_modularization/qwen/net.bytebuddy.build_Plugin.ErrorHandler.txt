{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ErrorHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and reasonable size (loc=319). While the lines of code are somewhat high, the lack of methods and complexity metrics suggest this is likely a simple data class or interface rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The WMC of 0 and absence of any methods indicate minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from modularization."
