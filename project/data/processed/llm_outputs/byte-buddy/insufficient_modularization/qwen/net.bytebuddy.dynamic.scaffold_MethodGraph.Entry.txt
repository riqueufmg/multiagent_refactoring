{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Entry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 fields (nof=17) and 463 lines of code (loc=463), indicating high complexity and insufficient decomposition. The class embeds multiple dependencies including MethodDescription, MethodGraph, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and Visibility, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. With no methods (nom=0) but high field count and LOC, the class appears to be a data-heavy structure that could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
