{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.Implicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple, lightweight class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed."
