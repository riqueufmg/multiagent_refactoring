    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.MethodVisitorWrapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (loc=17, wmc=0, nom=0) and no internal dependencies, indicating it is already well-decomposed and minimal in size and complexity. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately sized and structured."
