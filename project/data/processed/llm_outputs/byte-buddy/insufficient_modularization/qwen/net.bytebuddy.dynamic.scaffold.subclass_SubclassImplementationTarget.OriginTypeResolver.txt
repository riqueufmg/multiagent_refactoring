    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.SubclassImplementationTarget.OriginTypeResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 26 lines of code (loc=26). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple data holder or enum-like structure with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
