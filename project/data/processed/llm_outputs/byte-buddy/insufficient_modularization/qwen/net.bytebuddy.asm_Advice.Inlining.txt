{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Inlining",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 41 fields (nof=41) and 895 lines of code (loc=895), indicating high size and complexity. With no methods (nom=0) but many dependencies (10 external dependencies listed), this suggests the class contains significant implementation logic but lacks proper decomposition into smaller, focused components. The high field count and large code size without corresponding methods indicates insufficient modularization where the class could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more manageable modules."
