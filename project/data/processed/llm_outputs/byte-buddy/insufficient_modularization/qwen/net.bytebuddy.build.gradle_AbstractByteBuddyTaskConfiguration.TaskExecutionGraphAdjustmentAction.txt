    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTaskConfiguration.TaskExecutionGraphAdjustmentAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7), 0 methods (nom=0), and 69 lines of code (loc=69). While the class has a single dependency on 'net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Adjustment', the metrics indicate it is a relatively simple class with minimal complexity (wmc=0, nc=0). The lack of methods suggests it may be a data-only class or configuration holder rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity to warrant further modularization."
