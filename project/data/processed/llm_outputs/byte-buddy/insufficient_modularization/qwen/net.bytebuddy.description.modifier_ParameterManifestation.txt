    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5), low complexity (WMC=5), and reasonable size (46 LOC). While LCOM is high (0.8), indicating some cohesion issues, the overall size and complexity are not excessive. The class appears to be a simple enumeration or constant class with minimal functionality that doesn't warrant further decomposition."
