{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithDiscardedEnterType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 29 lines of code (loc=29). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class depends on 2 external classes, its size and complexity are already minimal, making further decomposition unnecessary and potentially harmful to maintainability."
