    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.ForBeanProperty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 47 lines of code and all metrics indicating minimal functionality (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0). The lack of methods and fields suggests this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
