    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.MethodBinding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 fields (nof=10) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 174 lines of code (loc=174). While the class has a moderate number of fields, the low method count and single inheritance level (dit=1) indicate it is already well-decomposed. The lack of methods suggests this is likely a data holder or configuration class rather than a complex business logic class that would benefit from further modularization."
