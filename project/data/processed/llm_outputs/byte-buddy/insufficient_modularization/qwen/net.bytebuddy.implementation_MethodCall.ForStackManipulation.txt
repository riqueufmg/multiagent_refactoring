    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForStackManipulation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 72 lines of code (loc=72). The lack of methods and low complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition is not warranted, as the class is already minimally complex and does not contain sufficient functionality to justify additional modularization."
