```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin.AccessControlWrapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 92 lines of code (loc=92). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on 7 other classes, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) indicates this is likely a data-only class or wrapper, which is appropriately simple. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
