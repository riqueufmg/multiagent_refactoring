    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Symbolic",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 191 lines of code (loc=191). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is a simple data holder or symbolic representation rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The low number of dependencies (6) and absence of any fan-in or fan-out connections indicate limited scope and responsibility."
