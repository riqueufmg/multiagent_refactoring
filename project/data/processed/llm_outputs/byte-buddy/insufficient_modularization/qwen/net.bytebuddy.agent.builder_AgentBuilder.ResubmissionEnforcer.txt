{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ResubmissionEnforcer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 27 lines of code (loc=27). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies. This indicates a minimal class that does not require further decomposition."
