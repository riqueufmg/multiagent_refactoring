{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer.Substitutable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 136 lines of code (loc=136). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class has dependencies on 7 other classes, this is not excessive given its role as a substitutable component in a bytecode manipulation framework. The low method count and minimal complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
