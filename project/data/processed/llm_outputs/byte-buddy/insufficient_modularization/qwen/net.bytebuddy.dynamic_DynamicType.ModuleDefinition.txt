    "justification": "The class has 524 lines of code (loc) which indicates high implementation complexity and size. The class contains multiple responsibilities as evidenced by its dependencies on TypeList, ModifierContributor, and TypeDescription, suggesting it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
