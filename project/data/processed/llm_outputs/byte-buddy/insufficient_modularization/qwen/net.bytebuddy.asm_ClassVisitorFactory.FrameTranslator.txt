    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.FrameTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 79 lines of code (loc=79). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and simple field structure suggests it is already sufficiently modularized for its current functionality. The class appears to be a lightweight data holder or simple utility class rather than a complex entity requiring further decomposition."
