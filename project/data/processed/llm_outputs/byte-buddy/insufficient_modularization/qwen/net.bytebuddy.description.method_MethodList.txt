    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4) and 4 method invocations (wmc=4), indicating simple implementation. The lines of code (loc=275) include necessary functionality for a list implementation. The class has minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and reasonable depth of inheritance (dit=1). The low number of methods and simple complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
