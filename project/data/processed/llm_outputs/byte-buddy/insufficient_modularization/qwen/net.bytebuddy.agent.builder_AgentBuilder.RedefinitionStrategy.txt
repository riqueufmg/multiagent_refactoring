    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.RedefinitionStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 77 fields (nof=77) and 2097 lines of code (loc=2097), indicating excessive size and complexity that suggests insufficient modularization. The high number of fields suggests the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused components to reduce its implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
