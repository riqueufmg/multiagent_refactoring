    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal lines of code (loc=59), no fields (nof=2, nopf=0), and no coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0, wmc=0). The low number of methods and minimal size indicate it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
