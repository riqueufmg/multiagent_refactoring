    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldRegistry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2) and 11 fields (nof=11), with 228 lines of code (loc=228). While the class has a moderate number of fields, the low method count and cyclomatic complexity suggest it is reasonably well-modularized. The class appears to be a focused registry implementation with appropriate responsibilities for field management."
