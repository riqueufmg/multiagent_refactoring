{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ExportsDefinitionAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 49 lines of code (loc=49), and minimal dependencies on only 2 external classes. The lack of methods (nopm=0, nom=0, wmc=0) indicates it is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The low field count and absence of any complex behavior metrics suggest this class is already sufficiently modularized for its intended purpose."
