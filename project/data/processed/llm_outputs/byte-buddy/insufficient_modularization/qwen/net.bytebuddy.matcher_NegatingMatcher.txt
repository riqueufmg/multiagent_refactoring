    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.NegatingMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with all being public (nopm=3), indicating proper encapsulation. The lines of code (loc=26) are minimal and appropriate for a simple negating matcher implementation. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate a well-focused, single-responsibility class that is appropriately modularized."
