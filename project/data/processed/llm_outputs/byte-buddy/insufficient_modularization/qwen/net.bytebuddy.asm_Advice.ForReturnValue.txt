    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForReturnValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof: 5) and 0 methods (nom: 0), with 92 lines of code (loc: 92). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex business logic class that would benefit from modularization."
