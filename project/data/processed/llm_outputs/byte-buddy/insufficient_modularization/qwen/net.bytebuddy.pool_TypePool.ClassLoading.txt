    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 65 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), no fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and no inheritance (dit=0). The low method count and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization for this class's purpose as an inner class handling type pool class loading functionality."
