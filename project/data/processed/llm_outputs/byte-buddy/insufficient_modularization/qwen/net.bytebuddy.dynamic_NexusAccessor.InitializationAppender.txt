    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor.InitializationAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 27 lines of code (loc=27). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0). The low number of dependencies (8) and lack of inheritance (dit=1) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused component with minimal complexity that does not require further decomposition."
