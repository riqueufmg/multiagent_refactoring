    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Resolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 fields (nof=10) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 178 lines of code (loc=178). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics indicate this is likely a simple data structure or interface rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The class does not exhibit characteristics of insufficient modularization as it appears to be appropriately sized and structured."
