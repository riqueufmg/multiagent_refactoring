    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4) and 43 lines of code (loc=43). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=4), indicating simple method implementations. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
