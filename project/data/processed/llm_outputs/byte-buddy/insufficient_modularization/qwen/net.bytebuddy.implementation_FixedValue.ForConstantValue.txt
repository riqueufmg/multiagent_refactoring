    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 65 lines of code (loc=65). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal method complexity. The class appears to be a simple, focused implementation with no signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains a clear single responsibility."
