    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is already fully decomposed. With only 18 lines of code (loc=18) and no complexity (wmc=0), the class represents a minimal implementation that cannot be further decomposed. The lack of any methods or fields suggests this is a marker or placeholder class that serves a specific purpose without requiring internal structure."
