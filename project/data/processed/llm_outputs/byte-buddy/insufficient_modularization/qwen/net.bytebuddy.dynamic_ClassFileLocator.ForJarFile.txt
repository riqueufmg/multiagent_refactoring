{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForJarFile",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 181 lines of code (loc=181). While the LOC is moderately high for a class with few methods, the low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. The WMC of 0 suggests low complexity, and the negative LCOM value indicates good cohesion. The class does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, focused class with appropriate decomposition."
