    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Mandate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. The lack of fields (nof=1) and parameters (nopf=0, nopm=4) indicates simple structure. While the LCOM value of 0.8 suggests some cohesion issues, the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization given the class's small scale."
