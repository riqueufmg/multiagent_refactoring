    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription.Loadable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 41 lines of code (loc=41). It also has minimal dependencies with fanin=0 and fanout=0. The low number of methods and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
