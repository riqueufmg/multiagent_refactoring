{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 63 lines of code (loc=63). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and very limited functionality suggests this is likely an abstract base class or data holder rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate it has not grown complex enough to require further decomposition."
