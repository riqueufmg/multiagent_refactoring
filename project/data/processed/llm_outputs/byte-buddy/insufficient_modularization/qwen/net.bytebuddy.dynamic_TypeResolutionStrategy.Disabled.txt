    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy.Disabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and minimal lines of code (loc=25). The WMC (Weighted Method Count) is 0, indicating no method complexity. The DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) is 1, showing it's a simple class with no inheritance hierarchy. LCOM is -1.0 which typically indicates good cohesion or minimal complexity. The class appears to be a simple, well-modularized entity with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
