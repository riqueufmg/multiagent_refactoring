    "justification": "Class has very low complexity with only 16 lines of code, zero methods (nom=0), zero fields (nof=0), and zero complexity metrics (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or marker class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it lacks the complexity that would require further decomposition."
