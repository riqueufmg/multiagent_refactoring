    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForLocalValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 0 methods, with 78 lines of code. While the LOC count is moderate, the lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) indicate this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple nature and purpose."
