    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=3, NOM=3, LCOM=-1.0) and reasonable size (LOC=437). While the class has 12 fields, the low number of methods and low cyclomatic complexity suggest the implementation is not overly complex. The negative LCOM value indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
