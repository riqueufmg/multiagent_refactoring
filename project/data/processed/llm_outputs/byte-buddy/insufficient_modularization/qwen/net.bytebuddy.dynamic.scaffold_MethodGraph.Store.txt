{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Store",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 fields (nof=19) and 617 lines of code (loc=617), indicating high size and complexity. With no methods (nom=0) but 19 fields, this suggests the class is likely a data-heavy structure that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused components. The high field count combined with substantial LOC suggests insufficient modularization where related data and functionality could be grouped into separate cohesive units."
