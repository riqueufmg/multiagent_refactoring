    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 32 fields (nof=32), 21 methods (nom=21), and 1127 lines of code (loc=1127), indicating high size and complexity. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 30 (wmc=30), suggesting high implementation complexity. The class also has a high number of dependencies (17 listed), which indicates it has multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and complexity."
