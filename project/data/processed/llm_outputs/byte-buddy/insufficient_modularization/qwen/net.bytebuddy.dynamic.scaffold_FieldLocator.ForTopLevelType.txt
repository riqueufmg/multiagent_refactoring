    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.ForTopLevelType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 28 lines of code (loc=28). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. There are no dependencies to other classes beyond its enclosing type, and no fan-in or fan-out relationships. The class appears to be a simple, lightweight nested class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it lacks the complexity that would require further decomposition."
