    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.PosixLibrary",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 fields and 111 lines of code which is relatively small. It has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) indicating it's likely a data-only class or interface. The low number of fields and absence of complex methods or high complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) suggest it's already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
