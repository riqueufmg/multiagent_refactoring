    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForComponentType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 44 lines of code (loc=44), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple component type descriptor with limited functionality."
