    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 16 lines of code (loc=16), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 class dependency (nc=1) and no fields (nof=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
