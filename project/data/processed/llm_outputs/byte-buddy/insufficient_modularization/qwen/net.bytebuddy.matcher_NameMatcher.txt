    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.NameMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3), 26 lines of code (loc=26), 1 field (nof=1), and no class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
