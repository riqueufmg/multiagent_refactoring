    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.NamedElement.WithOptionalName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 10 lines of code (loc=10). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0) and Lack of Cohesion metric is -1.0 (lcom=-1.0). These metrics indicate minimal complexity and size, suggesting the class is already sufficiently decomposed. There are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance hierarchy depth (dit=1), further supporting that this is a simple, well-modularized component."
