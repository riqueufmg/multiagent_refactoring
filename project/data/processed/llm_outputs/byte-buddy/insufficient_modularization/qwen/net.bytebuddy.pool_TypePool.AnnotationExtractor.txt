    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.AnnotationExtractor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 fields (nof=8) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 141 lines of code (loc=141). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and field count do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data structure or value object rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
