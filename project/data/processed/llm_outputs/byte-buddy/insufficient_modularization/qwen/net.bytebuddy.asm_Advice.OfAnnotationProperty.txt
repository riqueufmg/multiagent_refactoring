    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), and 0 weighted method count (wmc). With only 57 lines of code (loc) and minimal dependencies, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, focused class with low implementation complexity that would not benefit from further decomposition."
