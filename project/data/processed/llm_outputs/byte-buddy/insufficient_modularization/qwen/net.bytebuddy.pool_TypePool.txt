{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 411 fields and 7626 lines of code, indicating a very large and complex implementation. It also contains a high number of dependencies (54), suggesting it handles numerous responsibilities. With only 2 methods and a WMC of 2, the complexity is likely concentrated in a few large methods or the class is poorly decomposed. The high number of inner classes and dependencies indicates insufficient modularization, as further decomposition could reduce its size and implementation complexity."
