    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy.MethodCall",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 87 lines of code (loc=87). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low complexity indicators suggest this is likely a simple data holder or auxiliary class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The low number of dependencies (6) and absence of inheritance (dit=1) further indicate this is a lightweight class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
