{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.EntryPoint",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0) and 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=0), with a low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=2). The lines of code (loc=127) are reasonable for a class with this complexity. The class has no inheritance (dit=0) and negative LCOM (-1.0) suggests cohesive design. The low number of methods and complexity metrics indicate proper modularization without need for further decomposition."
