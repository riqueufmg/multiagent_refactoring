{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.OfConstructorParameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 41 lines of code (loc). The low number of fields (3) and absence of dependencies to other classes beyond its outer class and a build annotation suggest it is already well modularized. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be a simple, focused inner class with minimal responsibilities."
