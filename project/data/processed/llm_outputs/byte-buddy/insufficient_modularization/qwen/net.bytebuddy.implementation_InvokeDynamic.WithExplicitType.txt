    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.WithExplicitType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and only 28 lines of code (loc=28). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods or significant functionality, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly decomposed or represents a simple data holder."
