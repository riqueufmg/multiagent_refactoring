    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 154 lines of code which is not excessively large, but more importantly, the metrics show 0 fields (nof), 0 public fields (nopf), 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), and 0 weighted method count (wmc). The lack of any methods or fields indicates this class is likely an empty or placeholder class that doesn't exhibit complexity requiring further decomposition. Without any internal structure or behavior, there is no basis for insufficient modularization."
