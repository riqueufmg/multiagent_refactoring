    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 41 lines of code (loc). With minimal functionality and low complexity, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately simple and focused."
