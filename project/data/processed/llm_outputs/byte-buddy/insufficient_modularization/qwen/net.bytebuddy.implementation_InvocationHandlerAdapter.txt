{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 fields (nof=17), 10 methods (nom=10), and 339 lines of code (loc=339). It also has a high number of dependencies (21 external dependencies) and a WMC of 12, indicating moderate complexity. The combination of high LOC, significant number of fields, and multiple dependencies suggests that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
