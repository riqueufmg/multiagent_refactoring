    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 30 lines of code and all metrics indicating minimal functionality (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion. Given the minimal size and complexity, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
