    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.TransformationLogger",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 31 lines of code (loc=31). It also has minimal dependencies with only 1 fan-out dependency. The low complexity metrics and small size indicate this class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
