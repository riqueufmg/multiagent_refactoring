```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyParameterList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low LOC count (34). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While it has 3 dependencies, the class itself shows minimal internal complexity and size that would warrant further decomposition. The metrics suggest this is already a highly simplified class rather than one suffering from insufficient modularization."
