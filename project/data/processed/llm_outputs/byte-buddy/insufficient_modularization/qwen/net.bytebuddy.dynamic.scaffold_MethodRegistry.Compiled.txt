    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 fields (nof: 12) but no methods (nom: 0, nopm: 0), which suggests it may be a data-only class or interface rather than a complex implementation that needs decomposition. The low method count and absence of complexity metrics (wmc: 0, nc: 0) indicate this is likely a simple structural class rather than one suffering from insufficient modularization."
