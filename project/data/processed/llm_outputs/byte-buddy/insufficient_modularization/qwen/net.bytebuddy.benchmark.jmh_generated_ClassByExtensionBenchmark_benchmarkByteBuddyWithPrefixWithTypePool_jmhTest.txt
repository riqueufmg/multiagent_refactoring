    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithPrefixWithTypePool_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a moderate size with 276 lines of code and 263 fields, but only 9 methods with 42 weighted method complexity. The low number of methods (9) and relatively low WMC (42) indicate the class is not overly complex in terms of behavior. The class appears to be a generated benchmark test class, which typically contains many fields for benchmark configuration but maintains focused behavior. LCOM of 0.0 suggests good cohesion among the methods and attributes."
