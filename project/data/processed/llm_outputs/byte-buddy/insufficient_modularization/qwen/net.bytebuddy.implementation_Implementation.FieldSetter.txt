{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.FieldSetter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 79 lines of code (loc=79). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity. While the class has dependencies on 7 other classes, this is not excessive given its role as a field setter implementation. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
