    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTask",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom) and 6 fields (nof) with 172 lines of code (loc). While the class has moderate complexity with a WMC of 15, the LCOM value of 0.23 suggests reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be a Gradle task implementation with a focused responsibility for byte buddy processing. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
