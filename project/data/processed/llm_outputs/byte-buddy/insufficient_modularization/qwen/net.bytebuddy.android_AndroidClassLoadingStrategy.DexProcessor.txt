    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.DexProcessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 fields (nof=14) and 279 lines of code (loc=279), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential issues with decomposition, as a class of this size should typically contain multiple methods to handle its responsibilities. The high field count combined with substantial LOC suggests insufficient modularization where further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
