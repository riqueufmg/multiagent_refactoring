{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 18 lines of code (loc=18). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating no method complexity. The class appears to be a simple marker or placeholder class with minimal responsibilities, which is appropriate for its design. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already appropriately small and simple."
