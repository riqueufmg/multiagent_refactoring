    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.specimen.ExampleInterface",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18) and 131 lines of code (loc=131), which while somewhat large, does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization. The weighted method count (wmc=18) matches the number of methods, indicating simple method complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this appears to be a simple interface specification rather than a complex class requiring decomposition. The lack of implementation complexity and relatively straightforward structure suggests adequate modularization for its purpose."
