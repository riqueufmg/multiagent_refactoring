{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTaskExtension",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 360 lines of code (loc), 38 methods (nom) with 31 private methods (nopm), and a weighted method count (wmc) of 41, indicating high implementation complexity. The high number of methods and lines of code suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity. The class also has multiple responsibilities as indicated by its dependencies on various components (Transformation, Discovery, ObjectFactory, Adjustment, EntryPoint), suggesting insufficient modularization."
