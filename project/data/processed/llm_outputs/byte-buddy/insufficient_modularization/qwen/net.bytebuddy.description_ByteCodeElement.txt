    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2), 103 lines of code which is reasonable for a base class, and only 2 fields (nof=1, nc=2). The class appears to be a foundational element in the hierarchy (dit=1) with minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low method count and simple structure do not indicate insufficient modularization."
