    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.DynamicClassLoader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 244 lines of code (loc=244). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and field count do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
