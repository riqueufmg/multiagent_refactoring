{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.ForApi26LevelCompatibleVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 0 attributes (nof=2 but nopf=0 indicates no public fields), and only 44 lines of code (loc=44). The lack of methods and low LOC suggests minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. LCOM value of -1.0 indicates good cohesion, and the absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests no external coupling issues."
