    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AnnotationRemoval",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17) with 16 private methods (nopm=16), indicating high implementation complexity concentrated within the class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=22) suggests significant functional complexity. With 21 fields (nof=21) and 379 lines of code (loc=379), the class is large and manages substantial state. The high number of private methods relative to total methods suggests cohesive but complex internal implementation that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The class has substantial responsibilities as evidenced by its dependencies on 12 other classes, indicating it orchestrates multiple concerns that could be separated."
