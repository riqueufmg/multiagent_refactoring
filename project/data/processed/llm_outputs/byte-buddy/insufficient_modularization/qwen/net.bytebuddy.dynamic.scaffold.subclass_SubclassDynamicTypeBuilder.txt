{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.SubclassDynamicTypeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods (nom=6) and 106 lines of code (loc=106), with a weighted method count of 8 (wmc=8). It also has a high number of dependencies (24 external dependencies) which indicates high complexity and responsibility. The combination of moderate method count, significant lines of code, and high dependency count suggests that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
