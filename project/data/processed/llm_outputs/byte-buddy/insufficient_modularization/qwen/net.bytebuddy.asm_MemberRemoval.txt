{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberRemoval",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (118 LOC, 7 methods, 6 fields) and reasonable complexity (WMC=9). While it has multiple dependencies (12 external classes), this is typical for bytecode manipulation libraries. The LCOM value of 0.286 suggests reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be a cohesive unit responsible for member removal functionality in the bytecode manipulation context, and further decomposition would likely not significantly improve modularity."
