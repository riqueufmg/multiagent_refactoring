{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.MultipleParentClassLoader.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), no methods (nom=0), and relatively small size with 179 lines of code (loc=179). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. While the class has some dependencies (fanout=0 shows no outgoing dependencies but dependencies list shows 2 external dependencies), the low internal complexity and small method count do not indicate insufficient modularization."
