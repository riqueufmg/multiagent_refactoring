    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner.OfSimpleType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0, wmc=0) and only 61 lines of code (loc=61). The lack of methods and low line count indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, lightweight component with limited responsibilities."
