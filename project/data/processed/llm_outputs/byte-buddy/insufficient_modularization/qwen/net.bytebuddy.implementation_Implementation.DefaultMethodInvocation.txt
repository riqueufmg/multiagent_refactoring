    "justification": "The class has 35 lines of code but no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) or fields (nof=0, nopf=0), suggesting it may be an interface or abstract class. Without concrete implementation complexity metrics (wmc=0) and with minimal dependencies (2 external dependencies), there is insufficient evidence of excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
