    "justification": "The class has 193 lines of code (loc=193) which indicates high implementation complexity, and it depends on 5 different classes suggesting multiple responsibilities. The lack of methods (nom=0) and fields (nof=7) suggests potential insufficient modularization where further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
