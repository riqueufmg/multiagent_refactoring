    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4), 0 methods (nom=0), and 90 lines of code (loc=90). While the LOC is moderately high for a class with no methods, the low number of fields and methods suggests it may be a data-only class or simple container rather than a complex class needing decomposition. Without evidence of high complexity or numerous responsibilities, insufficient modularization cannot be confirmed."
