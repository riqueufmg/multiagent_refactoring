    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.enumeration.EnumerationDescription.Latent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 43 lines of code (loc=43), and cyclomatic complexity of 0 (wmc=0). While the class has low cohesion (lcom=-1.0), the metrics indicate a very small and simple class that does not warrant further decomposition. The lack of methods and low field count suggest this is already a sufficiently modularized component."
