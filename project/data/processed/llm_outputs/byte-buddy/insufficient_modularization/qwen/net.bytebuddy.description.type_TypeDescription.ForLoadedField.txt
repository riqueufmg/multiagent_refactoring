    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 38 lines of code (loc). With only 2 fields (nof) and 0 public fields (nopf), the class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
