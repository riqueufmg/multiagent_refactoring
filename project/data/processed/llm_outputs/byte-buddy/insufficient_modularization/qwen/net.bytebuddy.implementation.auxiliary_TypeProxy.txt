    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 38 fields and 450 lines of code, indicating high size and potential complexity. It also contains multiple inner classes (SilentConstruction, Default, AbstractMethodErrorThrow, InvocationFactory) which suggests that the class could be further decomposed to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
