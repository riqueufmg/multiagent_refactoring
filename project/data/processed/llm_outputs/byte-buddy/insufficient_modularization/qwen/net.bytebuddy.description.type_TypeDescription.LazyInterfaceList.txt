{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.LazyInterfaceList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 42 lines of code (loc=42). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and simple field count indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a lightweight lazy-loading wrapper around TypeList dependencies, which is a reasonable level of responsibility."
