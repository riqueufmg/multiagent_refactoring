{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForDefinedMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 fields (nof=16) and 461 lines of code (loc=461), indicating high complexity and insufficient decomposition. The high number of fields suggests multiple responsibilities, while the substantial LOC count indicates the class is doing too much work without proper modularization. The class likely contains multiple cohesive groups of functionality that should be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
