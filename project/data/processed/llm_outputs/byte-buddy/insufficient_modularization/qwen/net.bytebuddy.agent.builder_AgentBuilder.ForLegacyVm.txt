{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForLegacyVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 13 lines of code (loc=13) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. This suggests the class is already sufficiently decomposed or is a simple data holder that does not require further modularization."
