    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), low WMC (0), and only 76 lines of code (loc=76). It has minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no class relationships (nc=0, dit=0). The low metric values indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
