    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 fields (nof=5), no methods (nom=0), 58 lines of code (loc=58), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
