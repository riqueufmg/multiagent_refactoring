    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=28 but this appears to be the file location rather than method count), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of fields (nof=1) and lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, well-encapsulated component."
