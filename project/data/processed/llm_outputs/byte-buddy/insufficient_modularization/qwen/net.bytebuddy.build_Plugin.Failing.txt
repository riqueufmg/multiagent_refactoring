    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely a marker interface or empty class. With minimal structural complexity and no behavioral complexity (wmc=0), there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already at its simplest form."
