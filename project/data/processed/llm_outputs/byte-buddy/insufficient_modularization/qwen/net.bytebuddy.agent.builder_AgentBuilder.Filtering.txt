{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Filtering",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 62 lines of code (loc=62). While the class has some dependencies on ElementMatcher and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, the low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. The absence of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
