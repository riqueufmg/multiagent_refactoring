    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and only 45 lines of code (loc=45). It has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no class hierarchy (dit=0). The low number of fields (nof=2) and lack of methods indicates this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class that is already sufficiently modularized."
