    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 63 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), no fields (nof=1), and no dependencies to other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
