    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0), WMC=0, and only 30 lines of code. The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. No significant complexity or size issues are present that would benefit from additional modularization."
