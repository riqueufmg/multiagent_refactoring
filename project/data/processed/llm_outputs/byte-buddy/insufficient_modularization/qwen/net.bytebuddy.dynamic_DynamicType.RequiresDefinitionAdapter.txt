    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 47 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal complexity. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, its current size and complexity are sufficiently low that further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits. The class appears to be a simple adapter with minimal responsibilities."
