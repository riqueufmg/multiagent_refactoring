    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 26 lines of code, zero methods (nom=0), zero fields (nof=0), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple container or configuration class rather than a complex implementation that needs modularization."
