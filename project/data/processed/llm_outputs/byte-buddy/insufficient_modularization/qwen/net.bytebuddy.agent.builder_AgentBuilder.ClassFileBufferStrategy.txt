    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is likely an interface or abstract class that serves as a structural definition rather than an implementation. With only 62 lines of code (loc=62) and no concrete methods (wmc=0), this class does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization as it is already minimally sized and does not contain complex implementations that would benefit from further decomposition."
