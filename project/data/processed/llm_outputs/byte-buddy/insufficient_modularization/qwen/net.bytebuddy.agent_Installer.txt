{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.Installer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5 total, 3 public), low complexity (WMC=10), and reasonable size (89 LOC). The LCOM value of 0.6 indicates good cohesion, and there are no dependencies to suggest coupling issues. The metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately decomposed for its current functionality."
