    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods with a WMC of 8, indicating low complexity. With only 265 lines of code and 16 fields, the class is of moderate size. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the single nested class (nc=1) suggests appropriate internal structure. The fanin and fanout values of 0 indicate limited external dependencies, which is acceptable for a benchmark class. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the current level of modularization appears sufficient given its moderate size and complexity metrics."
