    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 43 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no public methods or fields suggesting minimal interface exposure. The class appears to be a simple data holder or lazy initialization wrapper with appropriate size and complexity for its likely purpose."
