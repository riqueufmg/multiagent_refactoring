    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 fields (nof=9) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 197 lines of code (loc=197). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low number of fields and methods suggests reasonable modularization. Without additional structural complexity indicators or clear decomposition opportunities evident from the metrics provided, insufficient modularization cannot be confidently detected."
