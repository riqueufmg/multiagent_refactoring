{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.OfFormalTypeVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 14 lines of code (loc=14) and zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is already highly decomposed. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, suggesting minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple, well-factored component that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
