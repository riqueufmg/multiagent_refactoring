    "justification": "The class has 117 lines of code but all metrics (nof, nopf, nom, nopm, wmc, nc, dit, lcom, fanin, fanout) are zero or -1, indicating insufficient data to determine if modularization is insufficient. Without meaningful metrics showing high complexity or lack of decomposition, cannot detect this smell."
