    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Transformation.PluginResolvingClassLoader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 70 lines of code (loc=70). While the class has some size, the low number of fields and absence of methods suggest it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) indicate minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
