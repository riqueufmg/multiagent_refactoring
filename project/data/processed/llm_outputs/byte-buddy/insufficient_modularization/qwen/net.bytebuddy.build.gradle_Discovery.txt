```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Discovery",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7, wmc=7) and 60 lines of code (loc=60), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and absence of class hierarchy (dit=0) suggest simple complexity. While the LCOM value of 0.8571428571428571 indicates some cohesion issues, the overall size and complexity metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized for its current functionality."
