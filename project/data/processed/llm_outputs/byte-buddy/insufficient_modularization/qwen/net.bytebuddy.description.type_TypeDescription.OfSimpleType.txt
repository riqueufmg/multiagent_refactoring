    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.OfSimpleType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 226 lines of code (loc) which indicates substantial size, and it has 6 dependencies on other classes suggesting high complexity and potential responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The lack of methods (nom=0) and fields (nof=0) reported may indicate incomplete metric collection, but the substantial loc and dependencies suggest insufficient modularization."
