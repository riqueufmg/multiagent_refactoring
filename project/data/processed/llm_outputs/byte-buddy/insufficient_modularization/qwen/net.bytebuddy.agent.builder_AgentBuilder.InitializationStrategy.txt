```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.InitializationStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 354 lines of code (loc) which is excessively high for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality. It has 8 fields (nof=8) but no methods (nom=0), suggesting it may be holding too much state or data without proper behavioral decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0) combined with high line count suggests the class has not been properly decomposed into smaller, more focused components. The WMC of 0 and LCOM of -1.0 further indicate poor internal structure and cohesion issues typical of insufficient modularization."
