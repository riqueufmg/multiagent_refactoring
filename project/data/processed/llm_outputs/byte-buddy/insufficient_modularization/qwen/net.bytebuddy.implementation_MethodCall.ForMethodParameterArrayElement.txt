    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForMethodParameterArrayElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 122 lines of code (loc=122). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low number of fields and methods suggests it is already well-decomposed. The class appears to be a specialized inner class with focused responsibility, and there is no evidence of excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
