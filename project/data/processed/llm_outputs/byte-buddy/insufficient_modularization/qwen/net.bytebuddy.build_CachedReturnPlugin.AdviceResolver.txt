    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin.AdviceResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 153 lines of code (loc=153). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the metrics indicate this is likely a data-only class or configuration class rather than a complex implementation. The low method count and lack of complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) suggest this class is appropriately modularized for its purpose, and there's insufficient evidence of implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
