{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Trivial",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low lines of code (loc=61). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal complexity. While the class depends on MethodDescription, the metrics indicate it is already sufficiently decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
