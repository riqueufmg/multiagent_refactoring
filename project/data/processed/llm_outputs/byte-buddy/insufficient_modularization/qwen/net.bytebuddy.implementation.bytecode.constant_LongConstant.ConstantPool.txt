    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 23 lines of code (loc=23), and minimal dependencies. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low field count indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
