    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 8 public methods (nopm=8), indicating a focused responsibility. The weighted method count (wmc=13) and lines of code (loc=87) are relatively low, suggesting manageable complexity. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates limited coupling. The LCOM value (0.4444444444444444) suggests reasonable cohesion. The single field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0) indicate proper encapsulation. Overall, the metrics suggest appropriate modularization without excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
