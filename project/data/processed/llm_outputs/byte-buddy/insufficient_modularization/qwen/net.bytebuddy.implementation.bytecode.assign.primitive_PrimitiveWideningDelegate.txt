    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveWideningDelegate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 10 fields (nof=10), with a relatively low weighted method count (wmc=19) and lines of code (loc=178). The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies suggests it's not heavily interconnected. While the LCOM value of 0.667 indicates some cohesion issues, the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization to warrant decomposition."
