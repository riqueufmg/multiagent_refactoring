    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForFirstBinding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 52 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and no inheritance (dit=0) or coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) metrics indicating complexity. The low method count and absence of complex metrics suggest the class is already sufficiently decomposed for its current functionality."
