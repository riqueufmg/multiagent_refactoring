{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.DispatchingVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields and 0 methods, with a low LOC count of 60. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics (wmc=0) indicate minimal implementation complexity. While the class has dependencies on 5 external classes, this alone does not constitute insufficient modularization as the class itself appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex implementation that needs decomposition."
