    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Unloaded",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 51 lines of code (loc=51), and weighted method count of 0 (wmc=0). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed. While it has 5 dependencies, this is not excessive given its minimal functionality. The class appears to be a simple data holder or wrapper with minimal responsibilities, suggesting sufficient modularization."
