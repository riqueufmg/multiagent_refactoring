    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.PersistenceHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 fields (nof=10) and 222 lines of code (loc=222), but no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). Without method count and complexity metrics indicating high implementation complexity, and given the relatively moderate size and field count, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that further decomposition would be beneficial. The class appears to be a data holder or configuration class rather than a complex implementation that needs modularization."
