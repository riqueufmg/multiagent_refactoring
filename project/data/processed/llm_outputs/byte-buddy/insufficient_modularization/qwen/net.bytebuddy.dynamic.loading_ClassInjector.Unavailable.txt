    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code complexity (wmc=0), and only 28 lines of code (loc=28). It has minimal functionality with only 1 field (nof=1) and no parameters (nopf=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or marker class with no substantial implementation that would require further decomposition."
