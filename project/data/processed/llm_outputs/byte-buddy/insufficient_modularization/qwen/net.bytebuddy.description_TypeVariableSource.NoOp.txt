    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and minimal lines of code (loc=19). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating no computational complexity. LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple marker or placeholder class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
