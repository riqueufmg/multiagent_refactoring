    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 44 lines of code (loc=44), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. With 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0), the class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation. The low fan-in and fan-out (both 0) suggest limited dependencies, and the depth of inheritance tree is minimal (dit=1). Given its small size and low complexity, further decomposition would not provide significant benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
