{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.Dispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 27 fields (nof=27) and 758 lines of code (loc=758), indicating high size and complexity. With 6 public fields (nopf=6) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), the class lacks proper decomposition and encapsulation. The high number of fields suggests insufficient modularization as the class likely contains too much responsibility without being broken down into smaller, more manageable components."
