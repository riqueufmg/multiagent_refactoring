    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 32 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), no fields (nof=1), and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low size and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
