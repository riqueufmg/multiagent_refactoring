{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Resubmitter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields (nof=4), 0 methods (nom=0), and 98 lines of code (loc=98). The lack of methods (nopm=0, nom=0, wmc=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity. While the class is nested within AgentBuilder, its size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex, under-decomposed entity."
