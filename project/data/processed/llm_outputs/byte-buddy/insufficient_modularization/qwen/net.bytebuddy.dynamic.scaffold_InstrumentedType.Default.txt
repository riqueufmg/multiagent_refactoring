    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 fields (nof=24) and 856 lines of code (loc=856), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential incomplete decomposition where functionality may be embedded within complex field initialization or external dependencies. The high number of dependencies (18 external types) indicates tight coupling and potential for better modularization. The class appears to be a default implementation within a nested structure (InstrumentedType.Default) which often indicates a need for further decomposition to achieve better modularization."
