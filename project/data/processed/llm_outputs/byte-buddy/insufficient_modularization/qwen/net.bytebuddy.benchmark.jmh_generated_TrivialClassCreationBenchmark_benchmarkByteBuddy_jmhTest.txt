    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a manageable size with 275 lines of code and 9 methods. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) is 42, which is moderate. With only 263 fields, the class is not excessively large. The low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and single dependency suggest reasonable modularization. While the high number of fields (263) is notable, the overall complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization given the class appears to be a generated benchmark test class with a specific purpose."
