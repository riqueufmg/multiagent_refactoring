{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ImplementationDefinition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0), WMC=0, and only 49 lines of code. The lack of methods and low LOC indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. While it has one dependency on AnnotationDescription, the class itself appears to be a simple interface or minimal implementation that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
