    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription.SignatureToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 54 lines of code (loc=54). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is a simple data holder or value object rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its intended purpose."
