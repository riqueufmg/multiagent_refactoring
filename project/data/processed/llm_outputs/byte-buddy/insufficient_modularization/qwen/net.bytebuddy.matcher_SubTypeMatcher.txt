{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.SubTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 1 field (nof=1), and low lines of code (loc=26). The weighted method count (wmc=3) indicates simple method complexity. With only 2 public methods (nopm=2) and 3 total methods (nopf=0), the class follows reasonable encapsulation. The low LCOM value (0.0) suggests good cohesion among methods and attributes. The class size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a well-contained, focused component with appropriate decomposition."
