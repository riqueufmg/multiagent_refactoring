    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 72 lines of code but no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or interface implementation rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. No evidence of high complexity or size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
