    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 33 lines of code (loc=33), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies on other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
