    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription.Exports",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 23 lines of code (loc=23). The WMC (Weighted Method Count) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple data structure or value object with no significant functionality that would require further decomposition. LCOM is -1.0 which typically indicates good cohesion or a simple class structure. The low size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
