    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.ByteArrayUrlConnection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 31 lines of code (loc=31). It has minimal fields (nof=1) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
