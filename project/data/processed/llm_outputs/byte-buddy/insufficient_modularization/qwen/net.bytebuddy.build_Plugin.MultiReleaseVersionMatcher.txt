    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and minimal size (loc=39). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT=1 shows it doesn't inherit from other classes. With no methods or significant functionality, there is no meaningful decomposition possible to reduce size or complexity further."
