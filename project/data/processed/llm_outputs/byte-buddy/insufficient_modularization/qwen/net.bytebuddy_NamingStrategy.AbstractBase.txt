    "class": "net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 29 lines of code, 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and a depth of inheritance of 1 (dit=1). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity, and the small size (29 loc) does not suggest insufficient modularization. There are no indications that further decomposition would be beneficial."
