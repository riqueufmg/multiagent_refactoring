{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition.AnnotatedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple annotated type definition with no internal complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion, and the minimal metrics indicate this is already a well-modularized small component that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
