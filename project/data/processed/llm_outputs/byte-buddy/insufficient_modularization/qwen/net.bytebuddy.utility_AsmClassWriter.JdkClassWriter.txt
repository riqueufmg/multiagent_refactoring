{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.JdkClassWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 34 lines of code (loc=34). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class is nested (AsmClassWriter.JdkClassWriter), its extremely low complexity and size do not indicate insufficient modularization - it appears to be a simple, lightweight class with minimal responsibilities."
