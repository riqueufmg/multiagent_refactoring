    "justification": "The class has 11 fields and 225 lines of code which indicates moderate complexity, but without method count data (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) it's not possible to determine if further decomposition is needed. The class appears to be a specialized implementation for JNA Solaris door functionality with a reasonable scope."
