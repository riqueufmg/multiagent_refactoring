    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ClassLoadingDelegate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 fields (nof=9) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively low lines of code count (loc=292). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The class does not exhibit high complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
