    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.AccessResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 23 lines of code (loc=23). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. Since there are no methods or fields to decompose, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization despite being potentially underutilized or serving as a marker interface/enumeration."
