    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.GetOutputDirFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods or fields to decompose further, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately simple for its current functionality."
