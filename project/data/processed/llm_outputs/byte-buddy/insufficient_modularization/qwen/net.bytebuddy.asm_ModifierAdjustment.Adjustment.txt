    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ModifierAdjustment.Adjustment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, 37 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed. While it has dependencies on 3 external classes, this is not excessive given its minimal functionality. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration object that is appropriately modularized."
