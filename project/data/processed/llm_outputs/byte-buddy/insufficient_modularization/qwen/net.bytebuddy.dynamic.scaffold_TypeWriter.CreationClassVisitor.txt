    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.CreationClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a low lines of code count (loc=78). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal complexity. The lack of methods and low complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its current functionality."
