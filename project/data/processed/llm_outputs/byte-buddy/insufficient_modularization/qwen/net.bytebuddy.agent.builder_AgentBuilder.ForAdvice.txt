{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForAdvice",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 359 lines of code (loc) which is excessively high for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality. It has 14 fields (nof) but no methods (nom), suggesting it may be a data-heavy class that could benefit from decomposition. The class depends on 9 different external classes, indicating high complexity and multiple responsibilities that should be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
