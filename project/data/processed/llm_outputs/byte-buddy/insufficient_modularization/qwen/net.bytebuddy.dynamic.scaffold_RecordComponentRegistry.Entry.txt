    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 43 lines of code (loc=43). With minimal complexity (wmc=0, dit=1) and no signs of high coupling or lack of cohesion, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder with appropriate size and complexity."
