{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition.Sort",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), and 144 lines of code (loc=144). While the LOC is relatively high for a class with only 1 field and no methods, this appears to be an inner class (Sort) which typically serves as an enumeration or simple data holder. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
