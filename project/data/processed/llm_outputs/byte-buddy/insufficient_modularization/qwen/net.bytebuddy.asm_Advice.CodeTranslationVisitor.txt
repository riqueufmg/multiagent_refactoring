    "justification": "The class has 16 fields and 218 lines of code, but lacks sufficient metric data (WMC=0, NOM=0, NC=0, DIT=0) to conclusively determine insufficient modularization. Without complexity metrics and method count information, it's not possible to assess if further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
