    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithProxyWithTypePool_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a reasonable size with 276 lines of code and 263 fields, which is typical for a JMH-generated benchmark test class. The WMC of 42 indicates moderate complexity, and the class has only 9 methods with 8 private methods, suggesting appropriate encapsulation. The LCOM of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the lack of fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggests this class is not overly coupled. This appears to be a generated benchmark class with a specific purpose, so its current level of modularization is sufficient for its role."
