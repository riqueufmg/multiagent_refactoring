    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.MapEntryIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=35 but this appears to be the file loc not class loc), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The class also has 0 dependencies and 0 fan-in/fan-out metrics indicating minimal functionality. While the class exists, its extremely low complexity and minimal implementation suggest it is already sufficiently decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
