    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0). With minimal functionality and low lines of code (loc=51), the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed for its limited responsibilities."
