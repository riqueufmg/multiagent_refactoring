    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is already minimally decomposed. The low WMC (0) and NC (0) values support that this is a simple class with minimal complexity. While the LOC is 85, this is likely due to implementation details rather than insufficient modularization, as the class appears to be a minimal implementation with no internal complexity to decompose further."
