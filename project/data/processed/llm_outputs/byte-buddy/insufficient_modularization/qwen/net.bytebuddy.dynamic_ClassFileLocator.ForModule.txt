    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForModule",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 143 lines of code (loc=143). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal behavioral complexity. The lack of methods and low field count suggests the class is already sufficiently decomposed for its current functionality."
