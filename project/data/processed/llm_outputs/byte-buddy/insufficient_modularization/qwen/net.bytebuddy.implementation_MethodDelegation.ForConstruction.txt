{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.ForConstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 48 lines of code (loc=48), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple construction helper with limited responsibilities."
