{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Visitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 37 lines of code (loc=37). The WMC (Weighted Method Count) is 0, indicating no complex methods. The LCOM value is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple visitor interface or abstract class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
