{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 293 fields (nof), 44 methods (nom), and 9519 lines of code (loc). It also has a high number of dependencies (83) and a Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) of 44, indicating high complexity. These metrics suggest that the class is large and complex enough to benefit from further decomposition to improve modularity."
