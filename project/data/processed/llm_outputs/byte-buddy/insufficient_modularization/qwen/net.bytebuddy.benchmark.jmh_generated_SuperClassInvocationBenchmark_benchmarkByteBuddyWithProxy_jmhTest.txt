    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithProxy_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (276 LOC, 263 fields), low complexity (WMC=42), and minimal method count (9 total, 8 public). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the lack of fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggests simple usage patterns. While the field count is high, this appears to be a generated benchmark test class with acceptable complexity metrics that do not indicate insufficient modularization."
