    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.Prepared",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 fields (nof=12) and 198 lines of code (loc=198), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient decomposition. The class appears to be a nested class (MethodRegistry.Prepared) which should be further decomposed to reduce its implementation complexity and improve modularity."
