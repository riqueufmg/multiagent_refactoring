    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin.ValueMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 23 lines of code (loc=23), and WMC=0. The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple value matcher implementation with limited functionality that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
