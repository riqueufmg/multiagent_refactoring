    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is already minimally decomposed. With only 30 lines of code (loc=30) and no complexity (wmc=0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, focused implementation with no internal structure to further decompose."
