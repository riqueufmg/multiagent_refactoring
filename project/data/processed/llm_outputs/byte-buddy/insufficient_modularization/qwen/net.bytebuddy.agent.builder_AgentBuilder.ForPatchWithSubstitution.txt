{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForPatchWithSubstitution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 33 lines of code (loc=33), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
