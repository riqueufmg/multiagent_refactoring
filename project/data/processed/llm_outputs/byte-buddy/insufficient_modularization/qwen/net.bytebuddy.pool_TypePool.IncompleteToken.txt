    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 0 methods, with 189 lines of code. While the LOC is relatively high, the low number of fields and methods indicates minimal complexity. The class appears to be a simple data structure or token holder rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. No signs of high complexity or insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
