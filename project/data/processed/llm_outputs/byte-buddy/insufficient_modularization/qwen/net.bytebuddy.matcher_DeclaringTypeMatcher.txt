    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.DeclaringTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 3 weighted method count (wmc=3), and 27 lines of code (loc=27). The lack of fields (nof=1) and low method count indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused matcher implementation with minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
