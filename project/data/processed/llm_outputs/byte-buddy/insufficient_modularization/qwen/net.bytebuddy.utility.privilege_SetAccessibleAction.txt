    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 24 lines of code (loc=24), which indicates a small and focused implementation. The low WMC (2) suggests low complexity, and the class appears to have a single responsibility with no signs of needing further decomposition."
