    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription.Module",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 35 lines of code (loc=35). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating no computational complexity. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion. Based on the metrics, this class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already highly simplified and decomposed."
