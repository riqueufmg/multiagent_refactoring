    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 25 lines of code (loc=25). The WMC (Weighted Method Count) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple marker or placeholder class with no substantial functionality that would require further decomposition. Given its minimal size and complexity, it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
