    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.ForProductionTypes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 58 lines of code (loc=58). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests no cohesion issues. Given the minimal size and complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed."
