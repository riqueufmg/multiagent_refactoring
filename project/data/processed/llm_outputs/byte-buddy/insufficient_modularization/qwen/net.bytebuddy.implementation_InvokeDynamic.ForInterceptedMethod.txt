    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForInterceptedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 13 lines of code (loc=13) and zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0). The metrics indicate minimal size and implementation complexity, suggesting the class is already sufficiently decomposed. No further decomposition is needed to reduce its size or complexity."
