    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.IntegerConstant.TwoBytePush",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 23 lines of code (loc=23). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0). The low metric values indicate proper modularization rather than insufficient decomposition."
