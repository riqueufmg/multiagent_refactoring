    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is already minimally decomposed. With only 45 lines of code (loc=45) and no complexity (wmc=0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, well-decomposed empty list implementation."
