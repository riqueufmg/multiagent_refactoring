    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForArgumentSubstitution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 fields and 0 methods, with 109 lines of code. While the LOC is moderately high for the number of methods, the low method count and field count indicate it's already well-decomposed. The WMC of 0 suggests minimal complexity, and without other classes or packages to compare against, there's insufficient evidence this class needs further decomposition."
