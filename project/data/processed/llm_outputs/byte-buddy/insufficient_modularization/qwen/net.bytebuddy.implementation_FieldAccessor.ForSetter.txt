    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.ForSetter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 fields (nof=11) and 393 lines of code (loc=393), indicating high size and complexity. With 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 public methods (nopm=0), the class appears to be a data-only class or has very limited behavior, suggesting it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and improve modularity. The high field count relative to methods indicates insufficient modularization where functionality could be better distributed."
