    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 fields (nof=16) and 138 lines of code (loc=138), which indicates a moderate size. However, it has 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), suggesting it may be a data-only class or configuration class rather than a complex implementation that needs decomposition. The lack of methods and relatively contained size do not provide sufficient evidence of implementation complexity that would require further modularization."
