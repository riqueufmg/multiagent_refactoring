{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.MethodLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 50 lines of code (loc=50). With minimal complexity (wmc=0) and no methods, the class is already sufficiently decomposed. The low LOC and absence of methods indicate it does not contain excessive implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
