```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom=24) and 1502 lines of code (loc=1502), indicating high implementation complexity and size. The lack of public or protected fields (nopf=0, nof=26) and the high number of dependencies (21 external dependencies) suggest insufficient decomposition. The weighted method count (wmc=24) aligns with the method count, showing consistent complexity distribution, but the overall size and dependency count indicate the class could benefit from further modularization."
