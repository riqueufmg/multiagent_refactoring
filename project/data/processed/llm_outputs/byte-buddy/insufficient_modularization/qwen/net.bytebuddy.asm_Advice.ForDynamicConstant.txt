    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForDynamicConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 fields (nof=16) and 121 lines of code (loc=121), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. With 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), the class appears to be a data-only class or simple configuration class rather than a complex business logic class that would benefit from further decomposition. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest it is already sufficiently modularized for its intended purpose."
