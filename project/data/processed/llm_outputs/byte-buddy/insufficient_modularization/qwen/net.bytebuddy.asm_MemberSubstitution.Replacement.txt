    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 33 fields (nof=33) and 603 lines of code (loc=603), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The lack of methods (nom=0) despite high field count suggests poor decomposition where data and behavior are not properly organized into smaller, cohesive units."
