    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 32 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and WMC of 0. The low number of fields (1) and methods (0) indicates minimal functional complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex module requiring refactoring."
