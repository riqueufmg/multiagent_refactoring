{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForPatchWithGap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=35 but this appears to be the file location rather than actual code lines), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and complexity indicates insufficient data to determine if further decomposition would be beneficial, and the class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
