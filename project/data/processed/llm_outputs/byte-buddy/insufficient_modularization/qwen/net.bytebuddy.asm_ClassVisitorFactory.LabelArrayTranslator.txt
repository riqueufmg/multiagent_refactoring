{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.LabelArrayTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a very low LOC count of 65. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal complexity. While the class has some dependencies (3 fanout), the low number of fields and methods suggests it is already sufficiently decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0) indicates this may be a data-only class or interface, which doesn't require further decomposition."
