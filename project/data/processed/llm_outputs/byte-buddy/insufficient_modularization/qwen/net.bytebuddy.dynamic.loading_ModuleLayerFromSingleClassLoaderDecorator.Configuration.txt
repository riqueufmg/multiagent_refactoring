    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.Configuration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While the class depends on JavaDispatcher, the extremely low internal complexity and size do not indicate insufficient modularization - there is no evidence of incomplete decomposition or excessive size/complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
