{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaInstanceFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 27 fields (nof=27) and 502 lines of code (loc=502), indicating high size and potential complexity. With no methods (nom=0) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be a data-only class that may encapsulate too much functionality without proper decomposition. The high number of dependencies (18 external classes) suggests it has complex responsibilities that could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
