    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 360 lines of code (loc), 9 fields (nof), and depends on 6 external classes. The high line count and number of fields suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity. The class appears to be a nested class that may be handling too much responsibility within the type description hierarchy."
