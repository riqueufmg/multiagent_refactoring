    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForSelfOrStaticInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0), and 81 lines of code (loc=81). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex implementation that requires modularization."
