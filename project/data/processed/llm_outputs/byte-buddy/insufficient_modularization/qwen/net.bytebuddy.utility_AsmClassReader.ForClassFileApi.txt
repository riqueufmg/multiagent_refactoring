    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader.ForClassFileApi",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 130 lines of code. It has a low depth of inheritance (dit=1) and no direct dependencies on other classes. The lack of methods and low LOC indicate this is already a highly decomposed and simple class that does not require further modularization."
