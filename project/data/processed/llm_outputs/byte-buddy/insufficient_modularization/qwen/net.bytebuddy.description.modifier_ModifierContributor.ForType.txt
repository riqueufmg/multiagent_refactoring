    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 9 lines of code (loc), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and no dependencies. The class appears to be a simple, well-encapsulated component that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
