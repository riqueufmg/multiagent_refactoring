{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.Resolution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 0 lines of code (loc=82 but this appears to be file-level not class-level), and WMC=0. The metrics indicate minimal implementation complexity and size, suggesting the class is already sufficiently decomposed. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be a simple data holder or resolution result class with minimal responsibilities."
