    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList.Empty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is already minimally decomposed. With only 30 lines of code (loc=30) and weighted method count of 0 (wmc=0), the class exhibits minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The lack of any methods or fields suggests this is a simple, well-factored empty implementation pattern rather than an under-decomposed complex class."
