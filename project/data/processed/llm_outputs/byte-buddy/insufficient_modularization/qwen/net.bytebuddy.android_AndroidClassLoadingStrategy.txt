{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 29 fields (nof=29) and 654 lines of code (loc=654), indicating high size and complexity. It also has 7 dependencies on nested classes and other classes, suggesting it contains multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into separate modules. The high number of fields and lines of code suggest insufficient modularization as the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
