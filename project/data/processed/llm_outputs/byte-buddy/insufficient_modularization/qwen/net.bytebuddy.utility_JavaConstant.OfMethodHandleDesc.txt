    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.OfMethodHandleDesc",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 20 lines of code (loc=20). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While it has a dependency on JavaDispatcher, the class itself appears to be a simple, lightweight component that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization based on its isolated metrics."
