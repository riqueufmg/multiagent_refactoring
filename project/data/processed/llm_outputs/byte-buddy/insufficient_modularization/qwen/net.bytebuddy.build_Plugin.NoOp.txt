{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is already minimally decomposed. With only 28 lines of code (loc=28) and no complexity (wmc=0), the class is too small to benefit from further decomposition. The lack of methods and fields suggests this is likely a marker or placeholder class that doesn't require additional modularization."
