    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 public fields, 0 methods, 0 public methods, and WMC of 0. The LOC is 38 which is relatively small. LCOM is -1.0 which may indicate insufficient data rather than poor cohesion. The class appears to be a simple data structure or minimal implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
