    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 68 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies to other classes beyond the single dependency to ByteBuddyAndroidService. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple structure and limited responsibilities."
