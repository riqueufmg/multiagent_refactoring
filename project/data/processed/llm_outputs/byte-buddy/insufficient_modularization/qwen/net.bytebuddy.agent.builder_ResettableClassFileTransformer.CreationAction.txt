    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely an empty or placeholder class. With only 18 lines of code (loc=18) and no complexity (wmc=0), the class is already minimal and does not exhibit insufficient modularization since there is no substantial code to decompose further."
