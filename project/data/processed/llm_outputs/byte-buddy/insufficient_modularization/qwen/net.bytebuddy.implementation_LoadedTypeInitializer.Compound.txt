    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 54 lines of code (loc=54). The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), suggesting minimal complexity. With only 2 fields and no methods, further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
