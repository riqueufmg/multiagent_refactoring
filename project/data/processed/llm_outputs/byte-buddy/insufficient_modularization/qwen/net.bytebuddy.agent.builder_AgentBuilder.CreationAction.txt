    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 18 lines of code (loc=18) and zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0). The low size and minimal implementation complexity indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation that does not warrant additional modularization."
