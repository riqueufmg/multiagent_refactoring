{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForDefaultValues",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 74 lines of code (loc=74). While the class has some dependencies on other classes, the low number of fields and methods indicates it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) suggests this is likely a data-only class or simple configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
