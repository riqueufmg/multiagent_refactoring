    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 5 public methods (nopm=5), 186 lines of code (loc=186), and weighted method count of 10 (wmc=10). While the class has moderate complexity, it does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains reasonable size and method count. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.333) suggests reasonable internal cohesion. The class appears to be a utility type with appropriate responsibilities for handling Java type representations."
