    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 36 lines of code (loc=36). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No other complexity metrics (nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0) suggest insufficient modularization issues."
