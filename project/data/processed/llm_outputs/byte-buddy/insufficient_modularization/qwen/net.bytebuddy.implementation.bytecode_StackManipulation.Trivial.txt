    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 19 lines of code (loc=19). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT is 1 showing no deep inheritance. The class appears to be a simple, minimal implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already appropriately decomposed for its current functionality."
