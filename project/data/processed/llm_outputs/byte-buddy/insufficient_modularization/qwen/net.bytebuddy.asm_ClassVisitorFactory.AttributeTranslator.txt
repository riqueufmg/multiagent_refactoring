    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.AttributeTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 65 lines of code (loc=65). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on 4 other classes and 65 lines of code, the low method count and field count suggest it is already reasonably decomposed. The WMC of 0 indicates no method complexity, and the DIT of 1 shows it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy. The class appears to be a simple data holder or translator with minimal behavior that doesn't warrant further decomposition."
