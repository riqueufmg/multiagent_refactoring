    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.ForSdkCompiler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 fields (nof=14) and 252 lines of code (loc=252), indicating high size and potential complexity. With 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 public methods (nopm=0), the class appears to be a data-only class or has methods that are not properly counted, suggesting insufficient decomposition of functionality. The high number of fields relative to methods indicates that this class likely contains too much responsibility and could benefit from further modularization by extracting related fields and their associated logic into separate, more cohesive classes."
