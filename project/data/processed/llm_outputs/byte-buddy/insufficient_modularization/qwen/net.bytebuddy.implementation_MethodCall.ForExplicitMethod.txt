    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForExplicitMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=28 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and weighted method count of 0 (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low complexity indicates insufficient data to determine insufficient modularization, and the class appears to be a simple, well-contained component."
