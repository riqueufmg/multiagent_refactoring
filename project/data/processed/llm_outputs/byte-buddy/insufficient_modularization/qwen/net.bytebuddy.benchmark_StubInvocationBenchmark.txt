{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.StubInvocationBenchmark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (203 loc, 6 methods) and low complexity (WMC=6). While it has 14 fields which is relatively high, the lack of inheritance (DIT=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it's appropriately modularized for its purpose. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class."
