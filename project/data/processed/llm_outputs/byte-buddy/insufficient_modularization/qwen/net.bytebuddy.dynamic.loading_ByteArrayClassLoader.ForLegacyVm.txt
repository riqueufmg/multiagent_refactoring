    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 13 lines of code and 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0). There are no fields (nof=0) or dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, lightweight implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
