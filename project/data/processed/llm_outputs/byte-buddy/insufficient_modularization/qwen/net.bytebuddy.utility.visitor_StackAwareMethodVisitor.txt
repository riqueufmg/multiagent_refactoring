    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor.StackAwareMethodVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 24 methods (nom), 19 public methods (nopm), 318 lines of code (loc), and a weighted method count of 84 (wmc). These metrics suggest the class is large and complex enough that further decomposition could reduce its size and implementation complexity, indicating insufficient modularization."
