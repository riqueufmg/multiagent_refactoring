    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 22 lines of code (loc). It has minimal dependencies (3 fanout) and no inheritance (dit=0). The low metric values indicate proper modularization rather than insufficient decomposition."
