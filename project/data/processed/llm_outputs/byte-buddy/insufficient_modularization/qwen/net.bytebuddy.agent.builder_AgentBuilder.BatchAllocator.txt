    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 fields (nof=14) and 370 lines of code (loc=370), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential issues with decomposition. With 3 dependencies and significant size, the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
