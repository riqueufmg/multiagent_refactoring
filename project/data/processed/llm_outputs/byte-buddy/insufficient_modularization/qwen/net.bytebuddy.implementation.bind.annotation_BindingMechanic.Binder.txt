    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 39 lines of code (loc=39), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
