{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ResolvedDelegate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 38 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0). The low number of fields (1) and methods (0) indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or delegate with minimal responsibilities, making it sufficiently modularized for its current scope."
