    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 20 lines of code (loc=20), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With 0 fields (nof=0) and a depth of inheritance tree of 1 (dit=1), this class appears to be already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
