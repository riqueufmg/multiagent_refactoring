    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription.ForLoadedRecordComponent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 123 lines of code (loc=123). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of fields, the class appears to be a specialized adapter/wrapper for loaded record components with minimal complexity (wmc=0, nc=0). The low method count and lack of complex dependencies suggest it is appropriately focused on a single responsibility rather than being insufficiently modularized."
