    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.TrivialClassCreationBenchmark_jmhType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 2 lines of code (loc=2). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0) and Lack of Cohesion metric is -1.0 (lcom=-1.0), indicating very low complexity. With such minimal functionality and implementation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already at a minimal decomposition state."
