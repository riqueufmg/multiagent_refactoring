    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (307 LOC) and complexity (WMC=8, NOM=8) with a reasonable number of fields (NOF=2). The negative LCOM value (-1.0) suggests good cohesion among methods and fields. The class directly extends FilterableList and has manageable dependencies, indicating appropriate modularization for its functionality."
