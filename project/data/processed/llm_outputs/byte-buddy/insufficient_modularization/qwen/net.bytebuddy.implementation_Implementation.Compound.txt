    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low weight method count (wmc=0). The lines of code (loc=138) are reasonable for a compound implementation class. The class has no direct dependencies on other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shows no signs of excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
