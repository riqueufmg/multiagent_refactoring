    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Sink",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 88 lines of code. It has minimal dependencies with only 1 field and no method parameters. The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
