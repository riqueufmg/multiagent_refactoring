    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 4 fields (nof=4), with 90 lines of code (loc=90). The weighted method count (wmc=7) indicates low complexity. The low coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) and reasonable LCOM value (0.4) suggest good cohesion. The size and complexity are within acceptable limits for a single class, and there is no clear indication that further decomposition would provide significant benefits."
