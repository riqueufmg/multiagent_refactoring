{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4), 0 methods (nom=0), and 149 lines of code (loc=149). While the LOC is moderately high for a class with few methods, the low method count and lack of complex metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) suggest this is likely a simple data class or configuration class rather than a complex class needing decomposition. The dependencies are minimal (2 external classes) and do not indicate excessive coupling that would necessitate further modularization."
