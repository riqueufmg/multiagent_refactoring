    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.MethodParameterTypesMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 26 lines of code (loc=26), which indicates a small and focused implementation. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no package dependencies (fanout=0), the class appears to be well-focused on a single responsibility. The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion among the methods and field. The class size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
