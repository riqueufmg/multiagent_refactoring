    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.ClassWriterStrategy.Delegating",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 41 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and no inheritance depth (dit=0). While it has dependencies on 4 external classes, the low internal complexity and size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple delegating implementation that does not require further decomposition."
