    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.MethodSizeHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 333 lines of code (loc) which is excessively high for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller classes. The class has 11 fields (nof) but no methods (nom=0), suggesting it may be an incomplete or poorly structured class that hasn't been properly decomposed. The lack of methods despite having multiple fields indicates insufficient modularization where related functionality has not been properly separated into distinct methods or classes."
