{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForInnerClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 44 lines of code (loc=44). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple inner class with basic functionality."
