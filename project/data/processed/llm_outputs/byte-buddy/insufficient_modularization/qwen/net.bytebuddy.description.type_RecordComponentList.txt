{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3) and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lines of code (loc=232) include comments and whitespace, and the actual implementation complexity is low. The class has only 2 nested classes (nc=2) which is reasonable for a list implementation. The lack of public fields (nopf=0) and methods (nopm=0) indicates proper encapsulation. The class appears to be a well-contained, focused implementation of a list for record components without excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
