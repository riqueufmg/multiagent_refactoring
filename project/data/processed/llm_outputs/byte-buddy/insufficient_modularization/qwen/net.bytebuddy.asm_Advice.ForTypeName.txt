    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 1 public field, 0 methods, 0 public methods, and only 17 lines of code. The WMC is 0, NC is 0, and DIT is 0 indicating minimal complexity. With such low metrics across all complexity indicators, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already highly simplified and decomposed."
