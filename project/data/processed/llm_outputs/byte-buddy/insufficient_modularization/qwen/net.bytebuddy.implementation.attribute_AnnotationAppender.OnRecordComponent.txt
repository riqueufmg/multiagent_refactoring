    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), 0 lines of code (loc), and 0 weighted method count (wmc). With no methods or significant functionality, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already minimally implemented."
