{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ExecutingTransformer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 32 fields (nof=32) and 484 lines of code (loc=484), indicating high size and complexity. With no methods (nom=0) but 32 fields, this suggests the class likely contains substantial implementation logic within its fields or constructors that could be decomposed into separate classes or modules. The high number of dependencies (11 external dependencies) further indicates this class has too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition to reduce complexity and improve modularity."
