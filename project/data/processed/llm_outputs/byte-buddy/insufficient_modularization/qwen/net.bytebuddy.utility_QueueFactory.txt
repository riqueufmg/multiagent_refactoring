    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 65 lines of code (loc=65), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=4) indicates low complexity. While the class has some dependencies, the size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its current functionality."
