{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.ClassByExtensionBenchmark",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 23 methods (nom) with 20 public methods (nopm), 309 lines of code (loc), and WMC of 25. The class implements multiple benchmark scenarios with 13 fields (nof) and 1 private field (nopf), suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. LCOM value of 0.1739130434782608 indicates low cohesion, and the numerous dependencies (9 external classes) suggest the class is trying to handle too many responsibilities in a single unit."
