{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ModifierAdjustment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 23 methods (nom) and 22 public methods (nopm), along with a WMC of 25 indicating high internal complexity. The class also has 349 lines of code (loc) which is substantial. It depends on 14 different classes, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The combination of high method count, high complexity metrics, and multiple dependencies indicates that this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
