{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 methods (nom=28) with a total of 47 weighted method complexity (wmc=47), indicating high implementation complexity. It also contains 35 fields (nof=35) and 1185 lines of code (loc=1185), suggesting large size. The class has 21 public methods (nopm=21) and 2 public fields (nopf=2), showing a high public interface. Additionally, it has numerous internal dependencies (21 listed), indicating tight coupling and lack of proper decomposition. These metrics collectively suggest that the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce both size and complexity."
