    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 157 lines of code which is not excessively large, and there are no public methods (nopm=0, nom=0) or fields (nof=0, nopf=0) indicating minimal complexity. The lack of methods and fields suggests this may be a simple data holder or nested class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. No clear indicators of high complexity or need for modularization are present."
