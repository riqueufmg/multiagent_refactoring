    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AnnotationRemoval.AnnotationRemovingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 44 lines of code (loc=44), and no methods (nom=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No other complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) suggest the need for additional modularization."
