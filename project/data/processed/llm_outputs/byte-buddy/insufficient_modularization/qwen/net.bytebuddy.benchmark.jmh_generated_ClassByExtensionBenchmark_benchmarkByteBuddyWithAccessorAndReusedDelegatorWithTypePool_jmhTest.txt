    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithAccessorAndReusedDelegatorWithTypePool_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (9 total, 8 public), low cyclomatic complexity (WMC=42), and reasonable size (276 LOC). While the class has many fields (263), this appears to be characteristic of JMH-generated benchmark test classes which typically contain numerous generated fields for benchmark execution. The low LCOM value (0.0) suggests good cohesion, and the absence of fan-in/fan-out dependencies indicates this is likely a self-contained generated test class rather than a complex business logic class requiring decomposition."
