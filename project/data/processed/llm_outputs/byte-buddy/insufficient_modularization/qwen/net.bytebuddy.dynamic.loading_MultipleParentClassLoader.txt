{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.MultipleParentClassLoader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with 14 weighted method complexity (wmc=14), indicating moderate complexity. The lines of code (loc=325) are within reasonable limits for a class with this level of functionality. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest proper modularization. The class appears to be well-contained with appropriate responsibilities for a class loader implementation."
