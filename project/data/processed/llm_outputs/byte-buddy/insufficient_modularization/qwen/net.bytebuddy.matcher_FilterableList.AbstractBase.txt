    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 44 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and a WMC of 0. The DIT of 1 indicates it's at the root of the hierarchy, and with no methods present, there's no implementation complexity to decompose further. The class appears to be a minimal abstract base class with no signs of insufficient modularization."
