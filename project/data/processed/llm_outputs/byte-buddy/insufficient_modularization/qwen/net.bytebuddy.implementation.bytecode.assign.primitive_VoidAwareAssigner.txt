    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.VoidAwareAssigner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 5 weighted method count (wmc=5), 33 lines of code (loc=33), and no class-level dependencies (nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of methods and low complexity metrics indicate sufficient modularization without need for further decomposition."
