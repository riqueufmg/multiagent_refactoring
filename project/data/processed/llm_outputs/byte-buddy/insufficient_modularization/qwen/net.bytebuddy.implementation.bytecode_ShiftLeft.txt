{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ShiftLeft",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 40 lines of code (loc=40), and low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused implementation with appropriate size and complexity."
