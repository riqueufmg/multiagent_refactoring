    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.PatchingModuleVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields and 0 methods, with a relatively small size of 144 lines of code. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate that the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit complexity that would warrant further modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or visitor pattern implementation with minimal responsibilities."
