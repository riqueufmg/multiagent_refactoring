    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer.ForStaticField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields, 0 methods, and 79 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no public or private methods to suggest implementation complexity. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate this class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
