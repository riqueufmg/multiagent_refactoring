{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high lines of code (371 LOC) and high weighted method complexity (WMC = 9), indicating significant implementation complexity. It also has a high lack of cohesion in methods (LCOM = 0.75), suggesting poor internal structure. The class contains 12 fields and 4 methods, with complex dependencies on multiple nested classes and external types, which indicates it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
