    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Division",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class is not data-heavy. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and single inheritance level (dit=1) indicate simplicity. While LCOM is 0.667 suggesting some cohesion issues, the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
