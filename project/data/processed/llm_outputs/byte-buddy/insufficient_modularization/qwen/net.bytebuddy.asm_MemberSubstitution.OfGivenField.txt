    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfGivenField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 22 lines of code (loc=22). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex entity requiring modularization."
