    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.GetterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a low lines of code count (loc=42). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and simple field structure indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or factory configuration class with straightforward responsibilities."
