    "class": "org.gradle.api.file.DirectoryProperty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4) and 26 lines of code (loc=26), which indicates a small and manageable size. With 0 fields (nof=0) and no class dependencies (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to be well-focused with minimal complexity. The negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) suggests good method cohesion. These metrics indicate sufficient modularization for this class."
