{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Suppressing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 107 lines of code (loc=107). While the class has a relatively high number of dependencies (4 external dependencies), the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already well-decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) indicate this is likely a data-only class or simple container that does not require further decomposition."
