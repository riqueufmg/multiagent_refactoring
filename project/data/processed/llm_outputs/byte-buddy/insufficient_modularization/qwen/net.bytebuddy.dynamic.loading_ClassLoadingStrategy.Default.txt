    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 fields (nof=14) and 247 lines of code (loc=247), indicating high size and complexity for a single class. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential incomplete decomposition where functionality may be embedded in complex field initializations or nested classes. High field count and substantial LOC without corresponding methods indicate insufficient modularization where the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
