    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with 7 private methods (nopm=7), indicating high internal complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=17) suggests significant implementation complexity. With 153 lines of code (loc=153) and only 3 fields (nof=3), the class appears to have substantial responsibilities that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high ratio of private methods to total methods (7/8) and the substantial WMC value indicate that further modularization could reduce both size and implementation complexity."
