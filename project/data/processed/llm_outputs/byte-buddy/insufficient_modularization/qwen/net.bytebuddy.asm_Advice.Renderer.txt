{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Renderer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 6 public fields (nopf=6), with no methods (nom=0, nopm=0). The lines of code (loc=160) and weighted method count (wmc=0) are relatively low. The lack of methods and low complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition is not warranted, as the class is already sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
