    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 29 fields (nof=29) and 502 lines of code (loc=502), indicating high size and potential complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests possible insufficient decomposition where functionality might be embedded within field initializations or nested structures rather than being properly modularized. High number of dependencies (15 external dependencies) indicates tight coupling with other components, which combined with its size suggests insufficient modularization."
