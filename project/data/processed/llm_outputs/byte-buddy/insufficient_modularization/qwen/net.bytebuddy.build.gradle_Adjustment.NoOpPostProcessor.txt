```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Adjustment.NoOpPostProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 12 lines of code (loc=12). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). This indicates a minimal, well-decomposed class that serves a single purpose as a no-op implementation. The lack of complexity and minimal size suggests sufficient modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
