{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForSelfCallHandle",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and minimal structural complexity (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization. While it has 78 lines of code (loc=78), this is distributed across a minimal structure, and the class appears to be a simple, focused component with clear responsibilities."
