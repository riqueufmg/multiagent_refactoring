    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.ForImplicitProperty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), and 193 lines of code (loc=193). While the LOC is relatively high for a class with no methods, the lack of methods suggests this may be a data-only class or inner class with minimal behavior. The WMC of 0 indicates no method complexity, and the DIT of 2 shows minimal inheritance depth. Without additional methods or behavioral complexity, there's insufficient evidence of incomplete decomposition or complexity that would benefit from further modularization."
