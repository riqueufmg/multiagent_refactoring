    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 22 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 dependencies. The metrics indicate minimal size and implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. WMC is 0, NOM is 0, and there are no dependencies or complex relationships that would benefit from modularization."
