    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.Initializable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 15 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low WMC (0) and absence of structural complexity indicators suggest it is already sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
