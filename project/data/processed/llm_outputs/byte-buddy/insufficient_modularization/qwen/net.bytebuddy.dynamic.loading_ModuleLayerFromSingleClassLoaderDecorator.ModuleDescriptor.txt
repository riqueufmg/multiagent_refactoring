    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.ModuleDescriptor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 24 lines of code (loc=24). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no internal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). This indicates a minimal, focused class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or decorator with minimal functionality that would not benefit from further decomposition."
