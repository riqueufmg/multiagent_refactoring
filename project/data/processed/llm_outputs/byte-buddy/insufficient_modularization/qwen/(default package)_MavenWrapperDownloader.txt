    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (93 loc) and complexity (WMC=12) for its functionality. With 6 methods and 6 fields, the class maintains a cohesive structure. The LCOM value of 0.833 suggests good cohesion within the class. The absence of dependencies and fan-in/fan-out indicates it's a self-contained utility class, which is appropriately modularized for its purpose as a Maven wrapper downloader."
