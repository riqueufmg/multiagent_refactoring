    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription.InGenericShape",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 9 lines of code (loc=9). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0) and Lack of Cohesion metric is -1.0 (lcom=-1.0). These metrics indicate minimal complexity and size, suggesting the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
