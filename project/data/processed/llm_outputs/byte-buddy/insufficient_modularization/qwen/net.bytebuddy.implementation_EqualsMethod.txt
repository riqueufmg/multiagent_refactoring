{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15) with 13 private methods (nopm=13), indicating high implementation complexity. The lines of code (loc=843) are substantial for a single class, and the Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=16) suggests significant behavioral complexity. The class also has a high number of dependencies (20) which indicates it is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high LCOM value (0.533) further suggests that the class lacks cohesion and contains multiple responsibilities that should be separated."
