    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.BuildLogger.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 155 lines of code (loc=155). The lack of methods and low method complexity indicate that further decomposition would not significantly reduce size or implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation that does not warrant further modularization."
