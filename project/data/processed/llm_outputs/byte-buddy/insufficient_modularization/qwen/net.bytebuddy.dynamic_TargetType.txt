    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TargetType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 1 field (nof=1), with low complexity (wmc=3, loc=30). The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused component with minimal responsibilities."
