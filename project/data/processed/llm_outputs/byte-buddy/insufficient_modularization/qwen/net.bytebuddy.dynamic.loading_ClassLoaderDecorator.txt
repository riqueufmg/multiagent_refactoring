    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoaderDecorator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 1 field (nof=1), with a low weighted method count (wmc=2). The lines of code (loc=70) are relatively small and the class has a simple structure with no inheritance (dit=0). These metrics indicate the class is already well-modularized and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
