    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 fields and 0 methods, with a relatively low LOC of 312. While the class contains some fields, the metric values do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The low number of methods (0) and fields (9) suggests reasonable modularization for this data holder class."
