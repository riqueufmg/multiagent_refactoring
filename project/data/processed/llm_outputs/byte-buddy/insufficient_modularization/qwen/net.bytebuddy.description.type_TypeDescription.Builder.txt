{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 583 lines of code (loc) which is excessively high for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The class has 9 fields (nof) but no methods (nom=0), suggesting it may be a data-heavy class that lacks proper behavioral decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) combined with high line count suggests insufficient modularization where logic may be embedded in complex field initializations or the class serves as a monolithic data structure without proper behavioral separation."
