    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 35 lines of code (loc=35). It also has minimal dependencies with only 2 fields (nof=2) and no fan-in or fan-out dependencies. The low complexity metrics indicate insufficient complexity to warrant further modularization."
