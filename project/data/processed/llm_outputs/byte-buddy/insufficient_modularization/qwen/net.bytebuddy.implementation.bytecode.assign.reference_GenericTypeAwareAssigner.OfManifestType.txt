    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 49 lines of code (loc=49), and 0 weighted method complexity (wmc=0). The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further modularization."
