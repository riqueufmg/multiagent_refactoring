    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (42 LOC) and complexity (WMC=7, NOM=7) for its functionality. With only 1 field and 7 methods, it maintains good cohesion (LCOM=0.429) and does not exhibit excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current responsibilities."
