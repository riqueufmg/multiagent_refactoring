    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.BootstrapArgumentResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields and 109 lines of code. It has no methods (nom=0) and therefore low implementation complexity. The dependencies are minimal and focused on core functionality related to method description and type handling. There is no evidence of incomplete decomposition or excessive size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
