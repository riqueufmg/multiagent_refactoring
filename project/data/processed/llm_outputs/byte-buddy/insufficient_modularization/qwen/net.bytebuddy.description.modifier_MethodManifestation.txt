    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with 7 being public (nopm=7), which indicates a focused and well-defined interface. The lines of code (loc=82) and weighted method count (wmc=8) are reasonable for a class with this method count. The lack of fan-in (fanin=0) and fan-out (fanout=0) dependencies suggests it's a relatively self-contained utility class. The low LCOM value (0.375) indicates good cohesion among the methods. The single field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0) suggest proper encapsulation. Overall, the metrics indicate appropriate modularization for this class's purpose."
