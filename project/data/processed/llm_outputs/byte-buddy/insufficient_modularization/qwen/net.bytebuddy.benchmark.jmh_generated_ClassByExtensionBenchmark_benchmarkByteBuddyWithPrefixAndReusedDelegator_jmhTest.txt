    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a reasonable size with 276 lines of code and 9 methods. The WMC of 42 indicates moderate complexity. With only 1 public method (benchmarkByteBuddyWithPrefixAndReusedDelegator) and 8 private methods that appear to be JMH-generated helper methods, this class follows a focused responsibility pattern typical for JMH benchmark test classes. The LCOM of 0.0 suggests good cohesion among the methods."
