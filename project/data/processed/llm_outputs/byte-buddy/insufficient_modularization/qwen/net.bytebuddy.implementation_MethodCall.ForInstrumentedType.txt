    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForInstrumentedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0), and only 51 lines of code (loc=51). With minimal functionality and low complexity, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class does not exhibit the characteristics of being overly large or complex that would require further decomposition."
