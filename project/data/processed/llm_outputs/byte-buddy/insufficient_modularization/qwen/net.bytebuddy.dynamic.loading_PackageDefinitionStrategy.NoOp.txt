```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). This indicates a minimal, well-decomposed class that serves a single focused purpose as a NoOp implementation. The low size and complexity metrics suggest sufficient modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
