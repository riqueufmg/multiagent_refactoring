    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and only 18 lines of code (loc=18). It also has minimal dependencies with only 1 fan-in and 0 fan-out connections. The low number of methods and small size indicate sufficient modularization for this class's current functionality."
