{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.CreationAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 23 lines of code (loc=23). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal utility class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
