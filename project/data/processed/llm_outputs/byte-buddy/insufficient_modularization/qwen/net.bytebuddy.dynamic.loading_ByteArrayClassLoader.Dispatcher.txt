    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 24 lines of code (loc=24). The absence of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple dispatcher or marker interface with no substantial functionality to decompose."
