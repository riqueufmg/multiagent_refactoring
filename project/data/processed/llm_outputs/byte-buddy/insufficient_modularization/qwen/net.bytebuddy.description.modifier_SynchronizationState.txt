    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.SynchronizationState",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low implementation complexity. The lack of fields (nof=1) and the simple dependency structure with only one dependency suggest this class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
