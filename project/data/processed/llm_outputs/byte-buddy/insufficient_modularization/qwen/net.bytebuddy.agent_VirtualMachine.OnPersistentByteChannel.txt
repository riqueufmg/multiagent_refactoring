    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.OnPersistentByteChannel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 94 lines of code. The lack of methods and low field count indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
