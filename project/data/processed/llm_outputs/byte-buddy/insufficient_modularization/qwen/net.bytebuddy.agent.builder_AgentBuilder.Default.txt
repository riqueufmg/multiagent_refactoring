    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 88 fields (nof=88) and 2133 lines of code (loc=2133), indicating high size and potential complexity. It also has a large number of dependencies (23 external types used), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to improve modularity and reduce implementation complexity."
