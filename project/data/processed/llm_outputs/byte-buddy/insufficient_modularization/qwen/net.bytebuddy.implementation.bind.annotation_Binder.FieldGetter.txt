    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.FieldGetter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with 64 lines of code. The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. The WMC of 0 suggests minimal complexity, and the DIT of 1 indicates it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
