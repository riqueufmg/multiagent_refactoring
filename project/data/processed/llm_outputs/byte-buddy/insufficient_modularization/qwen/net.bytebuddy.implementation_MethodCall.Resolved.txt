    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.Resolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4), 0 methods (nom=0), and 50 lines of code (loc=50). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and very limited size indicate this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The metrics do not suggest complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
