    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin.InvokeSuper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely an empty or minimal class. With only 86 lines of code (loc=86) and no complexity metrics indicating high complexity (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0), there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be properly decomposed or is a simple data holder."
