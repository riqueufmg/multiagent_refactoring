    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a manageable size with 276 lines of code and 9 methods. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) is 42, which is moderate. With 263 fields, the class is data-heavy but this is typical for JMH-generated benchmark test classes that store various state and configuration data. The low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and single dependency suggest good isolation. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class. Given that this is a generated benchmark test class, its structure is appropriate for its purpose and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
