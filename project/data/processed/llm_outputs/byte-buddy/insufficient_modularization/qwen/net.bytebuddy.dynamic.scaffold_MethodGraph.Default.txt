    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 32 fields (nof=32) and 1079 lines of code (loc=1079), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The lack of methods (nom=0) despite high field count suggests poor decomposition, as the class likely contains data and logic that should be separated into smaller, more focused components."
