    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (94 loc), low complexity (WMC=5), good cohesion (LCOM=1.0), and appropriate number of methods (4) and fields (3). The depth of inheritance (DIT=2) is acceptable. While the class has some dependencies, it appears to be well-focused on its responsibility as a ToStringPlugin with proper encapsulation."
