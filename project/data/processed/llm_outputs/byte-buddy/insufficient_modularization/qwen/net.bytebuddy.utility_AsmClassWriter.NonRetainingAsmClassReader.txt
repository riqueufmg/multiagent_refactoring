    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.NonRetainingAsmClassReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal size with only 58 lines of code (loc=58), and no inheritance hierarchy to analyze (dit=1). With no methods present, there is no implementation complexity to decompose, and the class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal utility class rather than a candidate for further modularization."
