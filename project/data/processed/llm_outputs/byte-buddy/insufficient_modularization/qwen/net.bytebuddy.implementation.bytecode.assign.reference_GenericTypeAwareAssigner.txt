    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 360 lines of code (loc) and only 1 method (nom), indicating high implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. The high loc count relative to the single method suggests the method likely contains complex logic that should be broken down into smaller, more manageable methods. While WMC is low (4), the concentration of logic in a single method within a large class body indicates insufficient modularization."
