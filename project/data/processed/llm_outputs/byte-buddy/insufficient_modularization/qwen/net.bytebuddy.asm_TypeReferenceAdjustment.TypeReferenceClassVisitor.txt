    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeReferenceAdjustment.TypeReferenceClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 8 fields but no methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0), indicating it may be a data-only class rather than a complex class needing decomposition. The LOC is 408 which is moderate, and without method complexity metrics or high coupling indicators, there's insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a visitor pattern implementation with minimal behavioral complexity."
