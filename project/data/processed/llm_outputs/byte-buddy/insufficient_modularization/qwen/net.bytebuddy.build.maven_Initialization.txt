    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.Initialization",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 47 lines of code (loc=47), and weighted method count of 5 (wmc=5). The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=1, lcom=0.0) indicates it is already well modularized. The small size and low complexity metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization."
