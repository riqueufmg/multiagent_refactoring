{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithExceptionHandling",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 99 lines of code (loc=99). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on 3 other classes and 99 lines of code, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
