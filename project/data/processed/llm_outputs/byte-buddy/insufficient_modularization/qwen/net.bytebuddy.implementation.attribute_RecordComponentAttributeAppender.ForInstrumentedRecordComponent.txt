    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.RecordComponentAttributeAppender.ForInstrumentedRecordComponent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 23 lines of code (loc=23). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple, focused component that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already appropriately decomposed for its current functionality."
