    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.FieldModifierTransformer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 0 methods, 22 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex business logic class that would benefit from modularization."
