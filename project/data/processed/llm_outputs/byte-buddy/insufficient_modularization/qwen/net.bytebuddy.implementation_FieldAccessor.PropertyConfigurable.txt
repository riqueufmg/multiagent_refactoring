{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.PropertyConfigurable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 91 lines of code which is relatively small, has no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), no complexity (wmc=0), and no inheritance depth beyond itself (dit=1). While the LOC count is somewhat high for a class with no methods, the lack of any structural complexity, methods, or fields indicates this is likely a marker interface or very simple configuration class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
