    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.SuperClassRegistrant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 11 lines of code (loc=11) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it is already highly modularized. The lack of methods and minimal size suggests this class is properly decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
