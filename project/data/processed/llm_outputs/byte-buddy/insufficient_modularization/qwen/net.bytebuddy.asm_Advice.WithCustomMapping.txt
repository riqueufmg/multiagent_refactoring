    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithCustomMapping",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 551 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating high implementation complexity. It also has 4 fields (nof) but no methods (nom), suggesting poor decomposition where data and behavior are not properly organized. The high number of dependencies (14 external classes) indicates the class is trying to handle too many responsibilities rather than being focused on a single concern, which is a clear sign of insufficient modularization."
