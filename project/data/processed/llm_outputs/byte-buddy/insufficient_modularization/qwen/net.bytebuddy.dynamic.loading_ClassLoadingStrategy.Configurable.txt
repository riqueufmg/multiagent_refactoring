    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy.Configurable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 34 lines of code (loc=34). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While the class uses a nested class pattern (Configurable within ClassLoadingStrategy), the metrics indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The LCOM value of -1.0 is inconclusive but given the near-zero complexity metrics, insufficient modularization is not detected."
