    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ValidatingFieldVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 16 lines of code (loc=16). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. There are no dependencies on other classes within the provided data, and the class appears to be a simple visitor implementation. Given its minimal size and complexity, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
