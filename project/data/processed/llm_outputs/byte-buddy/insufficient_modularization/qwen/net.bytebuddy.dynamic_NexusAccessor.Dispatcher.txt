```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 155 lines of code (loc=155). While the LOC is moderately high for a class with few methods, the low method count and field count indicate it is already well-decomposed. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nom=0, nopm=0) suggests this is likely a data-only class or interface, and the zero complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) confirm it does not contain complex business logic that would benefit from further decomposition."
