    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and relatively small size with 44 lines of code (loc=44). The lack of methods and low field count indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit characteristics of insufficient modularization."
