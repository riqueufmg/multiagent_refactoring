    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstructorComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 37 lines of code (loc=37), with a moderate weighted method count (wmc=7). The low number of methods and relatively small size indicate sufficient modularization. No complex dependencies or high complexity metrics suggest the need for further decomposition."
