    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 57 lines of code (loc=57). With such a small number of methods and fields, and relatively compact size, there is insufficient evidence of complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or utility class with minimal implementation complexity."
