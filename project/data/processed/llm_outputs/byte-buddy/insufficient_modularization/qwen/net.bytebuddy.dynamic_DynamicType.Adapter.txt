    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Adapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (54) and a large size in terms of lines of code (1214 LOC), indicating high complexity and insufficient decomposition. The lack of methods (0) suggests that the class may be holding too much data or responsibility without proper behavioral decomposition. The high number of dependencies (34) further indicates that this class is managing too many relationships, which supports the presence of Insufficient Modularization."
