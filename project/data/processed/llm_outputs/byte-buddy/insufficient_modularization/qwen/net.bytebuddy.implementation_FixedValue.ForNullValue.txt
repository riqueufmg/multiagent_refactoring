    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 28 lines of code (loc=28). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it lacks the complexity that would require further decomposition."
