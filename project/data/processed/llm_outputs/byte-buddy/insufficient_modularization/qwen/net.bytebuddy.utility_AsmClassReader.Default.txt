    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=88 but this appears to be the file level, not class level), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). With no methods or significant functionality, there is no basis for further decomposition. The class appears to be a minimal or placeholder implementation that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
