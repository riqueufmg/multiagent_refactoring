    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 22 lines of code (loc=22). The lack of methods and low size indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple interface or abstract class with no substantial implementation that would benefit from modularization."
