    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 fields but no methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0), indicating it serves as a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring decomposition. With only 146 lines of code and no methods to analyze for complexity, there is insufficient evidence of implementation complexity that would warrant further modularization. The class appears to be appropriately simple for its purpose as a configuration holder."
