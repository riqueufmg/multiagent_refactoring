    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.ForMethodReturn",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 61 lines of code (loc=61). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on 8 other classes, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) indicates this may be a data class or configuration class rather than a complex business logic class that would benefit from further decomposition."
