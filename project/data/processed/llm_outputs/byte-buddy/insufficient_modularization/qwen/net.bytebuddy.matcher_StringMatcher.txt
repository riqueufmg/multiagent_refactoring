{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.StringMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 3 fields (nof=3), and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lines of code (loc=132) are reasonable for a class of this complexity. The lack of class dependencies (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) and good cohesion (lcom=0.0) suggest the class is well-focused and not overly complex, indicating sufficient modularization."
