    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 28 lines of code, 1 field, and 0 methods. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal functional complexity. With such low size and complexity metrics, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
