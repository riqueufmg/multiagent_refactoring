    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ReadOnly",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 32 lines of code (loc=32). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While the class exists, its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization - it appears to be a simple, well-contained class with limited functionality that does not require further decomposition."
