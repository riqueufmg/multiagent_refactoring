    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.Accessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 208 lines of code (loc=208). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The absence of dependencies and low complexity metrics indicate it does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
