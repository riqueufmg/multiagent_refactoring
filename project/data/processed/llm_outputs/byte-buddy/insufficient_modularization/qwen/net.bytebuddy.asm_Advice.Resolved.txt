    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Resolved",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 fields (nof=19) and 534 lines of code (loc=534), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential incomplete decomposition where functionality may be embedded within field initialization or nested classes rather than properly modularized methods. The high number of dependencies (12 external dependencies) indicates significant responsibilities that could benefit from further decomposition to improve modularity and reduce complexity."
