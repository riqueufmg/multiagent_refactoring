    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.WithLazyNavigation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 163 lines of code (loc=163). While the class has a relatively high number of lines of code, the low number of fields and methods suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The absence of methods (nom=0) indicates this is likely a data-only class or interface implementation, which doesn't exhibit the complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would suggest insufficient modularization."
