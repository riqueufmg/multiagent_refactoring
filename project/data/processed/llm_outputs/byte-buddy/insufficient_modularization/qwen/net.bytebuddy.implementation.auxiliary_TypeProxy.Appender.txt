    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 59 lines of code (loc=59). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal method complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest it is already sufficiently modularized for its intended purpose."
