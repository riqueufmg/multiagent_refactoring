    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.InstanceTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 26 lines of code (loc=26) and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and low complexity metrics indicate sufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused component with appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
