{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Transformer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 fields (nof=15) and 396 lines of code (loc=396), indicating high size and complexity. It also has 10 external dependencies, suggesting high implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. The class appears to be a nested class (AgentBuilder.Transformer) with significant responsibilities and dependencies, making it a candidate for further modularization to reduce its size and complexity."
