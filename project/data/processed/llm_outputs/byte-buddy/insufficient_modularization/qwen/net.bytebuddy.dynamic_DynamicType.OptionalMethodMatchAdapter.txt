    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 54 lines of code (loc=54), and minimal dependencies on 3 external classes. The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
