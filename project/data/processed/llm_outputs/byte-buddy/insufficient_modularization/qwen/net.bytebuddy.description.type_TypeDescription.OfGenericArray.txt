    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.OfGenericArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 237 lines of code (loc=237). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics indicate this is a simple data structure rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The class appears to be a specialized inner class representing generic array types, which is appropriately focused on a single responsibility."
