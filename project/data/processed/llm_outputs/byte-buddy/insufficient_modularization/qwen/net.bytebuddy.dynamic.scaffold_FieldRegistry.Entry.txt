    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldRegistry.Entry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 4 fields, 49 lines of code, and no dependencies flowing in or out (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed, and there is no evidence of implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
