    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 62 lines of code (loc=62). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal behavioral complexity. With no methods implemented in this class, there is insufficient functionality to warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or auxiliary structure rather than a complex module requiring refactoring."
