```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.EqualityMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with all being public methods (nopm=3), 1 field (nof=1), and 26 lines of code (loc=26). The low number of methods, fields, and lines of code indicate that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The WMC of 3 also indicates low complexity, and LCOM of 0.0 suggests good cohesion."
