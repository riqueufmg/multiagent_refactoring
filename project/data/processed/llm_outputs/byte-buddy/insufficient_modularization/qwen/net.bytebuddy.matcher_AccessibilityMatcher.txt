    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 1 field (nof=1), and low lines of code (loc=26). The weighted method count (wmc=3) indicates minimal method complexity. With only 3 methods where 2 are public (nopm=2), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
