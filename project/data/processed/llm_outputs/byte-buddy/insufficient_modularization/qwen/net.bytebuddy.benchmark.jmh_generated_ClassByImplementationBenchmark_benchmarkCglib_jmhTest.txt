    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 263 fields and 276 lines of code, indicating excessive size for a single class. The high number of fields (263) suggests that the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. Additionally, the class has 9 methods with a weighted method count of 42, which combined with the large number of fields, indicates high implementation complexity that could be reduced through further modularization."
