    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Generalizing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0, wmc=0) and only 49 lines of code (loc=49). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, lightweight component with no signs of insufficient modularization."
