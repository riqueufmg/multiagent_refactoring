    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 15 lines of code (loc=15), which indicates a very small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and only 2 methods, this class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
