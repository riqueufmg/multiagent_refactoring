    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForMissingType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 83 lines of code (loc=83). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of fields and methods, this appears to be a specialized inner class that represents a specific annotation value type. The low method count and field count suggest it is already well-decomposed for its purpose, and the metrics do not indicate excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
