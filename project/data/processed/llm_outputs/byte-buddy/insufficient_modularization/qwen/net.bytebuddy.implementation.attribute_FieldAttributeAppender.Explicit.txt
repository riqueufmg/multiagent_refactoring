    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 31 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and WMC of 0. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class with minimal responsibilities. There is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
