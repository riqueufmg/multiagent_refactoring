    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 13 lines of code and 0 methods, fields, or dependencies. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. All complexity metrics (WMC, NOF, NOPF, NOM, NOPM, NC, DIT, LCOM) are at minimum values, suggesting the class is already sufficiently modularized for its current scope."
