    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 66 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and no inheritance hierarchy (dit=0). While it has some dependencies on 6 other classes, the low internal complexity and size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-contained component."
