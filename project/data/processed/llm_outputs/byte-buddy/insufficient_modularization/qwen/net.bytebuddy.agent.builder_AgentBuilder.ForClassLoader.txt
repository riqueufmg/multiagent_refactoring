    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForClassLoader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 65 lines of code, zero methods (nom=0), zero fields (nof=0), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple or empty class structure that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
