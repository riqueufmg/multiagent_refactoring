```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods with a weighted method count (WMC) of 7, and 243 lines of code (LOC). It also contains multiple inner classes (NexusAccessor.CreationAction, NexusAccessor.Dispatcher) and dependencies on 14 other classes, indicating high complexity and insufficient decomposition. The high LOC and number of dependencies suggest the class could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
