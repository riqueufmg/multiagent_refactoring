    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.TypeVariableAnnotationAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 25 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 complexity metrics (WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0). The class appears to be a simple adapter with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The low number of fields (1), methods (0), and overall size (25 LOC) indicate it is already sufficiently modularized."
