    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 35 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 fanin/fanout dependencies. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and the class appears to be a simple data holder or wrapper. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already sufficiently decomposed given its minimal functionality."
