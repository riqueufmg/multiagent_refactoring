    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 263 fields and 276 lines of code, indicating excessive size for a single class. The high number of fields (263) suggests that the class contains too much data responsibility that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) of 42 further indicates high complexity. This large number of fields and methods in a single class violates the principle of sufficient modularization, as it could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more manageable components."
