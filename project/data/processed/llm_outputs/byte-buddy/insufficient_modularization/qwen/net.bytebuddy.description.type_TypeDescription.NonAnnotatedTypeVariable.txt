    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=40 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The class appears to be a simple type variable wrapper with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. No signs of high complexity or insufficient modularization are present."
