    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with a low LOC of 86. The metrics indicate a very simple class structure that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a nested class (UsingIStat within VirtualMachine) that likely serves a specific, focused purpose with minimal complexity."
