{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.UsingInstrumentation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 28 lines of code (loc=28), and weighted method count of 0 (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex module requiring refactoring."
