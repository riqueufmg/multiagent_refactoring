    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.ProcessProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 108 lines of code (loc=108). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the lack of methods and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) indicate this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current purpose."
