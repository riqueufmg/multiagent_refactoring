    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 45 lines of code (loc=45). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods present, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex implementation that needs decomposition."
