    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 51 lines of code (loc=51). With no methods and a relatively small number of fields, the class is already minimally decomposed. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates no implementation complexity to reduce. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
