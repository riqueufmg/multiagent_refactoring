    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is already minimally decomposed. With only 65 lines of code (loc=65) and no complexity (wmc=0, nc=0, lcom=-1.0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, focused implementation with no internal complexity to decompose further."
