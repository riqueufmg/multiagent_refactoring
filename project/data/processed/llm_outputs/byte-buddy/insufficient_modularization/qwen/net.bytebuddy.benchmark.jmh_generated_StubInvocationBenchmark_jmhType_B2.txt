    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 12 fields which are likely generated benchmark fields, low lines of code (loc=14), and minimal inheritance depth (dit=2). The class appears to be a generated benchmark class with simple field declarations and no complex behavior to decompose further."
