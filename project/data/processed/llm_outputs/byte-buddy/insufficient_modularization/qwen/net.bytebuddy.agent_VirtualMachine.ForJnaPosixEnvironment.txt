{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.ForJnaPosixEnvironment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 fields (nof=18) and 391 lines of code (loc=391), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The lack of methods (nom=0) despite having many fields suggests poor decomposition where functionality is likely embedded elsewhere or the class is not properly structured. The high number of fields relative to the lack of methods indicates the class likely encompasses too much responsibility and could benefit from further decomposition."
