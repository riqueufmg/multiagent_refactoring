    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=27 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). With minimal functionality and no complex relationships, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently simple and decomposed."
