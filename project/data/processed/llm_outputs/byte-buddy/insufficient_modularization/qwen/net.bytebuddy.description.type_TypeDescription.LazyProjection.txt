    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.LazyProjection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 fields (nof=19) and 597 lines of code (loc=597), indicating high size and complexity. With 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 public methods (nopm=0), the class appears to be a data-heavy structure that lacks proper decomposition into smaller, more manageable components. The high number of dependencies (8 external classes) suggests it has complex relationships that could benefit from further modularization to reduce coupling and improve maintainability."
