    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfMatchedField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 22 lines of code, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=1), and no dependencies on other classes beyond basic annotations and matchers. The low WMC (0), DIT (0), and absence of complex metrics indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
