    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ParameterDefinition",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 404 lines of code (loc), which is excessively large for a single class. The class also has 0 methods (nom) and 0 fields (nof), suggesting that the implementation complexity is concentrated in a way that could benefit from further decomposition. The high line count with no measurable methods indicates insufficient modularization where the class could be broken down into smaller, more manageable components."
