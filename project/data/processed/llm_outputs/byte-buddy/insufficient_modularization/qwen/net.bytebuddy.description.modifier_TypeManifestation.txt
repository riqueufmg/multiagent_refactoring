    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.TypeManifestation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 methods (nom=8) and 76 lines of code (loc=76), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=8) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class follows good encapsulation principles. The low LCOM value (0.375) suggests good cohesion within the class. The class has no fan-in or fan-out dependencies, indicating it's relatively isolated and focused. These metrics suggest the class is adequately modularized and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
