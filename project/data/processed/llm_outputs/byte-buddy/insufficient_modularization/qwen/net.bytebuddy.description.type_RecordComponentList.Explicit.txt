    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentList.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 36 lines of code. The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. No inheritance hierarchy exists (dit=0) and there are no dependencies, suggesting a simple, focused implementation that is already sufficiently modularized."
