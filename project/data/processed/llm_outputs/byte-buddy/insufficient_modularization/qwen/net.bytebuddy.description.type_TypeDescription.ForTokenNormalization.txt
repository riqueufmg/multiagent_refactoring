    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 attributes (nof=1, nopf=0), and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0). With only 25 lines of code (loc=25) and minimal dependencies, the class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
