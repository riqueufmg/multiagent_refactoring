    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Transitivity",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The LCOM value of 0.8 suggests good cohesion within the class. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 5 methods, the class does not exhibit excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition. The low number of methods and fields indicates sufficient modularization has already been achieved."
