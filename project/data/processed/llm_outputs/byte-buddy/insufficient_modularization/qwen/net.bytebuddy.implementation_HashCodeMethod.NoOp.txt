    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 25 lines of code (loc=25). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) indicating no method complexity. The class appears to be a simple, minimal implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
