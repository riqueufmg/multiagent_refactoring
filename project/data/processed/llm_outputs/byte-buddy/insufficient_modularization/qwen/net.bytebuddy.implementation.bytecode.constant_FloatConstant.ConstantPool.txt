{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.FloatConstant.ConstantPool",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 23 lines of code (loc=23), and minimal dependencies. The low number of fields and methods indicates proper modularization for this specific component, which appears to be a simple constant pool implementation. There is no evidence of insufficient decomposition as the class is already appropriately small and focused."
