    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin.Initializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 103 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT is 1 showing no inheritance hierarchy. While it has some dependencies (3 fan-out), the low internal complexity and minimal method count suggest it is sufficiently modularized for its current responsibilities."
