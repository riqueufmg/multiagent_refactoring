    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and very low complexity (wmc=3, loc=23). With such minimal functionality and low complexity, there is no indication that further decomposition would provide benefits. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current scope and responsibilities."
