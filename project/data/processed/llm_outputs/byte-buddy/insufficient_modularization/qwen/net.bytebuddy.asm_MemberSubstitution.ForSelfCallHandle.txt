{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForSelfCallHandle",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 fields (nof=8) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 139 lines of code (loc=139). While the class has a moderate number of fields, the lack of methods and relatively low LOC count do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition. The absence of method complexity (wmc=0) and method count (nom=0) suggests this is likely a data-only class or configuration holder rather than a complex implementation that needs modularization."
