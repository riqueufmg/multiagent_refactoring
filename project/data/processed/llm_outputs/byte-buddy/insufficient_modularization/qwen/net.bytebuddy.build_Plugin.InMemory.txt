{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.InMemory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and only 143 lines of code (loc=143). It has no public methods (nopm=0) and no fields (nof=1, nopf=0). The low method count and moderate LOC suggest it is already sufficiently decomposed. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex business logic class that would benefit from further modularization."
