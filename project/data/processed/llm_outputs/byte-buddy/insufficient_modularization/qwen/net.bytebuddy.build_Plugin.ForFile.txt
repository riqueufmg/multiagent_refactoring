    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForFile",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 40 lines of code (loc=40). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
