{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.Optional",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 16 lines of code (loc=16). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class is nested (indicated by the name containing 'Optional' as an inner class), its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization since there are no substantial methods or fields to decompose further."
