{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.FieldTokenList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond the basic field descriptions. The class appears to be a simple data structure or token holder rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
