    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.ToStringPlugin.Prefix",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=31 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0). The lack of methods and low complexity indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
