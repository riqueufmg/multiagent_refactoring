    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 85 lines of code (loc=85). While the class has some fields, the low method count and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or iterator implementation with minimal complexity (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0)."
