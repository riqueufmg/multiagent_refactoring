    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.SuperMethodCall",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (109 LOC) and complexity (WMC=4, NOM=4) for its functionality. The LCOM value of 1.0 indicates good cohesion, and the presence of nested classes (Appender, TerminationHandler, WithoutReturn) suggests appropriate internal decomposition. The metrics do not indicate excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
