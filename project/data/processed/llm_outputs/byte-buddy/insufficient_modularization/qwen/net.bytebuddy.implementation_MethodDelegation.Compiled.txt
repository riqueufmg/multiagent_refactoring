    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.Compiled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 fields (nof=7) but no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating it is likely a data-only class or placeholder. With only 181 lines of code (loc=181) and no method complexity (wmc=0), the class does not exhibit high complexity that would require further decomposition. The lack of methods suggests this is a simple data structure rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
