    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15) and 271 lines of code (loc=271), indicating high implementation complexity. It also has 3 fields (nof=3) and depends on 11 external classes (dependencies=11), suggesting it has multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
