{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForHandle",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 fields and 96 lines of code, which is relatively small. It has 0 methods, indicating it may be a data-only class or nested class with minimal complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) suggests low implementation complexity. While it has dependencies on 7 other classes, this alone does not indicate insufficient modularization since the class itself appears to be focused and compact."
