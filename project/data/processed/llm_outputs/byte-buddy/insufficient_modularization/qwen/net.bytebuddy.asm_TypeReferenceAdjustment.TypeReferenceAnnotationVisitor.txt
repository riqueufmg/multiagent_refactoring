    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeReferenceAdjustment.TypeReferenceAnnotationVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 39 lines of code (loc=39). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No other complexity metrics (nof=0, nopf=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0) suggest significant structural issues requiring modularization."
