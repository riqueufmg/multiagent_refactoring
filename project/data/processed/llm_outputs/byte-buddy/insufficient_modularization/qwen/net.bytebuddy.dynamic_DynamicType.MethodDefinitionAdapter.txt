{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.MethodDefinitionAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 188 lines of code (loc=188). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of fields, the lack of methods and the fact that it appears to be an adapter class suggests it may be serving a specific, focused purpose. Without seeing the actual implementation details, the metrics alone do not provide sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization, as the class could be a simple data holder or adapter with a compact, well-defined responsibility."
