    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 58 lines of code (loc), which is relatively small. It has 0 methods (nom) and 0 fields (nof), indicating minimal complexity. The weighted method count (wmc) is 0, showing no method complexity issues. The lack of methods and low loc count suggests this is likely an abstract base class providing minimal functionality rather than a case of insufficient modularization."
