    "justification": "The class has 138 lines of code which is relatively small, and all structural metrics (nof, nopf, nom, nopm, wmc, nc, dit, lcom, fanin, fanout) are 0 or -1 indicating minimal complexity. The class appears to be a simple enum or utility class with low complexity that does not require further decomposition."
