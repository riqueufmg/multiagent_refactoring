    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.MethodExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 fields (nof=19) and 172 lines of code (loc=172), indicating high size and complexity for a single class. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests that functionality may be implemented directly in fields or through complex nested structures rather than proper method decomposition. This concentration of fields and logic without adequate modularization through methods indicates insufficient decomposition of responsibilities."
