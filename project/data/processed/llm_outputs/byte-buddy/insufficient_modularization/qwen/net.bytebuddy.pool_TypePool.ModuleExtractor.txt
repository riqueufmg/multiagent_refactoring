    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ModuleExtractor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 fields and 81 lines of code, which is relatively small. It has no methods (nom=0) and no dependencies on other classes beyond the two imported types. The low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0) indicate minimal implementation complexity. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, its size and complexity are not excessive enough to constitute insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
