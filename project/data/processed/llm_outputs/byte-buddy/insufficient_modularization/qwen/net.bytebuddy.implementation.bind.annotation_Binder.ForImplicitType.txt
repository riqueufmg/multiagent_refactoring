    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.ForImplicitType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies on other classes within the provided data. Given the minimal size and complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed."
