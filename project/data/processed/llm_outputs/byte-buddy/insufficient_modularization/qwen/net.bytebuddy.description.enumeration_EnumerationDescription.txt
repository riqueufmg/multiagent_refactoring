    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.enumeration.EnumerationDescription",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3) and 3 fields (nof=3), low weighted method count (wmc=3), single level of inheritance (dit=1), and reasonable lines of code (loc=138). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity metrics, indicates adequate modularization without need for further decomposition."
