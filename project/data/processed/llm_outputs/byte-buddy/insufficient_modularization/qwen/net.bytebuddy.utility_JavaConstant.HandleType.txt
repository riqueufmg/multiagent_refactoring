{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.HandleType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=127 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The class appears to be a simple enum or constant class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. While it has 2 fields and depends on 2 external classes, the lack of methods and complexity indicates sufficient modularization."
