    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.AnnotationToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 109 lines of code (loc=109). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is likely a simple data holder or token class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its current functionality."
