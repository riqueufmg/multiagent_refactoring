{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Negation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 40 lines of code (loc=40), and weighted method count of 3 (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=1) and low LCOM value (0.667) suggest reasonable cohesion. With only 3 methods and minimal dependencies, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
