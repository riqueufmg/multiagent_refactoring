    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 113 fields (nof=113) and 3402 lines of code (loc=3402), indicating excessive size and complexity for a single class. The high number of dependencies (34 external classes) suggests it has too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The lack of methods (nom=0) despite high field count suggests potential issues with encapsulation and modularity."
