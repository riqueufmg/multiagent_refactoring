    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.GraalImageCode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods (4 public) and 125 lines of code. The WMC of 12 indicates reasonable method complexity. With only 3 fields and 0.5 LCOM, the class shows good cohesion. The low number of methods and fields, combined with moderate complexity metrics, does not indicate insufficient modularization."
