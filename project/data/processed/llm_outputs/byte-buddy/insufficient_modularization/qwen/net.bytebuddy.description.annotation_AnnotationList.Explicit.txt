    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 47 lines of code. The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. No dependencies suggest simple isolated behavior."
