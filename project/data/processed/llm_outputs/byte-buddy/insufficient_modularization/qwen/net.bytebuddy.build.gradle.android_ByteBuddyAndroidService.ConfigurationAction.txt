{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidService.ConfigurationAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 22 lines of code (loc=22). With no methods present, there is no implementation complexity to decompose further, and the class size is minimal. The lack of methods and low LOC indicates sufficient modularization has already been achieved."
