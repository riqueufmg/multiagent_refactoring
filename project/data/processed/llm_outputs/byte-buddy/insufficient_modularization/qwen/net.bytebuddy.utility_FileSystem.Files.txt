    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem.Files",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 38 lines of code (loc=38). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While the class depends on JavaDispatcher, the minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization - there is no evidence of incomplete decomposition or excessive size that would benefit from further breakdown."
