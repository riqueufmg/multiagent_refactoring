    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0), 128 lines of code (loc=128), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
