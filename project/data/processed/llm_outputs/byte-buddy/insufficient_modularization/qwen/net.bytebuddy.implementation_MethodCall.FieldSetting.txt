    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 65 lines of code (loc=65). It has minimal dependencies with only 1 field (nof=1) and no parameters (nopf=0). The low method count and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization for this class's current responsibilities."
