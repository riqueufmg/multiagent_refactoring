```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 5 methods (3 public), 8 fields, and WMC of 14. While it contains nested classes (ForPrimitiveType, ArrayCreator), the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The LCOM value of 0.4 suggests reasonable cohesion, and the class appears to have a focused responsibility around array factory operations."
