    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.RecordComponentMatchAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 56 lines of code (loc=56). With minimal complexity metrics (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0, nc=0) and no fanin/fanout dependencies, this class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate it is a simple data holder rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
