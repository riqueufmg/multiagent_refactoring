    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 22 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). The metrics indicate minimal implementation complexity and size, suggesting the class is already sufficiently decomposed. No evidence of incomplete decomposition or excessive size/complexity that would warrant further modularization."
