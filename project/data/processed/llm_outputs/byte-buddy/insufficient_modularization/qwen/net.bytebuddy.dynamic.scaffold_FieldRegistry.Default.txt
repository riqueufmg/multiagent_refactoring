    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldRegistry.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 fields (nof=11) and 190 lines of code (loc=190), which indicates moderate complexity but not excessive size. With a depth of inheritance of 1 (dit=1), it's a direct implementation without deep inheritance chains. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) suggest this might be a data-only class or interface implementation rather than a complex business logic class. The negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) indicates good cohesion among the fields. While the class has some complexity due to its size and dependencies, the metrics do not clearly indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to serve a specific purpose within the field registry functionality."
