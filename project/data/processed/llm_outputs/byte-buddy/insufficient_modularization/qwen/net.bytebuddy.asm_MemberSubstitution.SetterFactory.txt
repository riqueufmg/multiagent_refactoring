    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.SetterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 42 lines of code (loc=42). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal complexity. The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0), suggesting no method complexity. With such few responsibilities and low complexity, there is insufficient evidence to suggest the class requires further decomposition."
