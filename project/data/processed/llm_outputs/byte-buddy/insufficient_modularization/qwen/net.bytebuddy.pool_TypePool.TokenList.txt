    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.TokenList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a low lines of code count (loc=40). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and simple field structure suggests it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data structure or token container with minimal complexity that does not require further decomposition."
