    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.DefaultMethodCall.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 0 public methods (nopm=0). The lines of code (loc=62) are relatively small, weighted method count (wmc=0) indicates no complex methods, nesting complexity (nc=0) is minimal, and depth of inheritance tree (dit=1) shows no deep inheritance. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant classification as Insufficient Modularization."
