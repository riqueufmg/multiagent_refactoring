    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyJarsTask",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 14 methods (nom) and 19 weighted method count (wmc), which is manageable. The lines of code (loc) at 124 is reasonable for a Gradle task implementation. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low depth of inheritance (dit=1) suggests it's not overly coupled. The LCOM value of 0.286 indicates reasonable cohesion, and with only 4 fields (nof) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its purpose as a Gradle task."
