    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 198 methods (nom=198, nopm=197) and 1785 lines of code (loc=1785), indicating excessive size and complexity. With 207 weighted method count (wmc=207), the class exhibits high implementation complexity. The large number of dependencies (22 external types) suggests multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into separate modules. The absence of fields (nof=0) and low cohesion indicators suggest this class could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and complexity."
