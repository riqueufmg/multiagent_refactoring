    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 fields (nof=10) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 117 lines of code (loc=117). While the class has a moderate number of fields, the low method count and relatively contained size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a specialized, lightweight component with focused responsibilities."
