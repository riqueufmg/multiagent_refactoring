    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForEnumerationDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 247 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it may contain too much functionality. It has 7 fields (nof) but no methods (nom=0), suggesting poor decomposition where data and behavior are not properly organized. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) combined with substantial size indicates insufficient modularization where the class likely contains embedded logic that should be decomposed into separate methods or classes. The WMC of 0 further suggests inadequate method decomposition."
