{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.TransformationDispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 150 lines of code (loc=150). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and lack of complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) suggest this is likely a data-only class or simple dispatcher. The dependencies on two enhancer tasks indicate focused responsibility. Insufficient modularization typically requires higher complexity and method count to be detected reliably."
