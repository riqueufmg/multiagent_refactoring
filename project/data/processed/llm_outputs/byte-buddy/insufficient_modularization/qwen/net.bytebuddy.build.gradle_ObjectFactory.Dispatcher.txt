    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ObjectFactory.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 71 lines of code (loc=71). While the class has some code, the low method count and simple structure do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or dispatcher with minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
