{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Openness",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to be well-focused and not overly complex. The LCOM value of 0.8 indicates some lack of cohesion, but given the small size and low complexity, further decomposition would likely not provide significant benefits."
