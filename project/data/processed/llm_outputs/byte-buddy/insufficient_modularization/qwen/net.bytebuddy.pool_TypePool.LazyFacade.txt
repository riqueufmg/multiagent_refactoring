    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyFacade",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 91 lines of code (loc=91). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and lack of complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) suggest this is a simple data class or facade. The absence of methods indicates it's likely a straightforward container or lazy initialization wrapper rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
