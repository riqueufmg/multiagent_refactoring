    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin.ExitAdviceByteCodeAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lines of code (loc=62) are reasonable for a specialized byte code appender class. The class has minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance (dit=1), indicating it is already well-decomposed and focused on a single responsibility."
