    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=36 but this appears to be the file loc not class loc), and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0). The class appears to be a simple enum or data class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. No evidence of high complexity or size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
