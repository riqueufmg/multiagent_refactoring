    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodRebaseResolver.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 0 public methods (nopm=0). The lines of code (loc=74) are relatively small, weighted method count (wmc=0) indicates no complex methods, nesting complexity (nc=0) is minimal, and depth of inheritance (dit=1) shows no inheritance hierarchy. The lack of methods and low complexity metrics indicate this class is already sufficiently modularized."
