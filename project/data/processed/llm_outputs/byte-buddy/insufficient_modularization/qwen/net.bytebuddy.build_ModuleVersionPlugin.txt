    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (39 LOC, 5 methods) and complexity (WMC=5) for its functionality. The LCOM value of 0.8 indicates good cohesion within the class. With only 1 field and 5 methods all being public, the class appears to have appropriate modularization for its intended purpose as a plugin implementation."
