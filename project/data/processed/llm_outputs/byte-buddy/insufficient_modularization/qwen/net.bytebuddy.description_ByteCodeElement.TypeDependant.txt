    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 18 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies or coupling metrics indicating complexity. The lack of structural complexity and size does not indicate insufficient modularization."
