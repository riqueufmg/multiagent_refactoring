    "justification": "The class has 27 fields (nof=27) and 449 lines of code (loc=449), indicating high size and complexity. With 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 public methods (nopm=0), this suggests the class may be an interface or abstract class that could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its structural complexity and improve modularity."
