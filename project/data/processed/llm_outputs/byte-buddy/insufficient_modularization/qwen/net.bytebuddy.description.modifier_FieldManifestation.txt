    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.FieldManifestation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7) and 63 lines of code (loc=63), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=7) is low, indicating low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be well-focused. The low LCOM value (0.4285714285714285) suggests good cohesion among methods. The class has no fan-in or fan-out dependencies, indicating it's relatively isolated and simple. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
