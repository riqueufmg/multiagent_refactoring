    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.ByteBuddyViewConfiguration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 34 lines of code (loc=34). It also has minimal dependencies with 0 fanin and 0 fanout. The low number of methods and low complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
