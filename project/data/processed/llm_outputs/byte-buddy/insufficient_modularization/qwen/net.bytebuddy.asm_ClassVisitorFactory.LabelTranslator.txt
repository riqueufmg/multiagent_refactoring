{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.LabelTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 55 lines of code (loc=55), and a depth of inheritance of 1 (dit=1). The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low field count indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
