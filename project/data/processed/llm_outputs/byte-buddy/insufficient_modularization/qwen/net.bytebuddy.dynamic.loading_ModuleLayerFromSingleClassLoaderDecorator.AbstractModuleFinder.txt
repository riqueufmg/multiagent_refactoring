    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.AbstractModuleFinder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 37 lines of code (loc=37), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of fields and methods, combined with the relatively small size (37 LOC), indicates that the class is already sufficiently modularized. There is no evidence of incomplete decomposition or excessive complexity that would warrant further breakdown."
