    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyTokenList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 fields (nof=10) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 108 lines of code (loc=108). While the class has a moderate number of fields, the lack of methods and relatively simple structure (wmc=0, nc=0) suggests it may not be sufficiently complex to warrant further decomposition. The absence of method complexity metrics and low coupling indicators suggest this class is likely already at an appropriate level of modularization."
