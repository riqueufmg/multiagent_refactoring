{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription.Latent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 92 lines of code (loc=92). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal behavioral complexity. While the class has 4 dependencies, the low internal complexity and small size do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately focused on its latent annotation description responsibility."
