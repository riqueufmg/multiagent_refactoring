    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.ClassByExtensionBenchmark.ByteBuddyPrefixInterceptor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 16 lines of code (loc=16). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. There are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance (dit=0). Given the extremely low size and complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed and minimal in nature."
