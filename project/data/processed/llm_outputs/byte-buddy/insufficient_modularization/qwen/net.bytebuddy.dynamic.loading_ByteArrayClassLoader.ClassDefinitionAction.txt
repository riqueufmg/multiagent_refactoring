    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.ClassDefinitionAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 42 lines of code (loc=42), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). While the class has a relatively small number of methods, it also has low complexity and size. The lack of methods suggests it may be a simple data holder or action class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. Without evidence of high complexity or large size that would benefit from decomposition, insufficient modularization cannot be confirmed."
