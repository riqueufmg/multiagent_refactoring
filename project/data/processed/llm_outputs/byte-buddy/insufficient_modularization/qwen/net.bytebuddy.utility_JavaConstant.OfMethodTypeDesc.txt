    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 30 lines of code (loc=30). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies on other classes within the provided data. The class appears to be a simple, well-decomposed unit with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
