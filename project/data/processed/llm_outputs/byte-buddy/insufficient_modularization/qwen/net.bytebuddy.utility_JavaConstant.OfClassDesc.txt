    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple, well-decomposed unit with no evidence of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
