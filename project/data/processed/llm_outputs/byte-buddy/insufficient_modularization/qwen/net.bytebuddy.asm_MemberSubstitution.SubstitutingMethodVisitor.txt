{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.SubstitutingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 fields (nof=12) and 234 lines of code (loc=234), which indicates a moderate size. With 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 public methods (nopm=0), the class appears to be a specialized visitor implementation. The low number of methods relative to fields suggests it may be a data-focused class rather than a behaviorally complex one. While the LOC count is somewhat high, the metrics do not clearly indicate insufficient modularization as the class seems to serve a specific focused purpose within the ASM framework."
