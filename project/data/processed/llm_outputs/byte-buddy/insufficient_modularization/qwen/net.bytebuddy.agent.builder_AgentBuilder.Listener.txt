    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Listener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a moderate size of 400 lines of code (loc=400). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics indicate this is likely an interface or abstract class that is properly modularized. The class does not exhibit high complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
