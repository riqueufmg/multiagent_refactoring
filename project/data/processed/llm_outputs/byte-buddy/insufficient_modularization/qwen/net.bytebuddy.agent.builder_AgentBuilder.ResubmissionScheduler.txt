    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ResubmissionScheduler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 158 lines of code (loc=158). While the class has a relatively high number of fields, the lack of methods and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) indicate it may be serving a simple data container or configuration role rather than being insufficiently modularized. The metrics do not clearly indicate complex functionality that needs further decomposition."
