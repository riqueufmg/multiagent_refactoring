{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.Dispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 fields (nof=15) and 501 lines of code (loc=501), indicating high size and complexity. With no methods (nom=0) and no inheritance (dit=0), this suggests the class may contain excessive functionality that could be decomposed into smaller, more manageable modules. The high number of fields and large size suggest insufficient modularization where further decomposition could reduce complexity."
