{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 33 fields (nof=33) and 899 lines of code (loc=899), indicating high size and potential complexity. It also has 5 methods (nom=5) with a low method-to-field ratio, suggesting insufficient decomposition. The class directly depends on 17 other classes (high fanout=0 but high dependency count), indicating it handles multiple responsibilities. The presence of nested classes like ParameterDescription.Parameter and ParameterDescription.Token further suggests that the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
