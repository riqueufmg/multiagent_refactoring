    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Transformation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 fields (nof=16) and 221 lines of code (loc=221), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential incomplete decomposition where functionality may be embedded in anonymous classes or nested implementations rather than properly modularized methods. The high field count relative to methods indicates insufficient modularization as the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that should be separated into distinct modules."
