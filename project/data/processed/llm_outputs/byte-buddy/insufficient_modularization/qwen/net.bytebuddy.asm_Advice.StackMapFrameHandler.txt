{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.StackMapFrameHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 fields (nof=17) and 941 lines of code (loc=941), indicating high size and complexity. With no methods (nom=0) and no public methods (nopm=0), the class appears to be a data-heavy class that lacks proper decomposition into smaller, more manageable components. The high number of fields combined with substantial lines of code suggests insufficient modularization where the class could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more focused classes."
