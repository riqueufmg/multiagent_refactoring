    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.SerializedConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (3 total, 1 public), low lines of code (55), low weighted method count (4), and no class dependencies. The metrics indicate a relatively simple class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
