{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 116 fields (nof=116) and 4286 lines of code (loc=4286), indicating excessive size and complexity for a single class. The lack of methods (nom=1) with high field count suggests poor decomposition, as the class likely encapsulates too much responsibility without proper modularization. The high number of dependencies (36 listed) further supports that this class handles too many concerns and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
