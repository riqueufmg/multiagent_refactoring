    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 fields (nof=8) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 114 lines of code (loc=114). While the class has a moderate number of fields, the lack of methods and relatively low LOC count do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data structure or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
