    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy.SilentConstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 fields (nof=14) and 105 lines of code (loc=105), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. It has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), suggesting it is likely a data-only class or very simple implementation. The low number of fields and absence of complex method implementations suggest the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
