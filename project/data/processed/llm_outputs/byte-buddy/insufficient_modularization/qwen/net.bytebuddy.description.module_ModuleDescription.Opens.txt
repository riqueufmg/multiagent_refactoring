    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription.Opens",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 23 lines of code (loc=23). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While the class has dependencies on ModifierReviewable and JavaDispatcher, its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data structure or interface implementation rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
