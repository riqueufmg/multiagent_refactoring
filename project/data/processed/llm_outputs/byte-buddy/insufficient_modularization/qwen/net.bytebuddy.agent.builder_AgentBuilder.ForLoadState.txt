    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 27 lines of code (loc=27), and weighted method count of 0 (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low structural complexity indicates it is already sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
