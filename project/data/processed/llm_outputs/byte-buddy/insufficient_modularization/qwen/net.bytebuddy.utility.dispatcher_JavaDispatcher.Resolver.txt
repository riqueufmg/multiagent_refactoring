    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.Resolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 93 lines of code (loc=93). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further modularization."
