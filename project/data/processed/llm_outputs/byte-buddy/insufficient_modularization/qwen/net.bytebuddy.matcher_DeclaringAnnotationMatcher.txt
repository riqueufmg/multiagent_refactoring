    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.DeclaringAnnotationMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 2 public methods (nopm=2), with a low weighted method count (wmc=3) and only 26 lines of code (loc=26). The low number of methods and complexity metrics indicate that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
