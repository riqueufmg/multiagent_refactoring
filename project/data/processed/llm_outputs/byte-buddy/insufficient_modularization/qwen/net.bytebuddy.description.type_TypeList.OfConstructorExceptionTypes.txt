    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with a low LOC of 75. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal complexity. While the class name suggests it might be a nested class handling constructor exception types, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its limited scope and low complexity metrics."
