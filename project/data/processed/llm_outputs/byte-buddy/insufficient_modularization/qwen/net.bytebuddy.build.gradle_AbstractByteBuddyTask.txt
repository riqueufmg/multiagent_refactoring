    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 32 methods (nom), 50 weighted method count (wmc), and 474 lines of code (loc). It also has multiple responsibilities as indicated by its dependencies on various classes like Transformation, Discovery, ClassFileLocator, Plugin, etc., suggesting it could be further decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
