    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods (nom=9) and 16 weighted method count (wmc=16), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The lines of code (loc=134) is not excessive for a class with bytecode manipulation functionality. The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low coupling (lcom=0.778) suggest reasonable modularization. The class appears to have a focused responsibility for duplication operations in bytecode manipulation."
