    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 22 lines of code (loc). It has minimal dependencies with only 2 fanout connections and no fanin. The low size and complexity metrics indicate this class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
