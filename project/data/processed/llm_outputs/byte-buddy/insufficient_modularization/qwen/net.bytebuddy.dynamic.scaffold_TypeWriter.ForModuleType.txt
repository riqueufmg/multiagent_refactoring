    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForModuleType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 99 lines of code which is relatively small, and all metrics show zero values (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) indicating minimal complexity and no dependencies. The lack of methods and fields suggests this class is already well-decomposed or is a simple data holder."
