    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer.WithDelegation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 358 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating high implementation complexity. The class has 7 fields (nof) but no methods (nom=0), suggesting poor decomposition where functionality may be embedded in complex field initializations or external dependencies. The high number of dependencies (9) indicates the class is trying to orchestrate multiple concerns rather than being focused on a single responsibility, supporting the need for further decomposition."
