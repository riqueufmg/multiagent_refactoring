    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.ArgumentTypeResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC=15) and Lines of Code (LOC=203) with only 3 methods, indicating high implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. The high LOC count suggests the class contains substantial logic that could be better modularized into smaller, more focused components."
