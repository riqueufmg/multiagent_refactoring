    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.ExtractableView",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 68 lines of code (loc=68). The lack of methods and low field count indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No other complexity metrics (no inheritance depth, no coupling metrics) suggest insufficient modularization."
