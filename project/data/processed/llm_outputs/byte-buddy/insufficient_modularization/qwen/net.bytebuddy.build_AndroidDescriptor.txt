    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AndroidDescriptor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 48 lines of code (loc=48), which indicates a very small and simple class. The low number of methods and low cyclomatic complexity suggest that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class has minimal complexity with only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no inheritance (dit=0)."
