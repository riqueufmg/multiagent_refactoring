    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 5 weighted method count (wmc=5), and 33 lines of code (loc=33). It has only 1 field (nof=1) and no class-level dependencies (nc=0, dit=0). The low method count, low complexity metrics, and minimal size indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
