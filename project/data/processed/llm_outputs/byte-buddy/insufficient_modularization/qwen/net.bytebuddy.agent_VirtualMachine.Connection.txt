    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.Connection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 35 fields and 1004 lines of code, indicating high size and complexity. With 9 public fields and no methods, the class lacks proper decomposition and encapsulation. The high number of fields suggests that the class could benefit from further modularization by splitting related fields into separate cohesive units or classes."
