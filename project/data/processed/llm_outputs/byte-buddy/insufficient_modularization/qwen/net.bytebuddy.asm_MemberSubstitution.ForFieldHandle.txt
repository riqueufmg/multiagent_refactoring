    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForFieldHandle",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 fields (nof=12) and 304 lines of code (loc=304), indicating high complexity and size that could benefit from further decomposition. The class appears to be a nested class handling field substitution logic which could be further modularized to reduce its implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
