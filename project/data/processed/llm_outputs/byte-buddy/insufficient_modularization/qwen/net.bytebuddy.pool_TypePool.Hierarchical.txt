    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Hierarchical",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 36 lines of code, 1 field, and 0 methods. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple hierarchical type pool implementation without sufficient complexity to warrant further decomposition."
