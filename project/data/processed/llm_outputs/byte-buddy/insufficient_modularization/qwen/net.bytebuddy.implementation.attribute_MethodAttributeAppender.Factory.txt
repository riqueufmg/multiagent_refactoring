    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 52 lines of code (loc=52). It has minimal responsibilities with 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields or methods (nopf=0, nopm=0). The low complexity metrics and minimal size indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
