    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of fields (2), methods (5), and lines of code (88), with a simple complexity measure (WMC=7). The low LCOM value (0.4) indicates good cohesion among class members. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains a reasonable size and complexity for its functionality, with no indication that further decomposition would provide significant benefits."
