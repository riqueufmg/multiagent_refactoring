{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForInstrumentation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 fields (nof=16) and 475 lines of code (loc=475), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient decomposition. The class embeds multiple dependencies (5 external dependencies) which further indicates it likely contains functionality that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes. The high line count combined with multiple fields suggests the class handles too many responsibilities and could benefit from further modularization to reduce implementation complexity."
