    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 39 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0). The lack of methods and low size indicates it is already sufficiently modularized. No further decomposition would provide meaningful reduction in size or complexity."
