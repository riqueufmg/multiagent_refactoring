    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 26 lines of code (loc=26), and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. No signs of insufficient modularization are present given the minimal scope and complexity of this class."
