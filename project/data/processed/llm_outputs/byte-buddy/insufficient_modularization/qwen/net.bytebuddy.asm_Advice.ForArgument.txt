    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForArgument",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 251 lines of code (loc) and 14 fields (nof), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom: 0) suggests potential insufficient modularization where functionality may be embedded within field definitions or inline code rather than properly decomposed into separate methods. The high line count combined with significant field count and zero methods indicates the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
