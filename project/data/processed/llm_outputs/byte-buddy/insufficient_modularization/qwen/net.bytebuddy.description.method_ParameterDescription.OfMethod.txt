    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription.OfMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 35 lines of code (loc=35). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. While it has dependencies on 3 other classes, this is not sufficient evidence for insufficient modularization given the class's minimal internal complexity."
