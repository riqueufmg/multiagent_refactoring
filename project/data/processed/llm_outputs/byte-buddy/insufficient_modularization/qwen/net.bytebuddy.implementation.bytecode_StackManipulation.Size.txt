    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation.Size",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields and 1 public field, with 0 methods and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0). The LOC is 57 which is relatively small. There are no signs of high complexity or large size that would indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or value object with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
