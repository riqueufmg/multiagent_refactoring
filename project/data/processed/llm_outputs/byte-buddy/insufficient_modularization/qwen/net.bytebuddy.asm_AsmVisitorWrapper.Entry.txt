    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.Entry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=37 but this appears to be the file loc not class loc), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or entry class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. The low metric values indicate insufficient complexity to warrant modularization concerns."
