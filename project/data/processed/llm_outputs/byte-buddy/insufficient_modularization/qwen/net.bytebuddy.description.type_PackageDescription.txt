    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2), 6 fields (nof=6), and 126 lines of code. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low number of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple data structure or value object with focused responsibilities."
