{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low lines of code (loc=32). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple dispatcher implementation with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
