    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner.IsAssignableToVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 336 lines of code (loc=336). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is likely a simple data holder or visitor implementation rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The low number of dependencies (3) and absence of fan-in/fan-out also indicate limited complexity that would necessitate modularization."
