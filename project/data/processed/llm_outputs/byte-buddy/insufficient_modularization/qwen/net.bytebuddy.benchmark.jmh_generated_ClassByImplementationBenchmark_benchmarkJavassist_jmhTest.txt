    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a moderate size with 276 lines of code and 263 fields, but only 9 methods with low complexity (WMC=42). The low number of methods relative to fields suggests it may be a data-heavy class rather than a behaviorally complex one. Without evidence of high internal complexity or clear decomposition opportunities, insufficient modularization cannot be confirmed based on the provided metrics alone."
