    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.SuperTypeLoading",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 fields (nof=10) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 198 lines of code (loc=198). While the class has a moderate number of fields, the lack of methods and relatively low LOC count do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a data structure or configuration class rather than a complex business logic class that needs further decomposition."
