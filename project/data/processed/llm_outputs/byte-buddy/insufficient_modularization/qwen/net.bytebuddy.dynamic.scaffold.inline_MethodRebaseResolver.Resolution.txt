    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodRebaseResolver.Resolution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 fields (nof=9) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 305 lines of code (loc=305). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of fields, this appears to be a data class or value object that holds configuration/data rather than a complex implementation class. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) suggests this is not a behaviorally complex class that needs further decomposition. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further modularization."
