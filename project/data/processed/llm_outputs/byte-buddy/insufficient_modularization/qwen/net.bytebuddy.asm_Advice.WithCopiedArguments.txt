{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithCopiedArguments",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0, wmc=0) and only 27 lines of code (loc=27). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. While this appears to be a nested class based on the naming convention, its current size and complexity are insufficient to constitute Insufficient Modularization."
