```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Initial",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low lines of code (loc=70). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no internal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal functionality that would benefit from further decomposition, and the low LOC suggests the class is already sufficiently small and simple."
