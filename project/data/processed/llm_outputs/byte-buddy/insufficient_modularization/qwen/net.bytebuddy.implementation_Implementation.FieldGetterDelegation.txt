    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 39 lines of code (loc=39). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof=1) and no parameters. The low metric values indicate proper modularization rather than insufficient decomposition."
