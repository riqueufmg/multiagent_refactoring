    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.Target",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 48 lines of code (loc=48). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate sufficient modularization for this class's current purpose."
