{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 0 public methods (nopm=0). The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The weighted method count (wmc=0) and lack of internal complexity metrics suggest this is a simple data holder or token class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
