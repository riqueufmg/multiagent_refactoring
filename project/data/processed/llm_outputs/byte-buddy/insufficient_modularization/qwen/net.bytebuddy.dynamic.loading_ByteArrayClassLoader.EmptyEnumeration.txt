    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.EmptyEnumeration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is already minimally decomposed. With only 19 lines of code (loc=19) and no complexity (wmc=0), the class is too small to benefit from further decomposition. It appears to be a simple enumeration implementation that is already sufficiently modularized."
