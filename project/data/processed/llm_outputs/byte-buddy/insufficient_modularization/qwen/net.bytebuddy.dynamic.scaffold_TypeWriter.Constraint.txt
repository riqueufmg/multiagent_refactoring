{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Constraint",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 1022 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The class has 5 fields (nof) but no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), suggesting it may be a data-heavy class that lacks proper behavioral decomposition. The high line count combined with minimal method count indicates insufficient modularization where the class could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more manageable components."
