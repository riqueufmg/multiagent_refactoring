    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 27 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond basic utility classes. The size and complexity are minimal, not warranting further decomposition."
