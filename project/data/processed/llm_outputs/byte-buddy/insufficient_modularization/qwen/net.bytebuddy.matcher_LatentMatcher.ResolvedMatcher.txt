{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher.ResolvedMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 22 lines of code (loc=22), and a Weighted Method Count of 0 (wmc=0). The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
