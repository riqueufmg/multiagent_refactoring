    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 12 fields (nof=12, nopf=12), and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods to decompose and very low overall complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
