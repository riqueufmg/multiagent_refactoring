    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingUnsafeInjection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 201 lines of code (loc=201). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and field count do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a specialized injector implementation with minimal complexity (wmc=0, nc=0). The lack of methods suggests it may be a data-only class or uses inherited functionality, but does not demonstrate the characteristics of insufficient modularization which requires complex, multi-responsibility classes that need decomposition."
