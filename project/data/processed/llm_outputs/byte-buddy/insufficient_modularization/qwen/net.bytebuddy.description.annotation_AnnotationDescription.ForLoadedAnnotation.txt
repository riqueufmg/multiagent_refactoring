    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription.ForLoadedAnnotation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 192 lines of code (loc) which is relatively large for a single class, and it has 3 fields (nof) with no methods (nom) or constructors (nc), indicating poor internal decomposition. The class also has 6 dependencies (dependencies) suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) combined with the substantial size (192 loc) and multiple dependencies indicates insufficient modularization where further decomposition could reduce complexity."
