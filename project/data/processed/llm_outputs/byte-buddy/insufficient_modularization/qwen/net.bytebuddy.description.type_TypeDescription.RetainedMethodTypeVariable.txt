    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.RetainedMethodTypeVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
