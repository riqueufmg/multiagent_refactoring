    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.SynchronizationStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 155 lines of code (loc=155). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is likely an enumeration or simple data structure rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The absence of inheritance (dit=0) and coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) further indicate this is a simple, self-contained class that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
