{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveTypeAwareAssigner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 33 lines of code (loc=33), with a low weighted method count (wmc=5). The class directly uses 7 dependencies but this is not excessive given its small size. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains good encapsulation. The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion, and the depth of inheritance tree (dit=1) shows it's not part of a complex hierarchy. The metrics suggest appropriate modularization for a class of this size and complexity."
