    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender.ForInstrumentedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 58 lines of code, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), and no dependencies on other classes beyond the immediate parent and annotation appender. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal complexity, and DIT of 1 shows it's at the root of the hierarchy. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately simple and focused."
