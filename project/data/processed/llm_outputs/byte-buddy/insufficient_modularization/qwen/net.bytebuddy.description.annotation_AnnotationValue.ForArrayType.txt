{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForArrayType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 240 lines of code (loc=240) which indicates high implementation complexity and size. With no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), this suggests the class has not been properly decomposed into smaller, more manageable components. The high line count combined with zero measurable methods indicates insufficient modularization where the class likely contains complex logic that should be broken down into smaller, more focused classes or methods."
