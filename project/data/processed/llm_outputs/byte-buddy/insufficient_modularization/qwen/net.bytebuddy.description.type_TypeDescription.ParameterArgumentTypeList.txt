    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 34 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no public or private methods to suggest implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple data structure or wrapper class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
