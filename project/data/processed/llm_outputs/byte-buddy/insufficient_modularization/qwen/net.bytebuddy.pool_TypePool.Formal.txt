    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Formal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 fields (nof=12) and 145 lines of code (loc=145), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) suggests it may be a data-only class or interface, and the zero values for WMC, NC, DIT, and fan-in/fan-out metrics indicate minimal complexity. While the class contains some fields, its size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization - it appears to be appropriately sized for its purpose."
