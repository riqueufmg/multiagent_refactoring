    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields and 213 lines of code, which is not excessive for a single class. The lack of methods (nom=0) and absence of complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) suggest this may be a data-only class or interface rather than a complex implementation that needs decomposition. Without evidence of high complexity, large method count, or clear functional responsibilities that could be separated, there is insufficient evidence to conclude insufficient modularization exists."
