    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.PackageLookupStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 78 lines of code (loc=78). It has minimal functionality with only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields or methods (nopf=0, nopm=0). The lack of methods and low complexity indicates it is already sufficiently decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
