    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 17 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT is 1 showing no deep inheritance. The class appears to be a simple abstract base class with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
