    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 20 fields (nof=20) and 556 lines of code (loc=556), indicating high size and complexity. It also has only 2 methods (nom=2) to manage this large number of fields, suggesting insufficient decomposition. The high field count suggests multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
