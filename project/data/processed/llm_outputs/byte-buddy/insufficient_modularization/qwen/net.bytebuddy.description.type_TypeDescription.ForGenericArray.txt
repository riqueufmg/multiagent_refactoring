    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForGenericArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal size (loc=46), and no internal dependencies (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0). The negative LCOM value (-1.0) indicates good cohesion, and zero fan-in and fan-out suggest minimal coupling. This class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple nature and limited responsibilities."
