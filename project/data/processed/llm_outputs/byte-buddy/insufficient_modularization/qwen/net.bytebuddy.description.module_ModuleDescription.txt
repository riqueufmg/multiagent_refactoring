{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 fields (nof=28) and 931 lines of code (loc=931), indicating high size and complexity. It also contains multiple inner classes (ModuleDescriptor, Opens, Exports, Optional, Module, Requires, Provides) which suggests insufficient decomposition. The high number of fields and large LOC suggest the class could benefit from further modularization to reduce complexity."
