{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.Transformation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) with 9 being public (nopm=9), 4 fields (nof=4), and 103 lines of code (loc=103). The Weighted Method Count (wmc=11) indicates low complexity. The class appears to be reasonably focused with a clear responsibility related to transformation logic in the Android Gradle plugin context. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class maintains a cohesive purpose with manageable complexity."
