    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodAccessorFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 79 lines of code (loc=79), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 2 nested classes (nc=2), the class is not overly complex in terms of structure. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests limited responsibility scope. While it has some complexity, the metrics do not indicate sufficient size or complexity to warrant further decomposition."
