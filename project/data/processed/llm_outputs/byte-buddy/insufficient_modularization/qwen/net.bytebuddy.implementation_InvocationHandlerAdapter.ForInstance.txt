{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter.ForInstance",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 84 lines of code (loc=84). While the LOC is somewhat high for a class with no methods, the low number of fields and absence of methods suggests this is likely a data-only class or inner class with minimal complexity. The WMC of 0 indicates no method complexity, and DIT of 1 shows it's at the root of inheritance hierarchy. Without additional methods or complex responsibilities, this does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
