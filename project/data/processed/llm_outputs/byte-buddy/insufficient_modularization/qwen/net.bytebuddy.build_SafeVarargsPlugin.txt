{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 60 lines of code (loc=60), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. The class has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no direct dependencies on other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating a simple structure. While it has 9 dependencies listed, this reflects its interaction requirements rather than internal complexity. The size and complexity metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization."
