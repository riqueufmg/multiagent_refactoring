    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.OfParameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 private fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and only 46 lines of code (loc=46). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With such low size and complexity metrics, and no evidence of high complexity or large size that would warrant further decomposition, this class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
