{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem.StandardCopyOption",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating no method complexity. The class appears to be a simple enum or data holder with minimal responsibilities, which does not indicate insufficient modularization. The low metric values suggest the class is already appropriately decomposed rather than being a candidate for further decomposition."
