{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.privilege.GetSystemPropertyAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with all being private (nopm=2), 1 field (nof=1) with none private (nopf=0), and very low complexity (wmc=2, loc=22). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests minimal coupling. The class is small and simple enough that further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity."
