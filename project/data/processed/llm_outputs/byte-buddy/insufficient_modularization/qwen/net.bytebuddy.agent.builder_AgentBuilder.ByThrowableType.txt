    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ByThrowableType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=41 but this appears to be file-level not class-level), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The class also has minimal dependencies with only 2 fan-out dependencies and no fan-in dependencies. There is insufficient evidence of complexity or size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
