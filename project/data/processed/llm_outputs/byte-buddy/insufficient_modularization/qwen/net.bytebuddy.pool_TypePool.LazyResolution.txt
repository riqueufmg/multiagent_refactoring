    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyResolution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 34 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond its parent TypePool. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its minimal size and complexity."
