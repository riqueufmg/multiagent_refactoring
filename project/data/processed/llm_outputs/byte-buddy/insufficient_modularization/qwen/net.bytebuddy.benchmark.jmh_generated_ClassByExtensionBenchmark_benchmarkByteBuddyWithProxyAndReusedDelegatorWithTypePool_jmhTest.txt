    "justification": "The class has 263 fields which is high, but only 9 methods with WMC of 42, indicating relatively simple method complexity. The class appears to be a generated benchmark test class with high field count due to JMH framework requirements, but the method count and complexity are within reasonable limits for this type of generated testing class."
