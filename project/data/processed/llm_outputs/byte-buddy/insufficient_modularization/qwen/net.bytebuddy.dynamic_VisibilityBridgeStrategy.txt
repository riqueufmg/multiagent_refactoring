{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.VisibilityBridgeStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 48 lines of code (loc=48), no fields (nof=0), and only 1 nested class (nc=1). The low number of methods and fields indicates proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple strategy pattern implementation with minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
