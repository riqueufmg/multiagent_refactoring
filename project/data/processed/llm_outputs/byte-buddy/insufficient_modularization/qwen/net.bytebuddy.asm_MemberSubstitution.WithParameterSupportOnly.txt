    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.WithParameterSupportOnly",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 12 lines of code (loc=12). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While it has dependencies on MethodDescription and AnnotationDescription, the class itself is minimal and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed."
