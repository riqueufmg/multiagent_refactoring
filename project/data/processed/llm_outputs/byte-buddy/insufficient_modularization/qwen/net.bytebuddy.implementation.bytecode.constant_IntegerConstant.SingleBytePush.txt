    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 23 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 complexity metrics (WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0). The class appears to be a simple, well-focused implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
