    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForRedefinition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 53 lines of code (loc=53) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it is already sufficiently decomposed. The lack of methods and low size suggest this class is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
