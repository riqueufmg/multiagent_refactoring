    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Slicing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 fields (nof=10) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 174 lines of code (loc=174). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is likely a data-only class or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The absence of method-level complexity metrics and dependencies indicates insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization."
