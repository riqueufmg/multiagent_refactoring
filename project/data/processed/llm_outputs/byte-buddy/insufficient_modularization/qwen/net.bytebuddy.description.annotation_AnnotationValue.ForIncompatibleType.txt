    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 82 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal method complexity. While it has 3 dependencies, the low internal complexity and small size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data structure or value object that is appropriately decomposed."
