    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.TypeCreation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (3 total, 1 non-public), low lines of code (34), low weighted method count (4), and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low complexity metrics and minimal dependencies indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
