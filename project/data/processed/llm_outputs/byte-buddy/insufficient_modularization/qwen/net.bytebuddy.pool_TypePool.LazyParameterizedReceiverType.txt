    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 4 fields, 0 methods, and 137 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are only 2 dependencies on basic type descriptions. The class appears to be a simple data holder or lazy initialization wrapper with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
