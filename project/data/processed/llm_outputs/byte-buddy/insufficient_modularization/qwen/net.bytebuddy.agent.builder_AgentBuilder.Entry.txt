    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4), 0 methods (nom=0), and 79 lines of code (loc=79). With such a small number of methods and fields, and relatively compact size, there is insufficient complexity to warrant further decomposition. The metrics indicate a simple, focused class that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
