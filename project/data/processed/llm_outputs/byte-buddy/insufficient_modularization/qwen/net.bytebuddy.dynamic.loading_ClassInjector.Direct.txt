    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.Direct",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 230 lines of code (loc=230). While the class has a moderate number of fields and significant LOC, the lack of methods (WMC=0) and absence of complexity metrics (LCOM=-1.0) along with no dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships indicate this may be a data-only class or incomplete implementation rather than a case of insufficient modularization. Without method complexity or behavioral indicators, there's insufficient evidence to determine improper decomposition."
