{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 81 lines of code (loc=81), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or configuration class rather than a complex implementation that needs modularization."
