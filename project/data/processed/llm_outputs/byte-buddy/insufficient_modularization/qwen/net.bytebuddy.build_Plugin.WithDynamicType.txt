    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.WithDynamicType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and only 52 lines of code (loc=52). It has minimal functionality with only 2 fields (nof=2) and no parameters in fields (nopf=0). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
