    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 180 lines of code (loc=180). While the class has a moderate number of fields, the low method count and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a specialized component with focused responsibility, and there is no evidence of excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
