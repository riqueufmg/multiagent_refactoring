    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.AccessBridgeWrapper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 282 lines of code (loc) which is excessively high for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller classes. The class also has 10 fields (nof) and depends on 13 external classes, suggesting high complexity and responsibility that could be better distributed through modularization."
