    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 28 lines of code (loc=28). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof=1) and no parameters. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused implementation class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
