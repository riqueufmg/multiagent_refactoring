{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 473 lines of code (loc) and 15 fields (nof), indicating high size and complexity for a single class. The lack of methods (nom=1) suggests poor decomposition where functionality may be embedded within large, complex methods rather than being properly modularized. The high number of dependencies (10 external classes) indicates the class is trying to handle multiple responsibilities, which supports insufficient modularization."
