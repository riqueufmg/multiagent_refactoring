    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.AccessorBridge",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 82 lines of code (loc=82). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low complexity indicators suggest this is a simple data holder or auxiliary class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The dependencies are related to type descriptions which aligns with the class being part of a type writing scaffold, indicating appropriate cohesion."
