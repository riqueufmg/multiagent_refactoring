{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.HandleInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 2 private methods (nopm=2), 3 fields (nof=3), and 32 lines of code (loc=32). The weighted method count is low (wmc=2) and there are no dependencies on other classes from the same package, indicating proper modularization. The class is small and focused, not warranting further decomposition."
