{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.HasSuperTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 1 field (nof=1), and 47 lines of code (loc=47). The weighted method count (wmc=9) indicates moderate complexity but is not excessive for a class of this size. The lack of class dependencies (dit=0, nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's relatively self-contained. The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion. Given these metrics, the class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
