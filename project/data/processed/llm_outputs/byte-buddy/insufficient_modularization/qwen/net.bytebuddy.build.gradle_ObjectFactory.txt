    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=2, NOM=2, LOC=107) and shows signs of proper decomposition through its dependencies on specialized inner classes (ForLegacyGradle, Dispatcher). The low method count and complexity indicate appropriate modularization rather than insufficient decomposition."
