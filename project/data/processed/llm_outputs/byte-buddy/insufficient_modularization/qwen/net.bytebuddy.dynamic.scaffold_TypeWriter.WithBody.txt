    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 92 lines of code (loc=92). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and simple structure indicates it is already well modularized. No complex dependencies or high complexity metrics suggest insufficient modularization."
