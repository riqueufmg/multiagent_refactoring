    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.AtFixedRate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 40 lines of code (loc=40), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
