    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 114 lines of code (loc=114). The lack of methods and low complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition is not necessary to reduce size or implementation complexity."
