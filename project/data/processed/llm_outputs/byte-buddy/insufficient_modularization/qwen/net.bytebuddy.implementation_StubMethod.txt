    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.StubMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, nopm=5) and 38 lines of code (loc=38), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=5), suggesting low complexity. With only 5 methods, further decomposition would likely not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its current functionality."
