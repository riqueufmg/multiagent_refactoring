    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 18 lines of code (loc=18), and only 256 fields which appears to be generated code rather than manually implemented logic. The low method count and complexity metrics indicate this is likely a simple data class or generated boilerplate code rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The class does not exhibit the characteristics of needing further decomposition."
