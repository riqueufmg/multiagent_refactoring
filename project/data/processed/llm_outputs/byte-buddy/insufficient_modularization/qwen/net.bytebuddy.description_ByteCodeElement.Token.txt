    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 63 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and minimal dependencies on only 2 external classes. The lack of methods and low LOC indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
