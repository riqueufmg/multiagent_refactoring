    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 34 lines of code (loc=34), and minimal metrics across all complexity measures (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0). The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
