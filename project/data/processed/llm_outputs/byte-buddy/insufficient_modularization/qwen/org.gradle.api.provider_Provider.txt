    "class": "org.gradle.api.provider.Provider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0) and 18 lines of code (loc=18), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is also low, suggesting minimal implementation complexity. With such few methods and low complexity, there is no indication that further decomposition would be beneficial."
