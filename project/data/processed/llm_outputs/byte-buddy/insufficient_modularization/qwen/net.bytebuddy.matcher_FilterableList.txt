    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 1 field (nof=1), with a low weighted method count (wmc=3), indicating low complexity. The lines of code (loc=111) include implementation details but the metric-based indicators suggest the class is sufficiently modularized for its current functionality. No high complexity or excessive size indicators present."
