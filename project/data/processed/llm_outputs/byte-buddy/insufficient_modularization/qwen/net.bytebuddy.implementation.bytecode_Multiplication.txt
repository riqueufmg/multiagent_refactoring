    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Multiplication",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 46 lines of code (loc=46), and a simple method complexity (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and low LCOM value (0.667) suggest reasonable cohesion. With only 3 methods and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
