{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.GenericTypeExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 fields (nof=17) and 600 lines of code (loc=600), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0) despite having fields suggests the class may be holding too much state without proper behavioral decomposition. The high line count combined with significant field count indicates the class could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
