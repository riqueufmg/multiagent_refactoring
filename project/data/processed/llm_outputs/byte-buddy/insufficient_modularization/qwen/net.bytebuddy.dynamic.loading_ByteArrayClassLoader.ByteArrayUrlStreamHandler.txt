    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 53 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond a build plugin annotation. The class appears to be a simple, well-contained inner class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
