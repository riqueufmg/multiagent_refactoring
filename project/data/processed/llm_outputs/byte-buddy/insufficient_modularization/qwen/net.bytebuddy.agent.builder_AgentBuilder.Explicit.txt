    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=29 but this appears to be the file level, not class level), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The class also has minimal dependencies with only 1 fan-out dependency. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately simple and focused."
