{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.MavenCoordinate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 5 methods, with 61 lines of code total. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 7 indicating low complexity. With 4 public methods and 4 public fields, the class appears to be a simple data holder or value object that is appropriately decomposed for its purpose. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the absence of dependencies indicates it's a standalone utility class that is sufficiently modularized."
