{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidService.State",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 101 lines of code (loc=101). While the class has some dependencies on 5 external types, the low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well-decomposed. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) suggests this is likely a simple data holder or state container class that does not require further decomposition."
