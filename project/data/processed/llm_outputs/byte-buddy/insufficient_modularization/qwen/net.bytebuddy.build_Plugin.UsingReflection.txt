    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 fields (nof=18) and 488 lines of code (loc=488), indicating high size and complexity that suggests insufficient modularization. The lack of methods (nom=0) and high line count suggest this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
