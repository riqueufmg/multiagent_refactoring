    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.HasSuperClassMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (3 total, 2 public), low lines of code (34), low weighted method count (6), and no class dependencies. The metrics indicate a well-focused, simple class with single responsibility. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
