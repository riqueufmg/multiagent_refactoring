{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.LongConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 3 public), low lines of code (77), low weighted method count (6), and reasonable lack of cohesion (0.75). While some decomposition could be possible, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant classification as Insufficient Modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
