    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 28 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 method parameters. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and the LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused implementation class with minimal responsibilities that does not warrant further decomposition."
