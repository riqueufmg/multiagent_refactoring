    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForRegularInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 47 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and no inheritance (dit=0). The lack of methods and low LOC suggest it is already well-decomposed or represents a simple data structure rather than a complex class that needs further modularization."
