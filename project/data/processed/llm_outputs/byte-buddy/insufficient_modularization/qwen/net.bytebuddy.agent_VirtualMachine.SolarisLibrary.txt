    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.SolarisLibrary",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields and 0 methods, with a low LOC of 77. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) indicate this is a simple data structure or interface rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its minimal functionality."
