    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=147 but this appears to be the file level, not class level), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and complexity indicates minimal implementation that does not warrant further decomposition. No signs of high complexity or large size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
