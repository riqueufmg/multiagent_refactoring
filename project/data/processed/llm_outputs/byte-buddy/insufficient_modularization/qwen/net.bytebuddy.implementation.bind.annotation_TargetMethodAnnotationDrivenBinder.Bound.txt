    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder.Bound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4), 0 methods (nom=0), and 58 lines of code (loc=58). With such a small number of fields and no methods, the class does not exhibit complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The low WMC (0) and absence of any methods indicate minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
