    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentList.ForLoadedRecordComponents",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 35 lines of code (loc=35). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof=1, nopf=0) and no class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The LCOM value of -1.0 indicates good cohesion. Given its minimal size and complexity, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
