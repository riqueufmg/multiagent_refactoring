    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.AnnotationReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 30 fields (nof=30) and 847 lines of code (loc=847), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential incomplete decomposition where functionality may be embedded within field declarations or inline code rather than properly modularized into separate methods. The high number of fields combined with substantial LOC suggests this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
