    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (209 loc), low complexity (WMC=2), few methods (2 total, 0 public), and manageable number of fields (5 total, 1 public). While it has 51 nested classes which indicates some complexity, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class itself maintains low complexity and reasonable size."
