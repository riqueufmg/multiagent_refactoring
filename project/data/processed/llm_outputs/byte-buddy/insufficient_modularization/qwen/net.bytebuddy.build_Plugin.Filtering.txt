    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 111 lines of code (loc=111). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low complexity indicates it is already well-decomposed. No significant modularization issues are present given the limited scope and complexity of this class."
