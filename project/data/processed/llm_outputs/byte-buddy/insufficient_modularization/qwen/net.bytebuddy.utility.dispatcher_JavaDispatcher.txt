```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 32 fields (nof=32), 6 methods (nom=6) with a total of 1180 lines of code (loc=1180) and weighted method count of 51 (wmc=51). The high number of fields and lines of code, combined with a low method count, indicates insufficient decomposition. The class contains multiple nested classes (Resolver, ForDefaultValue, NoOp, Dispatcher, OfPrimitiveArray, DynamicClassLoader, CreationAction) which suggests it is handling multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
