    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 33 lines of code (loc). It also has minimal dependencies with only 1 fanout to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. The low size and complexity metrics indicate sufficient modularization has already been achieved."
