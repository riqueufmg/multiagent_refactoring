    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 44 lines of code (loc=44). It has minimal fields (nof=3) and no parameters (nopf=0). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
