    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor.Available",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 56 lines of code (loc=56). It has minimal fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
