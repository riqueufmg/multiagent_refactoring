{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Delegate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 30 lines of code, zero methods (nom=0), zero fields (nof=0), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. While it has a dependency on TypeList, this single dependency does not indicate insufficient modularization given the class's minimal size and complexity."
