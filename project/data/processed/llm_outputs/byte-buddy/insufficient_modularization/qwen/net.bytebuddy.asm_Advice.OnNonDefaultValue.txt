{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OnNonDefaultValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With such minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly decomposed."
