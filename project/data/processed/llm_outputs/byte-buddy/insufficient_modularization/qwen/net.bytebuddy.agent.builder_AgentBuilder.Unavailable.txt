{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Unavailable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 25 lines of code (loc=25). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With such low size and complexity metrics, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly simplified and does not require further decomposition."
