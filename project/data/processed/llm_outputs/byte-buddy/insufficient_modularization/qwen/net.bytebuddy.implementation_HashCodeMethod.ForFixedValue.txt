    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.ForFixedValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 1 field (nof=1), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and only 22 lines of code (loc=22). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0), indicating no method complexity. With minimal size and complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed."
