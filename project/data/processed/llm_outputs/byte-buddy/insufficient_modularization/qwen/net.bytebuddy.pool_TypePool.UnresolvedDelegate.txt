    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 32 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0). The class appears to be a simple delegate with minimal responsibilities and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed."
