    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 48 lines of code (loc=48), and no dependencies on other classes except for annotation purposes. The lack of methods (nopm=0, wmc=0) indicates it's likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
