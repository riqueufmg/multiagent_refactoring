{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 92 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and simple method structure (nopm=0) indicates minimal complexity. While the class could potentially be decomposed, the current size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it maintains a focused responsibility with low cyclomatic complexity."
