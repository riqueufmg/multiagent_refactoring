    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_jmhType_B1",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 18 lines of code and 256 fields which suggests it's a data-only class likely generated for benchmarking purposes. While the high number of fields (256) might seem concerning, the class has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and appears to be a simple data structure or configuration class. The low complexity (wmc=0) and single class hierarchy level (dit=1) indicate it's not overly complex despite the large number of fields. This appears to be a legitimate use case for a data-heavy but simple class rather than insufficient modularization."
