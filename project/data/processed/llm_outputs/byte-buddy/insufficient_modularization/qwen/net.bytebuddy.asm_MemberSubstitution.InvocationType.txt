{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.InvocationType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 39 lines of code (loc=39). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). This indicates a simple, well-decomposed class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
