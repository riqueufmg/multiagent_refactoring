{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.TokenizedGenericType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 fields (nof=19) and 264 lines of code (loc=264), indicating high size and complexity. With no methods (nom=0) and no public methods (nopm=0), this suggests the class may be a data-only class that could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and improve modularity. The high number of fields relative to methods indicates insufficient modularization where functionality could be better distributed."
