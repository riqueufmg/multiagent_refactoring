    "justification": "Class has only 3 fields and 0 methods, with 87 lines of code. While the LOC count is relatively high for the number of methods, the class lacks sufficient complexity (WMC=0, NOM=0) to indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
