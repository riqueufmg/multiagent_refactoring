    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForInstrumentedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 25 lines of code (loc=25) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it is already well-decomposed. The lack of methods and low size suggest this class does not suffer from insufficient modularization as it has been appropriately broken down into small, focused components."
