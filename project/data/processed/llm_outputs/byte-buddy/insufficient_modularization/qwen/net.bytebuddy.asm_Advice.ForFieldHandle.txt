{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForFieldHandle",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 289 lines of code (loc) and 12 fields (nof), but no methods (nom=0), indicating incomplete decomposition. The high line count combined with lack of method implementation suggests the class could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and improve organization."
