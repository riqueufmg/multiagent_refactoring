    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.Initializable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 10 lines of code (loc=10). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods or fields to decompose further, the class is already at a minimal level of modularization appropriate for its size and complexity."
