    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveNarrowingDelegate.NarrowingStackManipulation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 31 lines of code (loc=31), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or minimal implementation class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
