    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.RedefinitionDynamicTypeBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 62 lines of code (loc=62), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 public method (nopm=1) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class appears to have a focused responsibility. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and composition complexity (nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) further supports that this class is sufficiently modularized."
