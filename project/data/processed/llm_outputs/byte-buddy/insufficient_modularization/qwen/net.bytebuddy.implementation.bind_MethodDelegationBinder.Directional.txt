    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 27 lines of code (loc). It has minimal functionality with only 1 field (nof) and no dependencies, indicating it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
