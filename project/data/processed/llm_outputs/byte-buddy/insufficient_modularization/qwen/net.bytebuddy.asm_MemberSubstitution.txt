{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (292), a high number of methods (16), and a high lines of code (6597), indicating it is large and potentially complex. The lack of public fields (0) and the relatively low number of public methods (14 out of 16) suggest encapsulation, but the overall size and complexity imply that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
