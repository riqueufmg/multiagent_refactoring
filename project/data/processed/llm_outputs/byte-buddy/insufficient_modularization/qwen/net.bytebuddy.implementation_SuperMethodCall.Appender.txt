    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.SuperMethodCall.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 59 lines of code (loc=59). The low number of methods and fields, combined with the relatively small size, does not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its current functionality."
