{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForParameterizedType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 fields (nof=18) and 241 lines of code (loc=241), indicating high size and complexity. With no methods (nom=0) but many fields, this suggests the class may be holding too much data responsibility without proper decomposition. The high field count relative to methods indicates potential insufficient modularization where related data and functionality could be better distributed across smaller, more focused classes."
