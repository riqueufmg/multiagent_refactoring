{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.WithImplicitType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 16 lines of code (loc), zero methods (nom), zero fields (nof), and zero weighted method count (wmc). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. While the class has dependencies on 4 external classes, this represents typical usage patterns rather than insufficient modularization since the class itself remains simple and focused."
