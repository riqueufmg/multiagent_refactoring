    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.MethodExceptionTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 public methods (nopm=2), and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lines of code (loc=26) are minimal, and there are no class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The class appears to be well-focused with a single responsibility and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
