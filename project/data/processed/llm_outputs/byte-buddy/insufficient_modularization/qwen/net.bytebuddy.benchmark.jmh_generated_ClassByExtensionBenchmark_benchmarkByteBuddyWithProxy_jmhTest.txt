    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a manageable size with 276 lines of code and 9 methods. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) is 42, which is reasonable for a benchmark test class. With 263 fields, while high, this is typical for generated JMH benchmark classes that contain numerous state and configuration fields. The low number of public methods (8) and zero complexity metrics (NC, DIT, LCOM as 0.0) suggest this is a specialized generated test class rather than a complex business logic class that requires further decomposition."
