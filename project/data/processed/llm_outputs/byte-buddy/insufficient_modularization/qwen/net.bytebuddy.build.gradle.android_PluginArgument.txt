    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.PluginArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods (nom=7) and 3 fields (nof=3), with 70 lines of code (loc=70). The weighted method count (wmc=7) equals the number of methods, indicating simple method complexity. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion. The class size and complexity metrics are within reasonable limits for a single cohesive unit, and there's no evidence of incomplete decomposition requiring further modularization."
