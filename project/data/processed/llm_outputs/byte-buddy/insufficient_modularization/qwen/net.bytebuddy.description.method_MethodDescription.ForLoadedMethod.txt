    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription.ForLoadedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 137 lines of code which is not excessively large, but more importantly, the metrics show 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0) which suggests incomplete metric data. Without reliable method count and complexity metrics, and given the relatively moderate LOC count, there is insufficient evidence to determine insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a nested class (ForLoadedMethod) which may have specialized responsibilities."
