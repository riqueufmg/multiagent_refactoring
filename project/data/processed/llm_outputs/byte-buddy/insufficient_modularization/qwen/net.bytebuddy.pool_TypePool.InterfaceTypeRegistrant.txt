    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). It appears to be a simple data holder or marker interface with no behavioral complexity that would require further decomposition. The lack of methods and minimal size indicates sufficient modularization for its current purpose."
