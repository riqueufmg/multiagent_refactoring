    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 1 field (nof=1), and low complexity (wmc=3, loc=26). The LCOM value is 0.0 indicating good cohesion. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized with a focused responsibility as suggested by its name and minimal method count."
