    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is likely an empty or minimal class structure. With only 43 lines of code (loc=43) and no complexity metrics indicating high complexity (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0), there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be properly decomposed or is a simple data holder."
