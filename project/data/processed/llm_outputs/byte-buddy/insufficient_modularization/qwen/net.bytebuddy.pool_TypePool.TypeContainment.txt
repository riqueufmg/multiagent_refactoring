    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.TypeContainment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 164 lines of code (loc=164). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well-decomposed. The class does not exhibit high complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
