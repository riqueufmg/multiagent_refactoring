    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 52 lines of code (loc=52). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The class does not exhibit high complexity, large size, or excessive responsibilities that would indicate insufficient modularization."
