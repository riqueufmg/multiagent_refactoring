    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForCreation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 347 lines of code (loc) and 14 fields (nof), indicating a large and complex implementation that could benefit from further decomposition. The high number of dependencies (15) suggests multiple responsibilities and cross-cutting concerns that should be separated into smaller, more focused modules. The class appears to handle multiple aspects of type creation including module descriptions, auxiliary types, ASM visitor wrappers, and various bytecode manipulation components, which indicates insufficient modularization as these responsibilities could be decomposed into separate cohesive units."
