    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayFactory.ArrayCreator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields (nof=4), no methods (nom=0), and low lines of code (loc=107). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
