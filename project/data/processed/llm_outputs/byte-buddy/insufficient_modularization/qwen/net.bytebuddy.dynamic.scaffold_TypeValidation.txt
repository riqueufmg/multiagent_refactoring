    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 36 lines of code (loc=36), with a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The class implements a single responsibility with minimal complexity and size, indicating sufficient modularization. No further decomposition would provide meaningful benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
