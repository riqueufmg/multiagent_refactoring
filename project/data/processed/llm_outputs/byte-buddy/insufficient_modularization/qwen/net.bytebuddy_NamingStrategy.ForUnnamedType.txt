    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 14 lines of code (loc), no methods (nom=0, nof=0), and no dependencies. The metrics indicate minimal implementation complexity and size, suggesting it is already sufficiently decomposed. No further decomposition would provide meaningful reduction in complexity or size."
