{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForElementMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 69 lines of code (loc=69). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on 4 other classes, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The WMC of 0 indicates no method complexity, and the negative LCOM value suggests good cohesion among the existing fields."
