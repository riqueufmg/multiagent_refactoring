    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.CompoundIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 57 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships. The class appears to be a simple data holder or iterator implementation that is already sufficiently decomposed given its minimal functionality."
