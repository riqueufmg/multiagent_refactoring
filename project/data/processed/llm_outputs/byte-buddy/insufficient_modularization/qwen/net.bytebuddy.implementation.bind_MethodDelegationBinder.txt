    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 fields (nof=28) and 777 lines of code (loc=777), indicating high size and complexity. It also declares multiple nested classes such as Record, Resolution, AmbiguityResolver, Default, MethodBinding, MethodInvoker, BindingResolver, and Illegal, suggesting insufficient decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=1) with high field count indicates potential for further modularization to reduce complexity."
