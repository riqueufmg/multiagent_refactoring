    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.Unavailable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 28 lines of code (loc=28). It also has minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no fields (nof=1, nc=0). This indicates a simple, well-decomposed class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
