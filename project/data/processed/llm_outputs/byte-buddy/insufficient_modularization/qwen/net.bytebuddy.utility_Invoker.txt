    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.Invoker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 25 lines of code (loc=25), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 class attribute (nc=1) and no fields or parameters, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
