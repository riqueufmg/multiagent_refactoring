    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0, nof=2) and reasonable size (loc=170). While it has some dependencies on build plugins, there is insufficient evidence of high complexity or large size that would indicate insufficient modularization without knowledge of the actual implementation complexity and responsibilities."
