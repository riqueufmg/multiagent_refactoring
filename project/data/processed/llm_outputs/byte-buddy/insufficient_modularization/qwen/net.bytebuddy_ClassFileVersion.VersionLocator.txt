    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion.VersionLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 117 lines of code (loc=117). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and simple structure do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
