    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.FieldNameExtractor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 80 lines of code (loc). With only 1 field (nof) and no method parameters (nopf), the class is already sufficiently modularized. The negative LCOM value (-1.0) indicates good cohesion, and the absence of fan-in and fan-out dependencies suggests minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
