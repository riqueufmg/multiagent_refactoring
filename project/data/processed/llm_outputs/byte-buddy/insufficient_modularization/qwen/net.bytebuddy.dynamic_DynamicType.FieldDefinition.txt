    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.FieldDefinition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3). The lines of code (loc=223) are relatively high but this is likely due to the inner class being part of a larger file structure. With minimal methods and low structural complexity, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class does not exhibit high complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
