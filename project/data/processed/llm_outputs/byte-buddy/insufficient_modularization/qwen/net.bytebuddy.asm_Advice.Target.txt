{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Target",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 566 lines of code (loc) and 17 fields (nof), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom: 0) suggests poor decomposition where functionality may be embedded within large field initializations or nested structures rather than being properly modularized. High line count combined with significant field count and zero methods indicates insufficient modularization where the class has not been properly decomposed into smaller, more manageable components."
