{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a very high number of fields (403), methods (24), and lines of code (11101), indicating it is highly complex and likely undertakes too many responsibilities. The high WMC (37) further supports the complexity. Although LCOM is low (0.333), suggesting good cohesion, the sheer size and complexity of the class indicate that it could benefit from further decomposition to improve modularity and reduce implementation complexity."
