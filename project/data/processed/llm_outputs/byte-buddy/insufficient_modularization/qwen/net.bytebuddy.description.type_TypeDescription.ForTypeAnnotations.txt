    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForTypeAnnotations",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 89 lines of code (loc=89). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0, nopf=0) and low field count indicate it is already well-decomposed. The negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) suggests good cohesion, and zero fan-in and fan-out indicate minimal dependencies. This class appears to be a simple data structure rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
