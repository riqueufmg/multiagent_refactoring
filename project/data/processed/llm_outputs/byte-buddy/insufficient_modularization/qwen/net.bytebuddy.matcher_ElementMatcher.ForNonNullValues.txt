    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher.ForNonNullValues",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 18 lines of code (loc=18). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While it's a nested class, its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization - it appears to be appropriately decomposed for its simple functionality."
