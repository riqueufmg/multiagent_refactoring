{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 12 methods (nom=12) and 641 lines of code (loc=641), along with 14 method dependencies and 20 class dependencies. The high number of methods and lines of code, combined with significant dependencies, indicates the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
