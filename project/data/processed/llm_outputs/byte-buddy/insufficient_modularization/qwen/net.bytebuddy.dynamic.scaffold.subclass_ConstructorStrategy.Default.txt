{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.ConstructorStrategy.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 0 public methods (nopm=0). With very few members and no methods, the class is already minimally decomposed. The LOC is 158 but this is likely due to complex field declarations or nested structures rather than complex implementation logic. WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT is 1 showing no inheritance hierarchy complexity. The low member count and absence of methods indicate sufficient modularization."
