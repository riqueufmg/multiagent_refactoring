    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForRawType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 34 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low LOC indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
