    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 25 lines of code and 0 weighted method count. It appears to be a small abstract base class that doesn't exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The metrics suggest it's already well-decomposed rather than being a large, complex class that needs further decomposition."
