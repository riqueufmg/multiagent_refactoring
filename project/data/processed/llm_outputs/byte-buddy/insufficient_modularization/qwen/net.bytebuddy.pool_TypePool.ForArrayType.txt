    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 0 methods, 29 lines of code, and 0 weighted method count. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, well-encapsulated component with no signs of insufficient modularization."
