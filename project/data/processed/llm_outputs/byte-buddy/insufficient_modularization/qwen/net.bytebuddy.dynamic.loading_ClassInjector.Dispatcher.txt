    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 134 lines of code (loc=134). While the LOC is relatively high for a class with only 2 fields and no methods, the low number of fields and methods indicates minimal complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. Without methods implementing complex logic, there is insufficient evidence of implementation complexity that would warrant further modularization."
