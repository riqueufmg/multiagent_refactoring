{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.TypeCasting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 2 private methods (nopm=2), 34 lines of code (loc=34), and a low weighted method count (wmc=4). The LCOM value of 0.6666666666666666 indicates reasonable cohesion. The class has minimal complexity and size, with only 1 field (nof=1) and no package-level dependencies (nopf=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics suggest the class is sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
