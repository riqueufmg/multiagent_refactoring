    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=46 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). With no methods or significant functionality, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already minimally implemented."
