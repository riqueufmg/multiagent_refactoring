    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription.TypeInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 70 lines of code (loc). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof) and 0 public fields (nopf). The lack of methods and low complexity indicates proper modularization rather than insufficient decomposition."
