    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 28 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and no dependencies on other classes. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly simplified and decomposed."
