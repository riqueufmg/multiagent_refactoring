{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.SuperMethodCall.WithoutReturn",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 19 lines of code (loc=19). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, lightweight component that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
