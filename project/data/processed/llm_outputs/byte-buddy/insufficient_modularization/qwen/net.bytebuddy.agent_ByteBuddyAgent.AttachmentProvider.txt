{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.AttachmentProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 fields (nof=11) and 378 lines of code (loc=378), indicating high size and complexity for a single class. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests poor decomposition where functionality may be embedded within field definitions or nested classes rather than properly modularized methods. High field count combined with substantial LOC suggests insufficient modularization where the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused components."
