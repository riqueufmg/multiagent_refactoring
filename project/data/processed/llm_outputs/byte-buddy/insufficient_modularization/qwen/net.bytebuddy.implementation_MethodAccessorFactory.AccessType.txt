    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 28 lines of code (loc=28), and minimal dependencies on only 1 external class. The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
