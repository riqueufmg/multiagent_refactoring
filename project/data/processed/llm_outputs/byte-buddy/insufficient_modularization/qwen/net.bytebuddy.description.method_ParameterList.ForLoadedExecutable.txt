    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList.ForLoadedExecutable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 10 fields (nof=10) and 224 lines of code (loc=224), indicating high complexity and insufficient decomposition. The class embeds multiple responsibilities including parameter handling for loaded executables, dispatcher integration, and access controller functionality. The presence of multiple dependencies (JavaDispatcher, AccessControllerPlugin) suggests it orchestrates various concerns rather than focusing on a single responsibility, violating the principle of sufficient modularization."
