    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_baseline_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (9 total, 8 public), low weighted method count (42), and reasonable lines of code (276). While the class has many fields (263), this is typical for JMH-generated benchmark test classes which often contain numerous state fields for benchmark execution. The low complexity metrics (WMC=42, LCOM=0.0) and absence of inheritance (DIT=0) suggest this is a simple, cohesive class that does not require further decomposition."
