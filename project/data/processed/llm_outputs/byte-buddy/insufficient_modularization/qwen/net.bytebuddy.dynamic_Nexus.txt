    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Nexus",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (108 LOC, 9 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=12). The method-to-field ratio (9 methods for 6 fields) suggests appropriate functionality distribution. LCOM=0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class. The number of public methods (6) is proportional to total methods (9), and there are no external dependencies or coupling metrics indicating modularity issues."
