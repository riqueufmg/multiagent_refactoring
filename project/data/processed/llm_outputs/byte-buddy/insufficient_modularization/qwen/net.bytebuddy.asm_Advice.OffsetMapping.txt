    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OffsetMapping",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 165 fields and 3434 lines of code, indicating excessive size and complexity. The high number of dependencies (20 external types) suggests it handles too many responsibilities. With 6 public fields and no methods, it appears to be a data-heavy class that lacks proper decomposition into smaller, focused components, violating the principle of Insufficient Modularization."
