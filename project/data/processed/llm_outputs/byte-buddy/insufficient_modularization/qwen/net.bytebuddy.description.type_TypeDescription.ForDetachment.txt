    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 33 lines of code (loc), 1 field (nof), 0 methods (nom), and a Weighted Methods per Class of 0 (wmc). The lack of methods and low LOC indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or utility class with no signs of insufficient modularization."
