    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 32 lines of code (loc=32), and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of fields (nof=2) and lack of complex metrics (lcom=-1.0, nc=0) indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
