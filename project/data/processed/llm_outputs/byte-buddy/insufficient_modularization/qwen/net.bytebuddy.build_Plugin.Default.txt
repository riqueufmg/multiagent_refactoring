    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 23 fields (nof=23) and 568 lines of code (loc=568), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The class likely contains too much responsibility and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
