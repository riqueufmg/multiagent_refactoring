    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.ClassByImplementationBenchmark",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 32 methods (nom), 66 weighted methods per class (wmc), 370 lines of code (loc), and high LCOM value of 0.6875. The class implements 22 features (nof) with 10 public features (nopf), suggesting it has not been completely decomposed. The high method count and complexity metrics indicate the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
