    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low LOC count (35). WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. The class appears to be a simple empty implementation pattern class with minimal responsibilities. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly decomposed and simple."
