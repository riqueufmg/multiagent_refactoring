{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension.ForMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 167 lines of code (loc) which is excessively high for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality. The class has 4 fields (nof) but no methods (nom=0), suggesting it may be holding too much state or responsibility. The lack of methods despite significant lines of code suggests potential insufficient modularization where functionality could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The WMC of 0 and LCOM of -1.0 further suggest poor internal structure that could benefit from decomposition."
