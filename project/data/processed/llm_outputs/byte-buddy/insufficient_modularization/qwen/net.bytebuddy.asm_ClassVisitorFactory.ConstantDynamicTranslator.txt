    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.ConstantDynamicTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 fields (nof=5), 0 methods (nom=0), and 81 lines of code (loc=81). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0) indicating minimal method complexity. With no methods present, there is no implementation complexity to decompose further, and the class size is relatively small, suggesting sufficient modularization has already been achieved."
