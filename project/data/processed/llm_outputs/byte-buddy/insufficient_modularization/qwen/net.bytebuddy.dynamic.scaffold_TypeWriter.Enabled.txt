    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Enabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 33 lines of code (loc=33), and no dependencies or coupling metrics indicating complexity. The low number of fields (nof=2) and lack of structural complexity (lcom=-1.0, nc=0, dit=0) suggest this is a simple, well-modularized class that does not require further decomposition."
