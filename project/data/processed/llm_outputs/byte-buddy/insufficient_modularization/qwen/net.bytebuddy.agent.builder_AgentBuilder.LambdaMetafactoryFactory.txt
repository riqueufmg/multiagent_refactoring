    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaMetafactoryFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 526 lines of code (loc) which indicates high size, and contains 4 fields (nof) but no methods (nom), suggesting incomplete decomposition where functionality may be embedded within field definitions or nested structures rather than properly modularized methods. The high line count with minimal method count suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce implementation complexity."
