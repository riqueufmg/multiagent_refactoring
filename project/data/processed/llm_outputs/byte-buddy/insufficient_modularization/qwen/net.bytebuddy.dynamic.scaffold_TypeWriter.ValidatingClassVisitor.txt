    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ValidatingClassVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 1255 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating high implementation complexity. The class has 12 fields (nof) but no methods (nom=0), suggesting incomplete decomposition where functionality may be embedded in nested classes or anonymous inner classes rather than being properly modularized. The high line count combined with the field-to-method ratio suggests the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
