{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Illegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=28 but this appears to be file-level LOC not class-level), and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0). The low number of fields (nof=1) and lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate this is a simple data class or exception class that is appropriately decomposed. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is minimal and focused."
