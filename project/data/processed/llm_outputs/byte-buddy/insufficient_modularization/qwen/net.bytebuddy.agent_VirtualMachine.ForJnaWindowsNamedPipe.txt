    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.ForJnaWindowsNamedPipe",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 339 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it has not been completely decomposed. It contains 10 fields (nof) and 1 private field (nopf), suggesting complex state management that could be better modularized. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) combined with high line count suggests the class likely contains long, complex implementations that should be broken down into smaller, more focused methods and potentially separate classes. The high line count relative to the minimal method count indicates insufficient decomposition of functionality."
