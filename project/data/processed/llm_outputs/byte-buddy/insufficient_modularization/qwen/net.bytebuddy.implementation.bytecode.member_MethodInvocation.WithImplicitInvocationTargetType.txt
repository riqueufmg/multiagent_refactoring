    "justification": "The class has 32 lines of code which is relatively small, DIT of 1 indicates no inheritance hierarchy to consider, and all other complexity metrics (WMC, NOF, NOM, etc.) are 0 or minimal, suggesting the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
