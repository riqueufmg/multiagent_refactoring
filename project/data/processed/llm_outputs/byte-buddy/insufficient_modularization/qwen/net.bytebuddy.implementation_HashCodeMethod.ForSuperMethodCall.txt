    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.ForSuperMethodCall",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class depends on StackManipulation, its size and complexity are already minimal, suggesting it has been sufficiently decomposed rather than suffering from Insufficient Modularization."
