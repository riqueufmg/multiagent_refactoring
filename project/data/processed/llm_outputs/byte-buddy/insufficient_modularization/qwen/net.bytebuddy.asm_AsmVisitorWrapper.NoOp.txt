    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is already fully decomposed. With a WMC of 0 and DIT of 1, the class shows minimal complexity and no inheritance hierarchy issues. The low LOC (25) is appropriate for a minimal class structure, and there are no signs of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be properly decomposed with no complexity to reduce."
