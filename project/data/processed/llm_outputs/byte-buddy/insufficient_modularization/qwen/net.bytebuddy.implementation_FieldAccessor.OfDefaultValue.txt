    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is likely an empty or placeholder class. With no complexity metrics (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0) and minimal size (loc=45), there is insufficient implementation complexity or size to warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be properly modularized given its minimal nature."
