    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 51 lines of code (loc). It also has minimal dependencies with only 1 fan-out dependency. The low metric values indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
