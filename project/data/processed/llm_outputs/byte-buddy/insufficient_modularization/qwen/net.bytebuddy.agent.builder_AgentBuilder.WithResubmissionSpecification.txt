    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.WithResubmissionSpecification",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 5 lines of code (loc=5). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Since the class is already minimal in terms of size and complexity, there is no indication of insufficient modularization."
