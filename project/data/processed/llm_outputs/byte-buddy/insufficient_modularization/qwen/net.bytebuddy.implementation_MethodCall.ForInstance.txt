    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForInstance",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 69 lines of code (loc=69). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on 6 other classes, the low number of fields and methods suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
