{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WriterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 36 lines of code (loc=36). The low number of fields and methods, combined with the relatively small size (36 LOC), indicates that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple factory class with minimal complexity that does not require further decomposition."
