```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 8 public methods (nopm=8), 111 lines of code (loc=111), and a weighted method count of 21 (wmc=21). While the class has a moderate number of methods and lines of code, the relatively low WMC and manageable method count suggest it is reasonably well-modularized. The LCOM value of 0.444 indicates good cohesion among the methods. The class appears to have a single, well-defined responsibility related to stack size management in bytecode manipulation."
