    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6), 0 methods (nom=0), and 79 lines of code (loc=79). With no methods and relatively few fields, the class is already minimally decomposed. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
