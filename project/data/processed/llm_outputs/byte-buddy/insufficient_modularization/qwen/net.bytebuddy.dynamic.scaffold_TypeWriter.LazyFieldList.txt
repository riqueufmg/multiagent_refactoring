    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 1 field (nof=1), and 28 lines of code. The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or placeholder with no substantial functionality to decompose."
