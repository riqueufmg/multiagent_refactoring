    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.IncrementalResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 40 lines of code, which is relatively small. With 0 fields (nof=0) and only 1 class dependency, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low complexity metrics indicate proper modularization."
