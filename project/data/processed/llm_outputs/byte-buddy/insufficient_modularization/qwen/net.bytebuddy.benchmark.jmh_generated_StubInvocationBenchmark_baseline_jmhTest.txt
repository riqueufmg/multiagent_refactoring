    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_baseline_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (9 total, 8 public), low complexity (WMC=42), and reasonable size (276 LOC). While it has many fields (263), these are likely generated benchmark fields required for JMH testing framework functionality. The class appears to be a generated benchmark test class with a single responsibility pattern, showing appropriate modularization for its purpose."
