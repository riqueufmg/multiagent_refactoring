    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 84 lines of code (loc=84). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and simple structure indicated by dit=1 and no inheritance complexity suggests this is a lightweight class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a specialized inner class with focused responsibility."
