    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a manageable size with 276 lines of code and 9 methods. The WMC of 42 indicates moderate complexity. With only 263 fields, the class is not excessively large. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class. The low number of methods and fields, combined with moderate complexity metrics, indicate that further decomposition would not significantly improve the design."
