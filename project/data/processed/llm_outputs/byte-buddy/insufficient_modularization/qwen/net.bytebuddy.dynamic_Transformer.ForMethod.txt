    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.ForMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 fields (nof=8), 0 methods (nom=0), and 268 lines of code (loc=268). While the LOC is relatively high for a class with no methods, the low number of fields and methods suggests it may be a data class or simple structure rather than a complex class needing decomposition. The WMC of 0 indicates no method complexity, and with DIT=1 it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy. Without other classes to compare against for LCOM calculation (lcom=-1.0), and with zero fan-in and fan-out dependencies, there's insufficient evidence of complex internal structure that would benefit from further modularization."
