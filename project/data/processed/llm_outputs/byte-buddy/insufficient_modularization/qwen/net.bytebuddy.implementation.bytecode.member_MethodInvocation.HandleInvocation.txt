    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 34 lines of code (loc=34). The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. The class appears to be a simple data holder or value object with minimal complexity, not warranting further decomposition."
