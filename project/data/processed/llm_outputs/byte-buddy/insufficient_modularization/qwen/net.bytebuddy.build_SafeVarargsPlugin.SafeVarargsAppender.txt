    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin.SafeVarargsAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 28 lines of code (loc=28). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, DIT is 1 showing no deep inheritance, and there are no dependencies to other classes beyond the parent class. The class appears to be a simple, minimal implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed."
