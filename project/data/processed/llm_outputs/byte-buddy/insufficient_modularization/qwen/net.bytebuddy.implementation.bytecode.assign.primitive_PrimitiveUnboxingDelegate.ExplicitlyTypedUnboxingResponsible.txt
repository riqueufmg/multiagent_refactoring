    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 45 lines of code (loc). It also has minimal dependencies with only 3 fan-out connections. The low metric values indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
