{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.FieldAccess.FieldPutInstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. There are no dependencies on other classes beyond the HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin annotation. Given the extremely low size and complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed and minimal in nature."
