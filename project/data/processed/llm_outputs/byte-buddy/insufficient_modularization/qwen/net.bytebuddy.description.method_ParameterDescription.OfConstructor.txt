    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription.OfConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low lines of code (loc=42). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class has some dependencies (3 fanout), its size and complexity are already minimal, suggesting it is sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
