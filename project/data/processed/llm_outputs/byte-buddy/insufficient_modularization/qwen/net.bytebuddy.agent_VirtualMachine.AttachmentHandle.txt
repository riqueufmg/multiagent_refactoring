    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.AttachmentHandle",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 46 lines of code (loc=46), and no complexity metrics indicating high complexity (wmc=0, nc=0). The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation that does not exhibit characteristics of insufficient modularization."
