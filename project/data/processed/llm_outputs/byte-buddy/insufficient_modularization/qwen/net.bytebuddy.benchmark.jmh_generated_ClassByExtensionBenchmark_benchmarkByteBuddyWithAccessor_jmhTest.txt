    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithAccessor_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a manageable size with 276 lines of code and 9 methods. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) is 42, which is moderate. With 263 fields, the class is data-heavy but this is typical for JMH-generated benchmark test classes that store various state and configuration data. The low method count relative to fields (9 methods for 263 fields) and zero complexity metrics (LCOM=0.0, DIT=0, NC=0) suggest this is a specialized generated class rather than a poorly modularized business logic class."
