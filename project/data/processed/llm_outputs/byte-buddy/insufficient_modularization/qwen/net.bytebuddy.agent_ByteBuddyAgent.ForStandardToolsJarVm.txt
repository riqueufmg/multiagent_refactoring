    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.ForStandardToolsJarVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 40 lines of code (loc=40), and no dependencies. The lack of methods (nopm=0, nopf=0, wmc=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
