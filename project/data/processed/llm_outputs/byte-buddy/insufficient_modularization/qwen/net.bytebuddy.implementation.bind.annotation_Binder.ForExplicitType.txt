    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.ForExplicitType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 25 lines of code (loc), 1 field (nof), 0 methods (nom), and 0 weighted method count (wmc). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex implementation that needs modularization."
