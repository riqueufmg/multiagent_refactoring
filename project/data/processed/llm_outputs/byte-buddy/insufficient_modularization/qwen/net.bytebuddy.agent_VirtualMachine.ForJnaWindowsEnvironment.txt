{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.ForJnaWindowsEnvironment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 306 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it contains too much implementation logic. It also has 9 fields (nof) and 3 public fields (nopf), suggesting it manages too much data responsibility. The class lacks any methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0), which combined with the high line count suggests implementation complexity that could be reduced through decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high number of fields and large size indicate insufficient modularization as the class has not been completely decomposed."
