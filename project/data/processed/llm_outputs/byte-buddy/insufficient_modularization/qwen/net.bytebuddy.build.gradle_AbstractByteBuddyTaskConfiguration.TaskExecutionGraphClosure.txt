    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 34 lines of code (loc=34). With no methods and minimal functionality, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already at a minimal decomposition state."
