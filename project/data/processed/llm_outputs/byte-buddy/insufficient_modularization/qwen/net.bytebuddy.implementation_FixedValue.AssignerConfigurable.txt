    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.AssignerConfigurable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 12 lines of code (loc=12). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, DIT is 1 showing no inheritance depth, and there are no dependencies to other classes beyond the Assigner import. The class appears to be a simple configuration class or interface implementation with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
