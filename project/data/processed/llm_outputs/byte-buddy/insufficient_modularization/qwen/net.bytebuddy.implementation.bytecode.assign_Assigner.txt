    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 95 lines of code which is reasonable for a single responsibility class, and only 3 fields. The low number of methods and fields indicates proper modularization rather than insufficient decomposition."
