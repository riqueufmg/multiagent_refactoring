{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.IncrementalResolver.ForChangedFiles",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 25 lines of code (loc=25). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) is 1, showing no deep inheritance. While the class may be nested (indicated by the dot in the name), its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, well-contained component."
