```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyTypeDescription",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 0 public methods (nopm=0). The lines of code (loc=31) are relatively low, and the weighted method count (wmc=0) indicates no method complexity. The lack of methods and low field count suggest the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
