    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 22 lines of code (loc), zero methods (nom), zero fields (nof), and zero weighted method count (wmc). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or marker class with no substantial functionality to decompose."
