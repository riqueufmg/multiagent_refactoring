{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 514 lines of code (loc) and only 2 methods (nom), indicating a high concentration of functionality within a small number of methods. The class also has a WMC of 2, which is low, but this is likely due to the methods being complex rather than simple. The class has 10 fields (nof) and contains multiple nested classes (Factory, Default, JdkClassWriter, etc.) as dependencies, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The high loc combined with low method count and multiple nested class dependencies indicates the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
