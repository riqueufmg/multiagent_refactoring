    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.TypeAttributeAppender.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=25 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The class also has minimal dependencies with only 2 fan-in and 0 fan-out connections. With such low complexity and minimal responsibilities, further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in reducing size or implementation complexity."
