    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForSerializedValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 94 lines of code (loc=94). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low complexity indicates it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class with minimal responsibilities."
