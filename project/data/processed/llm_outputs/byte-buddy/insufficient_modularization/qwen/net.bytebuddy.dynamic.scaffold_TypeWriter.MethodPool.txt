{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.MethodPool",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 29 fields (nof=29) and 925 lines of code (loc=925), indicating high complexity and insufficient modularization. The large number of dependencies (15 external dependencies) suggests that this class is handling too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The absence of methods (nom=0) despite having fields suggests potential design issues where functionality may be scattered or improperly encapsulated."
