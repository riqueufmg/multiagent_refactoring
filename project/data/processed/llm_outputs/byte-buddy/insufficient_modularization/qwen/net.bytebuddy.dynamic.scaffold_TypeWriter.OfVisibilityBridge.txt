    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.OfVisibilityBridge",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 191 lines of code (loc=191). While the class has a moderate number of fields and dependencies (11 external dependencies), the lack of methods suggests it may be a data-only class or configuration holder. The WMC of 0 indicates no method complexity, and the DIT of 1 shows it's not deeply inherited. Without methods to analyze complexity or cohesion patterns, and given the class appears to be a specialized inner class (OfVisibilityBridge), there's insufficient evidence to determine insufficient modularization."
