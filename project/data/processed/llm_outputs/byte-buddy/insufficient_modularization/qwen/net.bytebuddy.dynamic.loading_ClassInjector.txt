{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (61 nof), a large size in terms of lines of code (2245 loc), and contains multiple nested classes and interfaces as dependencies (e.g., ClassInjector.System, ClassInjector.Dispatcher, ClassInjector.Default, etc.). These factors indicate that the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and complexity."
