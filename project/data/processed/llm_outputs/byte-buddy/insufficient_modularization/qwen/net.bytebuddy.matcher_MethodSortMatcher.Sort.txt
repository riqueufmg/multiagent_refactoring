    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.MethodSortMatcher.Sort",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 80 lines of code (loc=80). While the LOC is moderately high for a class with no methods, the low number of fields and methods suggests it may be an enum or data class rather than a complex class requiring decomposition. Without methods to analyze complexity or identify distinct responsibilities, there's insufficient evidence to determine that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
