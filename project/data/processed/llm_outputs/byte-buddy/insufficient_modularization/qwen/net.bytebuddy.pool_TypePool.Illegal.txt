{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Illegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code complexity (wmc=0), and only 28 lines of code (loc=28). It has minimal functionality with only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
