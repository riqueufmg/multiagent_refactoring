{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.Simple",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high Lines of Code (LOC) value of 575, which indicates it is quite large and potentially complex. With 9 fields (nof) and 0 methods (nom), the class appears to be data-heavy but lacks sufficient behavioral decomposition. The high LOC combined with minimal method count suggests insufficient modularization where the class could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more focused components."
