    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=29), a large number of fields (nof=35), and a significant lines of code (loc=1695). The lack of parameters in both fields and methods (nopf=0, nopm=0) suggests potential for decomposition into smaller, more cohesive units. The weighted method count (wmc=29) aligns with the method count, indicating each method is relatively simple, but the overall class complexity and size suggest insufficient modularization."
