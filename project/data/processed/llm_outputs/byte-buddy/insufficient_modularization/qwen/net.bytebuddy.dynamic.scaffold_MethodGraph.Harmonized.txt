{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Harmonized",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and minimal structural complexity (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0). The low LOC count (88) and absence of fan-in/fan-out dependencies indicate this is a simple, well-decomposed class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
