```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.FloatConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 3 public), low complexity (WMC=7), single level of inheritance (DIT=1), and reasonable size (83 LOC). The LCOM value of 0.75 indicates good cohesion within the class. There are no external dependencies that would suggest insufficient modularization. The metrics indicate a well-structured, focused class with appropriate decomposition."
