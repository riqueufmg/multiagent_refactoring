{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.AbstractBase",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of dependencies (42 external dependencies) and a large size (225 lines of code), indicating high complexity and insufficient decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0) and fields (nof=2) suggests that the class may be aggregating too much responsibility without proper modularization. The high number of dependencies combined with the size suggests that further decomposition could reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
