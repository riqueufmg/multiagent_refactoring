    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation.Illegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 19 lines of code (loc=19). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple inner class that represents an illegal stack manipulation state, which is appropriately minimal in its design and does not require further decomposition."
