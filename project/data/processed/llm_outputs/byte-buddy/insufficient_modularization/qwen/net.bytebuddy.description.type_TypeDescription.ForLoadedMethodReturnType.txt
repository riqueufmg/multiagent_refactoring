    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (0 methods, 0 fields, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0) and only 38 lines of code, indicating it is already well-decomposed and minimal in size. The class appears to be a specialized inner class with limited responsibilities, not exhibiting insufficient modularization."
