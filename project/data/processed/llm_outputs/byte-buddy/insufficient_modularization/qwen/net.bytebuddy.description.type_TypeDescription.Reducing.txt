    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Reducing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 method complexity (wmc=0), and only 82 lines of code (loc=82). The low number of fields (nof=2) and absence of inheritance (dit=0) indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or utility class with no implementation complexity that would benefit from modularization."
