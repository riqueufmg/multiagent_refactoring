    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 76 lines of code (loc=76). The low number of methods and fields, combined with the relatively small size, indicates that the class is already sufficiently modularized. There is no evidence of excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
