    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 23 and LOC of 235, contains 6 methods with 4 private methods indicating potential for decomposition, has LCOM of 0.667 suggesting poor cohesion, and contains nested classes (UnboxingResponsible, ExplicitlyTypedUnboxingResponsible) that could be extracted into separate modules, all indicators of insufficient modularization."
