    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 110 lines of code (loc=110). While the LOC is moderately high, the low number of fields and methods indicates minimal complexity. The WMC is 0, suggesting no method complexity. Without sufficient internal complexity or cohesion issues (LCOM=-1.0), there is insufficient evidence to conclude that further decomposition would be beneficial."
