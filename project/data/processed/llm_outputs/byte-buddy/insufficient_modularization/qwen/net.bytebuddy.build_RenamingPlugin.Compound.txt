    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RenamingPlugin.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 40 lines of code (loc=40), and minimal dependencies. The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. The class appears to be a simple compound structure rather than a complex class requiring further modularization."
