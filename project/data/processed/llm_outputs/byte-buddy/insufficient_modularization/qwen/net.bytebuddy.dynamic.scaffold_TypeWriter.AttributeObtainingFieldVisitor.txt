    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal lines of code (loc=28), and no internal fields (nof=1, nopf=0). The low WMC (0) and absence of class relationships (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
