    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 fields and 142 lines of code, but lacks sufficient metrics data (WMC=0, NOM=0, NC=0, DIT=0) to conclusively determine insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a nested Latent implementation with moderate size, but without method complexity metrics or clear evidence of multiple responsibilities, the smell cannot be confirmed."
