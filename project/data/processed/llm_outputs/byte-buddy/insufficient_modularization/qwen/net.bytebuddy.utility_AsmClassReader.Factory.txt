    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 106 lines of code. The lack of methods and low complexity indicates it is already sufficiently modularized. No further decomposition would be beneficial given its minimal functionality."
