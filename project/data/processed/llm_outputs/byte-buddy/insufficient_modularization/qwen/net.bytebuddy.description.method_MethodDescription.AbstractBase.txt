    "justification": "The class has a high LOC count of 479, indicating substantial size that suggests incomplete decomposition. The class directly depends on 10 external classes, showing high implementation complexity. With a DIT of 2, it's part of a hierarchy but lacks sufficient internal method count (nom=0, nopm=0) to justify its substantial size, indicating that further decomposition could reduce both its size and implementation complexity."
