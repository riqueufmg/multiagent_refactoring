    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (21), a large number of lines of code (1020), and a high LCOM value (0.875), indicating poor cohesion. It also contains multiple inner classes and numerous dependencies, suggesting that it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
