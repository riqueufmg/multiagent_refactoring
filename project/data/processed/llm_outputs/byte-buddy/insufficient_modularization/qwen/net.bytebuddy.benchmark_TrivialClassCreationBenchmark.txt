    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.TrivialClassCreationBenchmark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (79 LOC) and complexity (WMC=8, NOM=8) with reasonable method distribution. While it has some external dependencies (3 fanout), the cohesion appears acceptable (LCOM=0.375) and the number of fields (NOF=3) and methods (NOM=8) are within reasonable limits for a benchmark class. No clear indication of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
