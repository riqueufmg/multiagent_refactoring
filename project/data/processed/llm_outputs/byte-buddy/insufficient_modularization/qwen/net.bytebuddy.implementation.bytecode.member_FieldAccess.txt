{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.FieldAccess",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (191 LOC) with 4 methods and 6 fields. The WMC of 4 indicates low complexity, LCOM of 0.75 suggests reasonable cohesion, and the class has 3 private methods indicating some internal organization. While the class has dependencies on 10 other classes, this is not excessive for a class in this domain. The metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to have reasonable decomposition for its functionality."
