    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Assigner",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 427 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has 7 fields (nof) but no methods (nom), suggesting it may be a data-heavy class that could benefit from further modularization to separate concerns and reduce complexity."
