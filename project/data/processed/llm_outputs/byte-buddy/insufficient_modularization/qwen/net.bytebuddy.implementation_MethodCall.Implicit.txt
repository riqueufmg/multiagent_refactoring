    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 34 lines of code (loc). The low number of fields (nof=1) and lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
