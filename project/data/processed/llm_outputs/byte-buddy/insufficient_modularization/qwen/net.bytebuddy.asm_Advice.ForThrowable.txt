{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForThrowable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 100 lines of code (loc=100). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on 6 other classes, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low structural complexity (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0) indicates this class is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
