    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.RawAnnotatedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 146 lines of code (loc=146). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and simple structure suggests it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a data holder or simple container type."
