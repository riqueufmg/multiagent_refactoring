    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.CachingMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 4 fields (nof=4), and a low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lines of code (loc=81) are reasonable for a class with caching functionality. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be well-focused on its caching responsibility."
