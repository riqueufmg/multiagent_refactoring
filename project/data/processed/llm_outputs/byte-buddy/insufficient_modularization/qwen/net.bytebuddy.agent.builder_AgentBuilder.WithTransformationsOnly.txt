    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.WithTransformationsOnly",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=22 but this appears to be the file level), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and 0 fan-in/fan-out dependencies. The low number of methods and minimal complexity indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
