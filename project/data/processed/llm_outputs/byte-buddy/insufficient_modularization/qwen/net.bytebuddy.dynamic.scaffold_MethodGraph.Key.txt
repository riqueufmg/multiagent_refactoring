```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Key",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 23 fields (nof=23) and 776 lines of code (loc=776), indicating high size and complexity for a single class. With no methods (nom=0) but 23 fields, this suggests the class is likely a data-heavy structure that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high field count combined with substantial LOC suggests insufficient modularization as the class has not been completely decomposed."
