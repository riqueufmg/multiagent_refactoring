    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList.TypeSubstituting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 40 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no public methods or fields exposed. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest this is a simple data holder or auxiliary class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The class appears to be properly decomposed given its minimal functionality."
