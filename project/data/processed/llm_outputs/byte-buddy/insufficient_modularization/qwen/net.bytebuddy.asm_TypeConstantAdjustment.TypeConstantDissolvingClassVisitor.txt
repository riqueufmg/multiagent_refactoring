    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeConstantAdjustment.TypeConstantDissolvingClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 59 lines of code (loc=59). The low number of methods and fields, combined with the relatively small size, does not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a specialized visitor implementation with limited responsibilities, and its size and complexity metrics do not suggest it needs further decomposition."
