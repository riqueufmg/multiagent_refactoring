    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 18 lines of code (loc=18). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating no computational complexity. With no methods or fields to decompose, there is no insufficient modularization smell present."
