    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Detached",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=30 but this appears to be the file location rather than method count), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation with only 1 field (nof=1) and no parameters (nopf=0). There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly decomposed with minimal functionality."
