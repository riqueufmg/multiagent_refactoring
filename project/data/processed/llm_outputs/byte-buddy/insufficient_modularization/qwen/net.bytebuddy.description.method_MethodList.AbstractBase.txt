    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 49 lines of code (loc), depth of inheritance tree is 2 (dit), and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). The lack of methods and low loc indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No other complexity metrics (nof, nopf, nopm, nc, fanin, fanout) suggest excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
