    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 67 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The WMC is 0 indicating minimal complexity. While it has a moderate DIT of 2 and depends on 5 other classes, the low internal complexity and size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple abstract base class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
