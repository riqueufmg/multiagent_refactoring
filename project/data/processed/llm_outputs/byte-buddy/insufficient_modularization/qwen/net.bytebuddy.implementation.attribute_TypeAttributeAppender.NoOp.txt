```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.TypeAttributeAppender.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and minimal lines of code (loc=12). It also has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance (dit=1). This indicates a simple, well-decomposed class that serves a single purpose as a no-op implementation, rather than a case of insufficient modularization."
