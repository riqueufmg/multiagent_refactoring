    "justification": "The class has only 41 lines of code, 2 fields, 0 methods, and a low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0). The class appears to be a simple, focused implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
