{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.CollectionErasureMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 4 weighted method count (wmc=4), and 30 lines of code (loc=30). The lack of fields (nof=1, nc=0) and simple method count (nopm=2 out of 3 methods are public) indicates proper modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the low method count and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
