    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 74 lines of code (loc=74). While the class has some complexity indicated by dependencies on 7 external classes, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
