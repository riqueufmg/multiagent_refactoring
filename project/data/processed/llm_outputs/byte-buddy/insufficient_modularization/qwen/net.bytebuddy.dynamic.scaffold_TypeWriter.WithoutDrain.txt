{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithoutDrain",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. While the class has 75 lines of code (loc=75), this is likely due to the nested class structure and boilerplate code rather than complex functionality that requires modularization."
