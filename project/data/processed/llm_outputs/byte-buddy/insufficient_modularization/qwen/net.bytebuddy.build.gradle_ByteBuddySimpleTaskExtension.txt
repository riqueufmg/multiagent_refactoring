    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddySimpleTaskExtension",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 7 methods (nom=7), 42 lines of code (loc=42), and low weighted method count (wmc=7). The lack of complexity and relatively small size indicate sufficient modularization. The class also has a low LCOM value (0.4285714285714285) suggesting good cohesion, and with only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), it demonstrates appropriate encapsulation."
