{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType.LatentTypeWithSimpleName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 20 lines of code (loc=20). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class is nested (indicated by the dot notation in the class name), its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, well-contained class with limited responsibilities."
