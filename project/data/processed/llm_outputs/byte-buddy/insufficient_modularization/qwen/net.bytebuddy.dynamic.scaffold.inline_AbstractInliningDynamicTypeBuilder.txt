{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.AbstractInliningDynamicTypeBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 2 fields (nof=2), with a low lines of code count (loc=48) and low weighted method count (wmc=2). The lack of complexity indicators such as high method count, high cyclomatic complexity, or numerous dependencies suggests that the class is already sufficiently modularized. Although it has many external dependencies (23), these are likely necessary for its purpose as an abstract builder class in a complex framework like Byte Buddy, and do not indicate insufficient modularization."
