{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (68), a large number of lines of code (4937), and a high number of dependencies (68), indicating high complexity and insufficient decomposition. The lack of private fields and methods (nopf=0, nopm=0) suggests poor encapsulation and modularization. The class likely contains multiple responsibilities that should be separated into smaller, more cohesive classes."
