    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2) and a low weighted method count (wmc=2). The lines of code (loc=217) are reasonable for a class with 7 fields. The class has a depth of inheritance of 1, indicating it's not part of a complex inheritance hierarchy. The negative LCOM value suggests good cohesion among the methods and fields. With only 2 methods and no public methods, the class appears to be well-contained and not overly complex, indicating sufficient modularization."
