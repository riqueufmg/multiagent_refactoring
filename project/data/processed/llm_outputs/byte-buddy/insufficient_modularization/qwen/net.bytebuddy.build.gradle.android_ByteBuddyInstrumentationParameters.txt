    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyInstrumentationParameters",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4) and 25 lines of code (loc=25), which indicates a small and simple class. With 0 fields (nof=0) and 0 dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit complexity that would require further modularization. The low method count and minimal size suggest sufficient modularization has been achieved."
