    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Validator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 229 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The class has 6 fields (nof) but no methods (nom), suggesting it may be a data-heavy class that lacks proper behavioral decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) combined with substantial size indicates insufficient modularization where functionality should be broken down into separate, cohesive units."
