    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 41 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no outgoing dependencies beyond the basic inheritance and annotation usage. The class appears to be a simple data holder or nested class with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
