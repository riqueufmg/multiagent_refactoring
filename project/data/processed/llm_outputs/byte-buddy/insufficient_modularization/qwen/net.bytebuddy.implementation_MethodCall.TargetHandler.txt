    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.TargetHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 615 lines of code (loc) and 24 fields (nof), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom: 0) suggests poor decomposition where functionality may be embedded within large, complex field initializations or nested structures rather than being properly modularized into separate methods. This level of complexity and size in a single class indicates insufficient modularization as it has not been completely decomposed to reduce implementation complexity."
