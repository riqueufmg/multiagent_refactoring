{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 fields and 0 methods, with 126 lines of code. While the LOC is moderately high for the number of methods, the low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. The WMC of 0 and absence of complex method structure suggests the class is not overly complex despite the line count."
