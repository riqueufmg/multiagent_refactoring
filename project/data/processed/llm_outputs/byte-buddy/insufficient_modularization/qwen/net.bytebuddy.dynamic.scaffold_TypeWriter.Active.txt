    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Active",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=40 but this appears to be the file level, not class level), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The class also has minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no fields (nof=1, nopf=0). Given the extremely low complexity and minimal functionality, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
