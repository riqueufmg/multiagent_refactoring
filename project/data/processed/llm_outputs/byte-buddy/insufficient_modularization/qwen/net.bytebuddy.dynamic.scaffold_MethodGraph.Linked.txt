    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Linked",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 69 lines of code (loc=69). The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies to other classes (fanout=0), suggesting minimal complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
