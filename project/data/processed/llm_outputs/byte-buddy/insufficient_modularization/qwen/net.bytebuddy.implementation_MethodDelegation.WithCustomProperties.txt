{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.WithCustomProperties",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 300 lines of code (loc=300). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low number of fields and methods suggests it may be a data class or simple configuration class rather than a complex class requiring decomposition. The WMC of 0 indicates no method complexity, and the negative LCOM value suggests good cohesion among the existing elements."
