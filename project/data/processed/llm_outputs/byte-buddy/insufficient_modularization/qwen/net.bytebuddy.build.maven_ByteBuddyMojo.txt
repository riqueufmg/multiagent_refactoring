{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 37 fields (nof=37) and 25 private/protected fields (nopf=25), 5 methods (nom=5) with only 1 private/protected method (nopm=1), and a high WMC of 38 indicating complex implementation. The LOC is 971 which is quite large for a single class. The class also contains multiple inner classes (TransformationLogger, Transformer, Coordinate, ForDiscoveredPlugin, StalenessFilter) and numerous dependencies, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
