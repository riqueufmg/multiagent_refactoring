{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForDelegation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 163 fields (nof=163) and 3230 lines of code (loc=3230), indicating excessive size and complexity for a single class. The high number of dependencies (21 external classes) suggests that this class is handling too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The lack of methods (nom=0) despite the high number of fields and lines of code indicates poor internal structure and insufficient modularization."
