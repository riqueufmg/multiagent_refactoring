```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyAnnotationValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 305 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has 12 fields (nof) which suggests it is managing too much state and could benefit from further modularization. The lack of methods (nom: 0) despite having fields suggests the class may be a data holder that could be better structured, and the high line count indicates complex implementation that could be simplified through proper decomposition."
