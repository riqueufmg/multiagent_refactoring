{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor.MetadataAwareClassVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 39 methods (nom=39) and 332 lines of code (loc=332), indicating high size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=44) further confirms high implementation complexity. With only 2 attributes (nc=2) but 39 methods, the class appears to have too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high method count relative to attributes suggests insufficient modularization."
