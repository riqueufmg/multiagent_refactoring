    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.FieldLocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof: 5) and 0 methods (nom: 0), with 145 lines of code (loc: 145). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and lack of complex metrics (wmc: 0, nc: 0) suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The absence of methods (nopm: 0) indicates it's not performing complex operations that would benefit from modularization."
