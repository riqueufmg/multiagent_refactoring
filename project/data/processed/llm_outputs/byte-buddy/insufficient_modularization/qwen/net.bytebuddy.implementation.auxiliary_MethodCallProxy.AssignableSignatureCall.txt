    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lines of code (loc=29) are relatively small and the class appears to be a simple auxiliary class. There is no evidence of high complexity or size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
