    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.DescriptionStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 293 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality. It has 11 fields (nof) but no methods (nom=0), suggesting it may be a data-only class that could be better decomposed. The lack of methods despite having dependencies on multiple external classes (TypePool, TypeDescription) suggests incomplete modularization where related functionality has not been properly extracted into separate cohesive units."
