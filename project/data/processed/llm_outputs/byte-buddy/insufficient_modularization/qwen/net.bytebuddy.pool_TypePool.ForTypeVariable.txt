    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForTypeVariable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 20 fields (nof=20) and 290 lines of code (loc=290), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient decomposition. The class likely contains too much responsibility and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
