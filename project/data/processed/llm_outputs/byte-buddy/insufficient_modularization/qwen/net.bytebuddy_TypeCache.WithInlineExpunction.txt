    "class": "net.bytebuddy.TypeCache.WithInlineExpunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 64 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, DIT is 1 showing no inheritance depth, and fanin/fanout are both 0 indicating no dependencies. While the class exists, its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, well-contained class."
