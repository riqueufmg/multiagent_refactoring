    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 10 fields (nof=10) and 205 lines of code (loc=205), indicating high size and complexity for a single class. The lack of methods (nom=0) suggests potential incomplete decomposition where functionality may be embedded in complex field initializations or nested structures. The high field count relative to methods indicates insufficient modularization as the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
