    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 51 lines of code (loc=51). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low field count indicate it is already well-decomposed. The class appears to be a simple data holder or record class with minimal complexity, not warranting further decomposition."
