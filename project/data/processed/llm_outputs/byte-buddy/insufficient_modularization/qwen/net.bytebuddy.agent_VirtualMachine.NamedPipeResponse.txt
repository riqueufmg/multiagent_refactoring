    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.NamedPipeResponse",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 47 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 dependencies. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. WMC is 0, NOM is 0, and there are no fan-in or fan-out dependencies, suggesting this is a simple data holder or minimal utility class that is already sufficiently modularized."
