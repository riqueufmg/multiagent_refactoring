    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 46 lines of code (loc). The low number of fields (2) and lack of dependencies (0 fanin, 0 fanout) indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
