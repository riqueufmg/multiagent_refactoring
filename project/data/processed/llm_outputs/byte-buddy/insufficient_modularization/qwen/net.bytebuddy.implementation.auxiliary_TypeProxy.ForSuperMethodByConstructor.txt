    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy.ForSuperMethodByConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 fields (nof=5), no methods (nom=0), and 52 lines of code (loc=52). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates it is already well-decomposed. No further decomposition is warranted given its simple structure and minimal responsibilities."
