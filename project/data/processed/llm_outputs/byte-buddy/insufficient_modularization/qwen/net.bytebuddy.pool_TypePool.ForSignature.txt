    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForSignature",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 332 lines of code (loc) which indicates high size, and has 10 fields (nof) with no methods (nom), suggesting poor decomposition where data and behavior are not properly organized. The lack of methods (nom=0) and high line count suggest this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce implementation complexity and improve modularity."
