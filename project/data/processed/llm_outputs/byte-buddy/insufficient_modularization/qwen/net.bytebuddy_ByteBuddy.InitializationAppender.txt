{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy.InitializationAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 37 lines of code, 1 field, and 0 methods. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class has minimal dependencies (3) and no fan-in or fan-out relationships. While nested classes can sometimes indicate insufficient modularization, this particular class appears to be a simple, well-contained component with low complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
