```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForDescriptionArray",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 266 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has 5 fields (nof) and depends on 4 external classes, suggesting it has multiple responsibilities that could be separated into distinct modules. The lack of methods (nom=0) despite having fields suggests the class may be a data holder that could be better modularized with related behavior."
