    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 127 lines of code (loc=127). While the LOC is moderately high for a class with few methods, the low method count and field count do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a data-focused class with minimal behavior that would benefit from further decomposition."
