    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 27 lines of code, 1 field, no methods, and zero complexity metrics (WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0). The LCOM value of -1.0 indicates perfect cohesion. There are no dependencies, suggesting this is a simple data holder or minimal implementation that does not require further decomposition."
