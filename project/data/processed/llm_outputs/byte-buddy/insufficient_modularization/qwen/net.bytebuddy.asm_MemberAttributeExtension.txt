```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 304 lines of code (loc) and 9 fields (nof), but only 1 method (nom) with a very low weighted method count (wmc) of 1. The high lines of code combined with low method count suggests the class may contain complex implementations within its single method that could benefit from decomposition. Additionally, the class has 10 dependencies, indicating it handles multiple responsibilities related to member attributes, field annotations, method annotations, and ASM visitor functionality, which suggests insufficient modularization as these concerns could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
