    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.MethodCall",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 3 fields (nof=3), and 66 lines of code. The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
