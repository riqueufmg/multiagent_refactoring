    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lines of code (loc=27) are minimal and the class appears to be a specialized inner class with limited responsibilities. There is insufficient evidence of complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
