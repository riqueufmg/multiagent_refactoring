    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 64 lines of code (loc), 3 methods (nom) with 2 private methods (nopm), and 3 fields (nof). It also has a high number of dependencies (40+), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The class contains multiple inner classes and interfaces (RedirectionProxy, MethodLocator, FieldResolver, ConstructorCall, ForParameterType, StaticFieldConstructor, ForImplicitType, DefaultMethodLocator, TypeLocator, Factory, AccessorProxy, Implicit, Unresolved), which indicates it could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. The WMC of 3 and LCOM of 0.0 also suggest moderate complexity that could benefit from modularization."
