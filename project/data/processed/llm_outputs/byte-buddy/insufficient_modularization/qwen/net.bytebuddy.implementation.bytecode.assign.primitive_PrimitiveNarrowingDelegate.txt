    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveNarrowingDelegate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (3 total, 2 public), low complexity (WMC=19), and reasonable size (180 LOC). The lack of fields (NOF=10, NOPF=0) and low LCOM value (0.667) suggest cohesive design. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies indicate limited coupling. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
