{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Reifying",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 51 lines of code, zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0), zero fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. While the class is nested (indicated by the dot notation in the name), its minimal size and complexity do not constitute insufficient modularization."
