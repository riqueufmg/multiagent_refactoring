    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ProvisioningState",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no nested classes (nc=0), the class is already well-decomposed. The LCOM value of 0.8 indicates good cohesion within the class. The low number of methods and fields suggests that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity."
