    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.CompoundIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 57 lines of code. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low WMC (0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or configuration class rather than a complex entity requiring modularization."
