    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 42 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or complex implementation that would benefit from further decomposition."
