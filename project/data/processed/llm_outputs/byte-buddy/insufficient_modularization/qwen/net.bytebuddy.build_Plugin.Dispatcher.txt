{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Dispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 25 fields (nof=25) and 481 lines of code (loc=481), indicating high size and complexity that suggests insufficient modularization. The lack of methods (nom=0) despite having many fields suggests poor decomposition where field-related logic may be scattered elsewhere or the class is not properly encapsulating behavior. The high field count without corresponding methods indicates the class likely contains too much data responsibility without adequate behavioral decomposition."
