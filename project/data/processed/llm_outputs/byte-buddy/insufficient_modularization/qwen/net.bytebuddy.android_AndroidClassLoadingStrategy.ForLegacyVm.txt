    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.ForLegacyVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, 27 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The LCOM value of -1.0 indicates good cohesion, and there are no dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships to suggest insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately simple and well-structured."
