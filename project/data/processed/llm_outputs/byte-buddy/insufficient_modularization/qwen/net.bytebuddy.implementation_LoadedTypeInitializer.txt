    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0) and 6 fields (nof=6, nopf=0) with a low weighted method count (wmc=2), indicating minimal complexity. The lines of code (loc=166) include necessary implementation details for a type initializer. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's a self-contained utility. The negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) indicates good cohesion among class members. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
