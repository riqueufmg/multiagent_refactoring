    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), and 152 lines of code (loc=152). While the LOC is relatively high for a class with no methods, the lack of methods and fields suggests this may be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class needing decomposition. The WMC of 0 indicates no complexity from method execution paths. Without additional methods or complex responsibilities evident from the metrics, there's insufficient evidence to conclude it suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
