    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.WithIllegalResolutionReattempt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=43 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and complexity indicates insufficient data to determine insufficient modularization, and the class appears to be a simple or auxiliary class rather than a complex one that needs further decomposition."
