    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and WMC of 0. While DIT is 4 indicating some inheritance depth, the class itself is minimal and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it lacks the complexity that would require further decomposition."
