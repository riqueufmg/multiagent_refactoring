    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.RecordComponentDefinitionAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 3 fields (nof=3), and 56 lines of code. The lack of methods and low field count indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or adapter with no implementation complexity that would benefit from modularization."
