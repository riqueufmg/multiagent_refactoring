    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom: 0, wmc: 0) and only 58 lines of code (loc: 58). It appears to be a simple, focused class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low number of fields (nof: 3) and lack of complex dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships suggest it is already well-decomposed."
