    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.CollectionElementMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 fields (nof=2), and low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lines of code (loc=41) are minimal, and there are no complex dependencies or high coupling metrics indicating insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
