    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 46 lines of code (loc=46). The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or configuration class rather than a complex entity requiring modularization."
