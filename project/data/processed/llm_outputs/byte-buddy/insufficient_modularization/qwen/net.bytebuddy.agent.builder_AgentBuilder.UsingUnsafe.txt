    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.UsingUnsafe",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 57 lines of code (loc=57). With no methods implemented in this class, there is no implementation complexity to decompose further. The class appears to be a simple container or configuration class that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
