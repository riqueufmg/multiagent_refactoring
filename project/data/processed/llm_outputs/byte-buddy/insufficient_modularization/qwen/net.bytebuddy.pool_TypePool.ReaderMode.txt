    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ReaderMode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 35 lines of code (loc=35). It also has minimal fields (nof=1) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low complexity metrics indicate proper modularization for this simple class."
