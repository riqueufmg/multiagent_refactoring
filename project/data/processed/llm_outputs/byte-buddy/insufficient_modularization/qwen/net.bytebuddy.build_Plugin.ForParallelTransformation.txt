    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForParallelTransformation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 fields (nof=12) and 209 lines of code (loc=209), but lacks sufficient metric data (wmc=0, nom=0, nc=0, dit=0) to conclusively determine insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a nested class (ForParallelTransformation within Plugin) which may have legitimate complexity. Without additional structural metrics or clear indicators of excessive complexity, insufficient modularization cannot be confirmed."
