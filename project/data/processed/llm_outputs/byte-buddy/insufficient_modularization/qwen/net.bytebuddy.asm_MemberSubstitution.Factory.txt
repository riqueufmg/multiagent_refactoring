    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 fields (nof=5), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and relatively small size (loc=46). The lack of methods and low field count indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
