    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.ForLegacyVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 22 lines of code and 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0). The lack of methods and low LOC indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No signs of insufficient modularization are present given the simplicity of the class."
