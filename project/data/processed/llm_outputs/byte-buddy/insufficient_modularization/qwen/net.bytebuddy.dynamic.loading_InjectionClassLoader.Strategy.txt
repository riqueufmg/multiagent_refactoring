{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.InjectionClassLoader.Strategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 31 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal complexity. While the class is small, there is insufficient evidence of incomplete decomposition or high complexity that would warrant further modularization. The low LOC and absence of any structural complexity metrics suggest this class is already sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
