    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.EmptyAsmClassReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely an empty or marker class. With only 49 lines of code (loc=49) and no complexity (wmc=0), the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition. The lack of any methods or fields suggests this is intentionally a simple placeholder or empty implementation pattern."
