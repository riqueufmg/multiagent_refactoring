{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithoutExceptionHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 23 lines of code (loc=23). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class may be a nested class, its size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, lightweight component with minimal responsibilities."
