{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.AnnotationAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low WMC (0). The LOC is 45 which is relatively small. While the class has dependencies on 8 other classes, the lack of methods and low complexity metrics indicate it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
