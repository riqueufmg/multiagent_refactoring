    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is a minimal or marker class. With only 88 lines of code (loc=88) and no complexity metrics indicating high complexity (wmc=0, nc=0), there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be properly decomposed given its minimal nature."
