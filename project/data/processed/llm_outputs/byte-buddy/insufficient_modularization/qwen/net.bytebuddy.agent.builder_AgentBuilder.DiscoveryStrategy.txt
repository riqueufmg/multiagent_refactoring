{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.DiscoveryStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 fields (nof=9) but no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating it is likely a data-only class or interface. The low method count and absence of complex behavior (wmc=0, nopm=0) suggest it is already well-decomposed. The LOC of 242 is reasonable for a class with 9 fields, and the lack of inheritance (dit=0) and coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate simplicity rather than insufficient modularization."
