{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ReturnTypeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=46 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and complexity indicates insufficient material for further decomposition, making it inappropriate to flag for insufficient modularization."
