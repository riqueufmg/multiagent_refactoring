    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Unresolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 12 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 weighted method count. The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. While it has a dependency on HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, this does not indicate insufficient modularization given the class's minimal scope and implementation."
