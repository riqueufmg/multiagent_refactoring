    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.CollectionItemMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 5 weighted method count (wmc=5), and 31 lines of code (loc=31). The lack of class dependencies (dit=0, nc=0) and low method count indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-contained matcher implementation with appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
