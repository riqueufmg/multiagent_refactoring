    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 174 lines of code (loc=174). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is likely a data class or simple configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further modularization."
