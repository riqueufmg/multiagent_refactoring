    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.OfFormalTypeVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 49 lines of code (loc=49), and minimal dependencies on only 2 external classes. The lack of methods (nopm=0, nopf=0, wmc=0) indicates it is likely a simple data holder or formal type variable representation rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The low field count and absence of complex behavior suggest sufficient modularization."
