{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForImplicitField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 1 field (nof=1), and only 56 lines of code (loc=56). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
