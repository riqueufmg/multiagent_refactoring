{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation.Invocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 72 lines of code (loc=72). With no methods and relatively few fields, the class is already minimally implemented and does not exhibit complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate sufficient modularization."
