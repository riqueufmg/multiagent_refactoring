    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy.InjectionDispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 73 lines of code (loc=73). While the class has some complexity in terms of lines of code, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0) indicates this might be a data-only class or interface, which doesn't exhibit the typical characteristics of insufficient modularization where complexity needs to be broken down."
