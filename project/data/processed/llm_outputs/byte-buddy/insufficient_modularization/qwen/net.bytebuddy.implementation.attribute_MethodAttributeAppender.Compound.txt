    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 39 lines of code (loc=39). It has no fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and no dependencies on other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
