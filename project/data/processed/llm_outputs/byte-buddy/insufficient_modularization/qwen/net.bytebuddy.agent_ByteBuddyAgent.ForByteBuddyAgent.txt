    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), and 131 lines of code (loc=131). While the class has some code, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) suggests this is likely a simple data class or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
