    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.MethodOverrideMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 66 lines of code (loc=66), and weighted method count of 12 (wmc=12). While the class has some complexity, it is relatively small and focused. The lack of class hierarchy (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it is well-contained. The class appears to be a specialized matcher implementation with appropriate cohesion (lcom=0.0), indicating methods are related to each other. The size and complexity are within reasonable limits for a single cohesive unit."
