    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 79 lines of code (loc=79). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is a simple data holder class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
