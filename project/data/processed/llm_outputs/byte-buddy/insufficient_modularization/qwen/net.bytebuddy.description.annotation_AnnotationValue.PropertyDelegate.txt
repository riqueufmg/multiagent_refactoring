{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.PropertyDelegate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 392 lines of code (loc), which indicates a large class size that suggests insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a nested class (PropertyDelegate) within AnnotationValue that likely contains complex logic that could be further decomposed into smaller, more manageable components. The high line count suggests that the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
