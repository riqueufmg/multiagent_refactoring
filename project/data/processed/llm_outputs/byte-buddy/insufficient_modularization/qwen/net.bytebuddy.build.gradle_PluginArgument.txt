    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.PluginArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods (nom=7) and 3 fields (nof=3), with only 68 lines of code (loc=68). The weighted method count (wmc=7) indicates low complexity. The lack of class dependencies (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) and zero lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0) suggest good internal structure. The class size and complexity are within reasonable limits for a single cohesive unit, and there is no evidence of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
