    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3). The lines of code (loc=226) are not excessive for a class with minimal behavior. The lack of methods suggests this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class needing decomposition."
