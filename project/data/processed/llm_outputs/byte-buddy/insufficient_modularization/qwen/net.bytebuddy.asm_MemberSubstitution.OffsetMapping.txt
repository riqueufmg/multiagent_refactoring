    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OffsetMapping",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 142 fields and 2356 lines of code, indicating excessive size and complexity for a single class. The high number of dependencies (17 external types) suggests it has multiple responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The lack of methods (nom: 0) combined with high field count indicates potential data-only structures that should be modularized."
