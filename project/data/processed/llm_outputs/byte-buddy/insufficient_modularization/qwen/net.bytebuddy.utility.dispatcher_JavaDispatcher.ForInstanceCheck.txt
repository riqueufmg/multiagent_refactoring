    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 31 lines of code (loc=31), and cyclomatic complexity of 0 (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low complexity metrics indicate this class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
