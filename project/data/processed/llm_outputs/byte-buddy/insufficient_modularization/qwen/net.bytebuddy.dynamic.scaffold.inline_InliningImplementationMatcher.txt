    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.InliningImplementationMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 44 lines of code (loc=44), and weighted method count of 4 (wmc=4). It has a good decomposition with LCOM value of 0.0 indicating cohesive methods. The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 1 private method (nopm=1), suggesting proper encapsulation. The depth of inheritance tree is minimal (dit=1) and there are no afferent or efferent couplings (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating the class is well-contained and not overly complex."
