    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (loc=34, wmc=0, nof=1, nom=0) indicating it is already well decomposed. With only 1 field and 34 lines of code, the class size is minimal and does not warrant further decomposition. The metrics suggest this is a simple, focused class that adheres to sufficient modularization principles."
