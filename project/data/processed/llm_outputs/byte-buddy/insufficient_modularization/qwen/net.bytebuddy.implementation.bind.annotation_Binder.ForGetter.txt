{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.ForGetter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 34 lines of code, 1 field, and 0 methods. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The low number of fields (1), methods (0), and overall size (34 LOC) indicate sufficient modularization."
