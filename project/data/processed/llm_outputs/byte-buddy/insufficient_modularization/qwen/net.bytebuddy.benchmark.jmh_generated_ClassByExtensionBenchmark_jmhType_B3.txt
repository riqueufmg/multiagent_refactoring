    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 18 lines of code and 256 fields which suggests it may be a data-only class or generated class. While the high number of fields (256) could indicate complexity, the low line count (18) and zero methods suggest this is likely a simple data structure or generated benchmark class rather than a complex class needing decomposition. The WMC of 0 and NOM of 0 confirm there are no methods to decompose."
