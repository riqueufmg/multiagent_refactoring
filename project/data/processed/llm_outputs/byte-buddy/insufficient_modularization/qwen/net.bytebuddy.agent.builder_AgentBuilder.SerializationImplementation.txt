    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.SerializationImplementation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6), 0 methods (nom=0), and 69 lines of code (loc=69). With no methods implemented and relatively few fields, the class does not exhibit high complexity or size that would indicate insufficient modularization. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) suggests this is likely a data-only class or placeholder, not a complex implementation requiring further decomposition."
