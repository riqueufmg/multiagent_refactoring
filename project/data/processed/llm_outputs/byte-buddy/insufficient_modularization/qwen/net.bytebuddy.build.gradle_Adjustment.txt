{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Adjustment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods (nom=6, wmc=6) and 177 lines of code (loc=177), which represents a moderate size. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and perfect cohesion (lcom=1.0), the class appears to be well-structured and focused. The absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's relatively self-contained. While the LOC is somewhat high, the low method count and good cohesion indicate sufficient modularization for its current responsibilities."
