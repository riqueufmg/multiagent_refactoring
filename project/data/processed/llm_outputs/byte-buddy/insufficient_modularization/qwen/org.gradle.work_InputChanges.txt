    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2) and 16 lines of code (loc=16), which indicates a very small and simple class. The lack of fields (nof=0) and low complexity metrics suggest adequate modularization rather than insufficient modularization. The class appears to be properly decomposed given its minimal functionality."
