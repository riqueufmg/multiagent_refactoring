{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ImplementationContextClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 24 lines of code (loc). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof) and no public fields or methods. The low fanin (0) and fanout (0) indicate limited dependencies. While it could potentially be further decomposed, its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, focused class with limited functionality."
