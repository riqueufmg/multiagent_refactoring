    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 23 lines of code (loc). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof) and no method parameters. The lack of methods and low LOC indicate it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
