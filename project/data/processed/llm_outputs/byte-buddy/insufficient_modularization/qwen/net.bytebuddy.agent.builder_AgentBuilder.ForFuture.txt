    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForFuture",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 22 lines of code (loc), 1 field (nof), no methods (nom), and zero weighted method count (wmc). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
