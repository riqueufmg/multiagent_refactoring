    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ResubmissionInstallationListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 fields but no methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0), indicating it is likely a data-only class or interface. The low method count and absence of complex behavior metrics (WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0) suggest minimal implementation complexity. While the class has 144 lines of code, this is likely due to field declarations and simple structure rather than complex logic requiring decomposition."
