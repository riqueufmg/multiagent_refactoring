    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size with 276 lines of code and 9 methods. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) of 42 indicates moderate complexity. With 263 fields, while high, this appears to be a generated benchmark test class which typically contains many fields for benchmark configuration. The low number of methods (9) and specialized nature of the class (benchmark testing) suggests this level of complexity is appropriate for its purpose. No clear indication that further decomposition would significantly reduce size or complexity."
