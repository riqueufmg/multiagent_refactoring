    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=5, NOM=3, LOC=164) and shows evidence of proper decomposition through its dependencies on related classes (Adjustment, Discovery, TaskExecutionGraphAdjustmentAction). The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion, and the small number of methods suggests appropriate modularization for its functionality."
