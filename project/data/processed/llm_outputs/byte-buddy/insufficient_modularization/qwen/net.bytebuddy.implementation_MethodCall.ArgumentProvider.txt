    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 23 lines of code, 1 field, and 0 methods. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies on other classes that would suggest insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation that does not exhibit signs of needing further decomposition."
