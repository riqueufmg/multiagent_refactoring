    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 fields (nof=16) and 169 lines of code (loc=169), which indicates a moderate-sized class. Without information about methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and with negative LCOM (-1.0), it's difficult to assess cohesion properly. The class has no public methods (nopm=0, nopf=0) which might indicate it's a data class or has restricted visibility. Given the moderate size and lack of method complexity metrics, there's insufficient evidence to conclude that further decomposition would be beneficial."
