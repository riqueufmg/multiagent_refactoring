```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList.Empty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 18 lines of code (loc=18). The Weighted Methods per Class is 0 (wmc=0) and fan-in/fan-out are both 0, indicating minimal functionality. This suggests the class is already sufficiently decomposed and represents a simple, lightweight empty implementation pattern rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
