```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForField",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 fields (nof=15) and 306 lines of code (loc=306), indicating high complexity and size that could benefit from further decomposition. The class appears to be a nested class (ForField) within Advice, suggesting it may be handling multiple responsibilities related to field advice processing. With no methods present (nom=0) but having fields and substantial LOC, this indicates the class likely contains significant implementation logic that could be better modularized into separate, smaller classes with more focused responsibilities."
