{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class serves as an abstract base class with minimal functionality that does not exceed reasonable modularization boundaries."
