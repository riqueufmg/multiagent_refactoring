    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal lines of code (loc=18), and only 1 nested class (nc=1). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating no method complexity. With no methods to decompose and minimal structural complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
