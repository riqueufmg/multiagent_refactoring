    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ContravariantBinding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 28 lines of code (loc=28), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
