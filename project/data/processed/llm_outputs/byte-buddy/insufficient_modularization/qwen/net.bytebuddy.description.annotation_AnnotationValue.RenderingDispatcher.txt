    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.RenderingDispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 1 private field (nopf=1), with 314 lines of code (loc=314). While the LOC is relatively high, the low number of methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and fields indicates minimal complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or utility class with limited functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. No signs of excessive complexity or size that would benefit from modularization."
