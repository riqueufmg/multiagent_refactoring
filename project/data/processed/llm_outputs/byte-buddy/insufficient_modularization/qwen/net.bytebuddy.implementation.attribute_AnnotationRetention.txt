    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationRetention",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 36 lines of code (loc=36), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to be well-focused and adequately modularized for its current functionality."
