    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Build",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 0 methods, with 69 lines of code. While the LOC is moderately high for the number of fields, the lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity (wmc=0, nc=0) indicate it is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The absence of method complexity metrics and low structural complexity suggest this class is sufficiently modularized for its current purpose."
