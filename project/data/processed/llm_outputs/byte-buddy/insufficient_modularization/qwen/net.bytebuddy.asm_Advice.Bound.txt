{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Bound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the class has dependencies on 5 other classes, its internal structure is minimal and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
