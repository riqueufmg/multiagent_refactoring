    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor.Unavailable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=34 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof=1) and no dependencies on other classes except for a build plugin annotation. The class appears to be a simple data holder or marker class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
