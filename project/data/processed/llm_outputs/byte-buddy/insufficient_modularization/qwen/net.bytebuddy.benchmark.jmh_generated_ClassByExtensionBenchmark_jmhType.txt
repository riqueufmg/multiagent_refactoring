    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 2 lines of code (loc=2). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0) and Lack of Cohesion in Methods is -1.0 (lcom=-1.0) which indicates no cohesion issues. The class appears to be a generated benchmark class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
