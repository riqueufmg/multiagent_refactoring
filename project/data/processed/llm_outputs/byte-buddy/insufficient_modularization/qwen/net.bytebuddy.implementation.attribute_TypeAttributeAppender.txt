    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.TypeAttributeAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 5 fields (nof=5), with a moderate size of 164 lines of code (loc=164). While the class has some dependencies (6 dependencies), the low number of methods and manageable complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
