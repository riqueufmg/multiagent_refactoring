    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Matching",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 47 lines of code. The low number of methods (0) and fields (3) indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex module requiring decomposition."
