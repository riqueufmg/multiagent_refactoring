    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.TransformedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 208 lines of code (loc=208). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and low complexity indicators suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The absence of method complexity metrics (wmc=0) and coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would warrant modularization."
