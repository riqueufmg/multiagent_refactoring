    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields and 0 methods, with 168 lines of code. While the LOC is relatively high, the low number of fields and methods indicates minimal complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. No signs of high complexity or insufficient modularization are evident from the metrics provided."
