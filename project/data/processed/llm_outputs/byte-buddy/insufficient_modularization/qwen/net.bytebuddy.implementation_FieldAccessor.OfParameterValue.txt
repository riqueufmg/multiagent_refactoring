    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 56 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0). The class appears to be a simple, focused implementation with minimal responsibilities. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already sufficiently decomposed given its simple nature and low complexity."
