    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 33 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0). The class appears to be a simple, well-focused inner class that doesn't exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There's no evidence of the class being overly large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
