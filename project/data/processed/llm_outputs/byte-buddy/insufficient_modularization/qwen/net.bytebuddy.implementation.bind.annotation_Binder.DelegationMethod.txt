{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.DelegationMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 41 lines of code (loc=41), and weighted method count of 0 (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex implementation that needs modularization."
