    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Chain",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 197 fields (nof=197) and 4143 lines of code (loc=4143), indicating excessive size and complexity that suggests insufficient modularization. The high number of dependencies (22 external classes) further supports that this class handles too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
