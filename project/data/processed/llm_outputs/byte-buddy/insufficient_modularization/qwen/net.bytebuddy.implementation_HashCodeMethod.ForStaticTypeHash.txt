    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods or fields to decompose further, and the class being extremely small and simple, there is no indication of insufficient modularization."
