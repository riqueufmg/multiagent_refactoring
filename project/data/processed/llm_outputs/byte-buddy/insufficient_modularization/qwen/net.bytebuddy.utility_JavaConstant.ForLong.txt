    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.ForLong",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. There are no dependencies on other classes beyond TypeDescription, and no fan-in or fan-out relationships. The class appears to be a simple, well-decomposed unit with minimal size and complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
