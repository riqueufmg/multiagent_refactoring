    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 11 lines of code and 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0). It appears to be a simple data holder or marker interface rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The metrics indicate minimal size and implementation complexity, not supporting the presence of Insufficient Modularization."
