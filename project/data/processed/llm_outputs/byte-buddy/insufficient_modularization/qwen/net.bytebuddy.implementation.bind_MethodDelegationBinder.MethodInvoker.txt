    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.MethodInvoker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and only 46 lines of code (loc=46). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While it's a nested class, its size and complexity are appropriately low, suggesting sufficient modularization has been achieved."
