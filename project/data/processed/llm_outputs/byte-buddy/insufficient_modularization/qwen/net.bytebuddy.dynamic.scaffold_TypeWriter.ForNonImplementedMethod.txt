    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForNonImplementedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 public methods (nopm), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 68 lines of code (loc). The lack of methods and low LOC indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, focused implementation with no signs of insufficient modularization."
