```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.MethodConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics (WMC=20, LOC=388) and contains inner classes (MethodConstant.CanCacheIllegal, MethodConstant.CanCache), indicating it handles multiple responsibilities. The class has 11 methods with only 5 being public, suggesting internal complexity that could be decomposed. The low LCOM value (0.1818181818181818) indicates high cohesion but the overall size and complexity suggest insufficient modularization as the class could be further decomposed to reduce implementation complexity."
