    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 84 lines of code (loc=84). While the class has some complexity indicated by 6 dependencies and being a nested class, the low method count and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a specialized component with focused responsibilities within the bytecode manipulation domain."
