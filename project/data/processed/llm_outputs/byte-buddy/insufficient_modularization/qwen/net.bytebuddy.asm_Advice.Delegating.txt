    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Delegating",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 21 fields (nof=21) and 611 lines of code (loc=611), indicating high size and complexity that suggests insufficient modularization. The lack of methods (nom=0) and high line count suggest this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
