    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 29 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 complexity metrics (WMC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or marker class with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The dependencies are typical for a utility/helper class and do not indicate insufficient modularization."
