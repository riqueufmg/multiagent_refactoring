    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 15 lines of code (loc=15). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods or fields to decompose further, and the low size and complexity metrics, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
