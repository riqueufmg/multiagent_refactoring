    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.Loaded",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 26 lines of code (loc=26). The lack of methods and low size indicate that further decomposition is not necessary. The class appears to be a simple, well-modularized component with minimal implementation complexity."
