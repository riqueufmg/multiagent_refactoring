{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithExitAdvice",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 254 lines of code (loc) which is excessively large for a single class, indicating insufficient decomposition. The class contains 4 fields (nof) but no methods (nom), suggesting that the implementation logic is likely embedded within the enclosing Advice class rather than being properly modularized. The lack of methods in this inner class while maintaining a substantial code footprint (254 loc) indicates that further decomposition could reduce its size and implementation complexity."
