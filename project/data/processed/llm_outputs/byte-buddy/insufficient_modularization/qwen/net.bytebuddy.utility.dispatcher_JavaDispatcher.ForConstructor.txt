    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 42 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and no dependencies on other classes. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal complexity. While it's a nested class, its size and complexity are appropriate for its functionality, showing sufficient modularization."
