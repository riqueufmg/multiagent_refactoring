    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 40 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of significant functionality and complexity indicates it does not suffer from insufficient modularization."
