{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Element",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 143 lines of code (loc=143). While the class has a moderate number of fields, the lack of methods and relatively low line count do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition. The metrics do not suggest that the class is overly complex or large enough to benefit from additional modularization."
