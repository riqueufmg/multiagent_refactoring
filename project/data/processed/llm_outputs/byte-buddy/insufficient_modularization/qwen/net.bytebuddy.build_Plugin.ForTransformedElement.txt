    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 34 lines of code (loc=34), and no dependencies on other classes within the provided data. The low number of fields (nof=2) and absence of methods suggest it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
