    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess.OffsetWriting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 23 lines of code, 1 field, no methods, and no inheritance hierarchy (DIT=0). The lack of methods (NOM=0, WMC=0) and minimal field count (NOF=1) indicates it is already highly decomposed. There are no signs of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class with minimal responsibilities."
