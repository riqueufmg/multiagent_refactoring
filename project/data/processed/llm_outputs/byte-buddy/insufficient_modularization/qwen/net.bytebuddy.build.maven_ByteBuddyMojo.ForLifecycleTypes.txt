    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields and 0 methods, with a very low LOC count of 144. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT is 1 showing no inheritance hierarchy. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest this is a simple data holder class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
