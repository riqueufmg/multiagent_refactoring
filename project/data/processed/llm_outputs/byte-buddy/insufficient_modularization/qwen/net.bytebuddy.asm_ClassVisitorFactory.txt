{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (39), methods (11), and lines of code (971), indicating it may be handling too many responsibilities. The high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) value of 15 suggests significant internal complexity. Additionally, the class has a high number of dependencies (34), which implies it is coordinating or managing multiple functionalities that could potentially be decomposed into separate modules or classes to improve modularity and reduce complexity."
