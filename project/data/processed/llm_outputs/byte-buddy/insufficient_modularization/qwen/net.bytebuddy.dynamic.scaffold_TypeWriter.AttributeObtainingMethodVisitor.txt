    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.AttributeObtainingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal lines of code (loc=48), and no internal fields (nof=2, nopf=0). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple, focused visitor implementation with minimal responsibilities, showing sufficient modularization for its current scope and complexity."
