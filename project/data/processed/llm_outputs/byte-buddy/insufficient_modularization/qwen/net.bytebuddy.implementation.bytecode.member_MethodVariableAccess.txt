{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 309 lines of code (loc=309), indicating high implementation complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=16) further confirms the complexity is distributed across multiple methods. The class also contains nested classes (MethodVariableAccess.NoOp, MethodVariableAccess.MethodLoading, MethodVariableAccess.TypeCastingHandler) which suggests it is handling multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
