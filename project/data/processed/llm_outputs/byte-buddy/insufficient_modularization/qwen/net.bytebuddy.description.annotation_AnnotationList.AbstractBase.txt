    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 96 lines of code, depth of inheritance tree is 2 which is moderate, and no methods or fields are present (nom=0, nof=0). The negative LCOM value suggests good cohesion among the inherited members. Without other classes or packages to compare against, and given the relatively small size and moderate complexity, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that further decomposition would be beneficial."
