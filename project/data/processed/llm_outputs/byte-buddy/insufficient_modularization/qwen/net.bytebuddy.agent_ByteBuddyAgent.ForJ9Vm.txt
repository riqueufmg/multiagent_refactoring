{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.ForJ9Vm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. Since the class is already very small and simple, there is no indication that further decomposition would provide benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity."
