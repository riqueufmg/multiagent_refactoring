{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForExitValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 116 lines of code (loc=116). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on 7 other classes, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) indicates this may be a data-only class or nested class with limited responsibilities, which does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization where further decomposition would be beneficial."
