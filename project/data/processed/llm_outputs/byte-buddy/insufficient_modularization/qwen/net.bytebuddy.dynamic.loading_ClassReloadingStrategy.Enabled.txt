    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 22 lines of code (loc=22). With minimal functionality and low complexity, there is no indication that further decomposition would provide benefits. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple nature."
