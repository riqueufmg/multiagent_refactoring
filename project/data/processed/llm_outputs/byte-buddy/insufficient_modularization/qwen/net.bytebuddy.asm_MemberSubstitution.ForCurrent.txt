    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForCurrent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 95 lines of code (loc=95). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on 9 other classes, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) indicates this may be a data-only class or nested class that is appropriately simple. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition."
