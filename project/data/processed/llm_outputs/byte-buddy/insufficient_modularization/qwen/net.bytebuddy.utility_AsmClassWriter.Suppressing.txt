    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 40 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), and no internal complexity (wmc=0, nc=0). The class appears to be a simple, well-focused component that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of functionality that could be further decomposed into smaller, more manageable pieces."
