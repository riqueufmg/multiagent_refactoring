    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to have a single responsibility. The LCOM value of 0.6 indicates reasonable cohesion. The class has no fanin or fanout dependencies, suggesting it's relatively isolated but not overly complex. Given these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
