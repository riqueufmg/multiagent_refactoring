{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.UrlDefinitionAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 fields (nof=8) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 141 lines of code (loc=141). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and field count indicate reasonable modularization. The class appears to be a data-focused class with minimal behavior, which does not exhibit the complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
