{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.TypeCache",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with all being public (nopm=8), and 369 lines of code (loc=369). The high line count combined with multiple methods suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The class also has a WMC of 20, indicating moderate complexity that could be reduced through better modularization."
