    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RenamingPlugin.Renaming",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 103 lines of code (loc=103). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicators suggest this is a simple data class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The class does not exhibit characteristics of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a lightweight, focused class with minimal responsibilities."
