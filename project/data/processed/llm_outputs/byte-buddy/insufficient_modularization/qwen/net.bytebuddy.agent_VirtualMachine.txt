```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 70 fields and 2449 lines of code, indicating high size and complexity. It also contains 12 inner classes/dependencies (PosixOwnerProvider, ForJnaSolarisDoor, PosixLibrary, ForJnaPosixSocket, Factory, Dispatcher, WindowsAttachLibrary, Connection, WindowsLibrary, SolarisLibrary, ForJnaWindowsNamedPipe, MacLibrary) that are tightly coupled to it, suggesting insufficient decomposition. The high number of fields (nof=70) and lines of code (loc=2449) combined with multiple nested dependencies indicate the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
