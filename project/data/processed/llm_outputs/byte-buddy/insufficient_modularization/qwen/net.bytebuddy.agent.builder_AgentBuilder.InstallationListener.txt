```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.InstallationListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 4 fields (nof=4, nopf=0). The lines of code (loc=356) are distributed across a relatively small number of fields and no methods, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) and low field count (nof=4) suggest the class is already sufficiently decomposed or serves a simple purpose. LCOM value of -1.0 indicates good cohesion among the existing elements."
