    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Minimal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 37 lines of code, 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, lightweight class that is already sufficiently modularized."
