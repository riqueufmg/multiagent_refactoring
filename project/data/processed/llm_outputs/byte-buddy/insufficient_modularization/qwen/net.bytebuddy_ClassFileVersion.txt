    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 26 methods (nom), 36 fields (nof), and a WMC of 34, indicating significant implementation complexity. The class contains 476 lines of code (loc) which is substantial for a single class. The presence of nested classes (VersionLocator, Resolver) and numerous dependencies (6 external dependencies) suggests that this class is handling multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
