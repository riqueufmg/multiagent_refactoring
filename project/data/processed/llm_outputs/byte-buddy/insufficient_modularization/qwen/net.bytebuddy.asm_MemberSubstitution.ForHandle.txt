    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForHandle",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 fields (nof=10) and 102 lines of code (loc=102) but no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). While the class has a moderate number of fields and lines of code, the lack of methods suggests it may be a data-only class or configuration holder. However, without method complexity metrics or clear indicators of high complexity or large size that would warrant decomposition, and considering the class might be appropriately sized for its purpose, insufficient modularization cannot be definitively detected with the provided metrics."
