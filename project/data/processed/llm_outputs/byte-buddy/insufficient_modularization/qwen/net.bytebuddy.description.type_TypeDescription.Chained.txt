    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Chained",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=28 but this appears to be the file location rather than class size), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of methods and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition is not necessary as the class is already minimally complex."
