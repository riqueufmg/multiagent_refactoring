    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 31 lines of code. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. With nom=0 and wmc=0, there are no methods to decompose further, and the low field count suggests appropriate cohesion."
