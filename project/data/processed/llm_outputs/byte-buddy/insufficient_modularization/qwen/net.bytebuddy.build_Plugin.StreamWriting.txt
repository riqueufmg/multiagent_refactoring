    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.StreamWriting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 114 lines of code (loc=114). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal field count indicate it is already well-decomposed. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
