    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.ForExactType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 50 lines of code (loc=50). The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), suggesting minimal complexity. With such few responsibilities and low complexity, further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in reducing size or implementation complexity."
