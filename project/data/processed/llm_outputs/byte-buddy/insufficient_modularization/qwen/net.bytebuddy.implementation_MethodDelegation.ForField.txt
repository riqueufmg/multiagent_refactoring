    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.ForField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 135 lines of code. While the class has dependencies on 9 other classes, the low number of fields and methods suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The absence of methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) indicates this may be a data-only class or configuration holder rather than a complex implementation that requires further decomposition."
