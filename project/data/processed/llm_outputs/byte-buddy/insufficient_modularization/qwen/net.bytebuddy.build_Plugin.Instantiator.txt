    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Instantiator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields (nof=7) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 170 lines of code (loc=170). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, the low method count and fields suggest reasonable modularization. No complex metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, lcom=-1.0) indicate insufficient data to confirm complexity issues, and fanin/fanout are both zero, suggesting limited external dependencies or usage."
