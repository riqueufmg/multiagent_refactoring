    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lines of code (loc=40) are minimal and the class appears to be a simple, focused implementation. There are no indicators of excessive size or complexity that would suggest insufficient modularization."
