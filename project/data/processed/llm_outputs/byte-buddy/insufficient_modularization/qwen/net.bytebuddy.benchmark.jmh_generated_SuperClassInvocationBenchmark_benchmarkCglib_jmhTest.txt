    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 263 lines of code and 9 methods, which is within reasonable limits for a JMH-generated benchmark test class. The WMC of 42 indicates moderate complexity. The class appears to be a generated test class with a specific purpose, and its structure is appropriate for its role as a benchmark test wrapper. No clear indication of insufficient modularization as the class seems to serve a single, well-defined purpose."
