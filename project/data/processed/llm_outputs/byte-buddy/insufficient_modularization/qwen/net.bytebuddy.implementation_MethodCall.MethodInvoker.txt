    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 220 lines of code (loc=220). While the class is nested within MethodCall, it does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a focused, lightweight component with minimal complexity."
