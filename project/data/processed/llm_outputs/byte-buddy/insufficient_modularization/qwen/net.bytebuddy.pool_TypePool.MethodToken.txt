{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.MethodToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 20 fields (nof=20) and 170 lines of code (loc=170), but Insufficient Modularization cannot be detected without knowing the actual complexity and responsibilities of the class. The metrics show no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and no inheritance (dit=0), but the lack of method count and complexity metrics (wmc=0) prevents proper assessment of whether decomposition is needed. The class appears to be a data holder/token class based on its name and dependencies, which may be appropriately simple despite having many fields."
