    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.OfWildcardType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 369 lines of code (loc) which is excessively high for a single class, indicating it likely contains too much functionality that should be decomposed into smaller classes. It has 10 fields (nof) and 1 private field (nopf), suggesting significant data complexity that could benefit from modularization. The class also has multiple dependencies (7 external classes) which indicates it's handling complex responsibilities that could be better separated into distinct modules."
