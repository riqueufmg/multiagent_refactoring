{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 29 fields (nof=29) and 844 lines of code (loc=844), indicating high size and complexity. It also has multiple nested classes and dependencies (11 dependencies listed), suggesting it could be further decomposed. The low number of methods (nom=3) relative to the high number of fields suggests poor modularization where functionality is likely spread across nested classes rather than being properly decomposed."
