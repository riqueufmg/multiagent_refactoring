{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 510 lines of code (loc) and 18 fields (nof), which indicates high size and complexity for a single class. The lack of methods (only 3) relative to the high number of fields and lines of code suggests that the class likely contains too much responsibility and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high line count and field count without corresponding method complexity (wmc=3) indicates insufficient modularization where functionality could be better distributed."
