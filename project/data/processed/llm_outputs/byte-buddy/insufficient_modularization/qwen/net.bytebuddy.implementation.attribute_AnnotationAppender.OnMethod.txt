    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender.OnMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 28 lines of code (loc=28). It has minimal functionality with only 1 field (nof=1) and no parameters. The class appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of complex implementation that would benefit from further decomposition."
