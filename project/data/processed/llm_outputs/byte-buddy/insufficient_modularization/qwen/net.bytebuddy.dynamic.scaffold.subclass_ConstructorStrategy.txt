{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.ConstructorStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2) and a low weighted method count (wmc=2), indicating simple implementation. The lines of code (loc=256) include nested classes and documentation. The class has a clear single responsibility with 4 fields (nof=4) and no parameters in methods (nopm=0, nopf=0), suggesting focused functionality. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies indicates it's not overly connected to other components."
