    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForIndex",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5), 0 public fields (nopf=0), 0 methods (nom=0), and 103 lines of code (loc=103). While the LOC is moderately high for a class with no methods, the low number of fields and methods suggests it may be a data-only class or inner class with limited functionality. Without additional complexity metrics indicating high implementation complexity or clear decomposition opportunities, there is insufficient evidence to conclude it suffers from Insufficient Modularization based on the provided metrics alone."
