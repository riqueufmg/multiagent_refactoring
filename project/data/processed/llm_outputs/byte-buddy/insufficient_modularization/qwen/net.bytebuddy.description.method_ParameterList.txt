    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (505 LOC) and complexity (WMC=4, NOM=4) for its functionality as a parameter list implementation. The high number of fields (NOF=19) is justified by the class's responsibility to manage parameter metadata. The class appears to be well-focused on its core responsibility without evidence of insufficient modularization."
