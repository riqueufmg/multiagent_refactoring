    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 42 lines of code (loc=42). It has minimal functionality with only 1 field (nof=1) and no dependencies on other classes except for a plugin annotation. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already quite simple and decomposed."
