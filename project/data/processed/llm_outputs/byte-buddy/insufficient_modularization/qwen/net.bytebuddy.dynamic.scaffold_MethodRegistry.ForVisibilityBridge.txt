    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.ForVisibilityBridge",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 public methods (nopm=0), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lines of code (loc=41) are relatively low and the class appears to be a specialized inner class (ForVisibilityBridge) with minimal responsibilities. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already quite simple and decomposed."
