    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 172 lines of code (loc=172). The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would suggest insufficient modularization."
