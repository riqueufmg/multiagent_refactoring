{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.WindowsLibrary",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields with 3 private fields, 0 methods, and 76 lines of code. While the LOC is moderately high for a class with no methods, the low number of fields and absence of methods suggests it may be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0, wmc=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from modularization."
