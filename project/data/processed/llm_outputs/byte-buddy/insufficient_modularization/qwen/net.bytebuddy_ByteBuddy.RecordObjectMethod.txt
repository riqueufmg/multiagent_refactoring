{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy.RecordObjectMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields (nof=4), 0 methods (nom=0), 63 lines of code (loc=63), and weighted method count of 0 (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or configuration object rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
