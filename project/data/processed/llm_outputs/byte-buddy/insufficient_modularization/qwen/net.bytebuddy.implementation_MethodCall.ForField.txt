{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 138 lines of code (loc=138). While the LOC is relatively high for the number of methods, this appears to be a nested static class (ForField) that is part of the MethodCall implementation. The low method count and field count suggest it is already well decomposed, and the code size is likely due to implementation details rather than insufficient modularization."
