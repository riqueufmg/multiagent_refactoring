{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.WithoutSpecifiedTarget",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 114 lines of code, DIT of 1 indicating no inheritance hierarchy, and zero methods (nom=0) and fields (nof=0) reported. The lack of structural complexity and inheritance suggests sufficient modularization. While the class has dependencies on 4 external classes, this alone does not indicate insufficient modularization as the class itself appears to be a simple, focused component."
