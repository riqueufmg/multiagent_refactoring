{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ArgumentLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 fields (nof=28) and 794 lines of code (loc=794), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The high number of fields and substantial code size imply that the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
