{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingReflection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 29 fields (nof=29) and 1057 lines of code (loc=1057), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) and high number of dependencies (9 dependencies listed) suggest insufficient decomposition where related functionality could be grouped into separate modules. The high line count combined with substantial field count indicates the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that should be separated into distinct modules."
