    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.ConstructorResolver.TypeLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0, loc=83) and no internal dependencies. While the LOC is relatively high for a class with no methods, the metrics suggest this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The absence of methods and complexity indicators does not support insufficient modularization."
