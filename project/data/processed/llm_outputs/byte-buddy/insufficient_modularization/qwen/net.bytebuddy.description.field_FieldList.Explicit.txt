    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 36 lines of code (loc=36). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No code smells indicators such as high complexity, large size, or numerous dependencies are present."
