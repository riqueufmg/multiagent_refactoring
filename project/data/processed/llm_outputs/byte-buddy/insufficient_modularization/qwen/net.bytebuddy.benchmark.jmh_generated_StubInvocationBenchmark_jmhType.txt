    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 2 lines of code (loc=2). It has a depth of inheritance of 4 (dit=4) but this is not indicative of insufficient modularization given the extremely simple structure. The class appears to be a generated benchmark class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
