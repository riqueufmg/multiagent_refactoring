    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ReaderFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 36 lines of code (loc=36), and no class-level complexity (nc=0, lcom=-1.0). It appears to be a simple factory class with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The low number of fields (nof=2) and lack of methods suggest it is already sufficiently modularized for its current purpose."
