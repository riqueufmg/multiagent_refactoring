    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a reasonable size with 276 lines of code and 263 fields, which is typical for JMH-generated benchmark test classes. The WMC of 42 indicates moderate complexity, and the low number of methods (9 total, 8 public) suggests focused functionality. While the high field count might seem concerning, this is characteristic of generated benchmark classes that need to maintain various state configurations for performance testing. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies indicates isolation, which is expected for test classes."
