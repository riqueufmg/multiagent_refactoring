{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.SelfContained",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 31 lines of code (loc=31). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While it has dependencies on two external classes, the class itself is already highly decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition to reduce size or complexity."
