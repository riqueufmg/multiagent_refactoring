    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 36 lines of code, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), and no dependencies. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal complexity. While the class is nested (dit=2), its size and complexity are within acceptable limits and do not indicate insufficient modularization."
