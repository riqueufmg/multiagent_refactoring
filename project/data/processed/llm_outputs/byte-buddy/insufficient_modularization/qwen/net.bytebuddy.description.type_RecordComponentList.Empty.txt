    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentList.Empty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is already minimally decomposed. With only 24 lines of code (loc=24) and no complexity (wmc=0), the class does not exhibit size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The lack of methods and fields suggests this is likely a marker or placeholder class that serves a specific minimal purpose."
