{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ClassFileVersionMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with low complexity (wmc=3), 2 fields (nof=2), and 30 lines of code (loc=30). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity, indicates adequate modularization. There is no evidence of insufficient decomposition as the class appears to be properly sized and structured."
