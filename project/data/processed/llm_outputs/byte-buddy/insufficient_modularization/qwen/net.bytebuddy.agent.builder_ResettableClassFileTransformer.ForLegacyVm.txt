    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer.ForLegacyVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. There are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance (dit=0). This suggests the class is already sufficiently decomposed or is a simple data holder/utility class that doesn't require further modularization."
