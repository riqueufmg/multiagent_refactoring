    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 41 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and WMC of 0. The low number of fields (1), methods (0), and overall size (41 LOC) indicate sufficient modularization. There is no evidence of incomplete decomposition or excessive size that would suggest insufficient modularization."
