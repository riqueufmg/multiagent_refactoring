{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Generic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 132 fields (nof=132) and 5738 lines of code (loc=5738), indicating excessive size and complexity. It also has a high number of dependencies (21 external classes) which suggests it is handling too many responsibilities. The lack of methods (nom=0) might indicate that the logic is embedded within the fields or inherited complexity, and the high LCOM value (lcom=-1.0, indicating severe lack of cohesion) confirms insufficient modularization where the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more cohesive units."
