{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForJarOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 64 lines of code. The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. No inheritance hierarchy exists (dit=0) and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond ClassFileLocator, suggesting this is a simple, focused component."
