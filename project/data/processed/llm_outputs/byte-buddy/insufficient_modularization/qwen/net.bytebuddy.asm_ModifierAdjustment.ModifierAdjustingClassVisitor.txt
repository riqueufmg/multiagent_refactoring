    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ModifierAdjustment.ModifierAdjustingClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields and 0 methods, with 92 lines of code. While the LOC is moderately high for the number of fields, the lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and the fact that it's likely a specialized visitor class suggests it may be appropriately focused. The WMC of 0 indicates no method complexity, and the negative LCOM suggests cohesive structure. Without additional complexity metrics or clear decomposition opportunities evident from the provided data, this does not clearly indicate insufficient modularization."
