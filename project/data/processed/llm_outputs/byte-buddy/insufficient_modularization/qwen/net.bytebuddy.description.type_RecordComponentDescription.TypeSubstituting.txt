    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription.TypeSubstituting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 64 lines of code (loc=64). While the class has some complexity indicated by its dependencies on MethodDescription, RecordComponentDescription, and TypeDescription, the low number of methods and fields suggests it is already reasonably decomposed. The class appears to be a specialized component with focused responsibility rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
