    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 fields (nof=19) and 275 lines of code (loc=275), indicating high size and complexity that suggests insufficient decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0) and high field count suggests this class could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
