    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 53 lines of code (loc=53), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) suggests minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
