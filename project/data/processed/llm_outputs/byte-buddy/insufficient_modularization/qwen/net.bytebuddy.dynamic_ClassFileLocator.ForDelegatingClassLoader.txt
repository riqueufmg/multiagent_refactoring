    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 168 lines of code (loc=168). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and simple field structure indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit complexity that would benefit from further modularization."
