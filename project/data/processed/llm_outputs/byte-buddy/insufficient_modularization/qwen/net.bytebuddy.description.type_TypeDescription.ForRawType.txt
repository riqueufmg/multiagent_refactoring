{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForRawType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=46 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and complexity indicates insufficient data to determine insufficient modularization, and the class appears to be a simple or placeholder implementation rather than an under-decomposed complex class."
