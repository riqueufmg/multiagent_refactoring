    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 18 lines of code, no fields, no public fields, no methods, no public methods, and zero weighted method count. The class appears to be a simple, well-decomposed component that does not exhibit insufficient modularization. Its small size and zero complexity metrics indicate it is appropriately modularized."
