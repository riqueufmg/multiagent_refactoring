    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields (nof=4), no methods (nom=0), 44 lines of code (loc=44), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
