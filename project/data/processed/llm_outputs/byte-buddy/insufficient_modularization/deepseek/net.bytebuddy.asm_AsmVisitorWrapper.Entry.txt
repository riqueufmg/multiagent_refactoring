    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only two fields (nof=2), indicating minimal internal complexity. The lines of code (loc=37) are low, and the lack of cohesion (lcom=-1.0) suggests no method interactions to decompose. No indication exists that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
