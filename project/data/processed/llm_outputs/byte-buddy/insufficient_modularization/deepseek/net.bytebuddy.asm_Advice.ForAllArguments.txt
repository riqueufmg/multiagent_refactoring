    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForAllArguments",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a moderate size (145 loc) and only fields (nof=9), with no methods (nom=0). While it may contain complex field initialization logic, the absence of methods and low metric values (wmc=0, lcom=-1, fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate it does not currently have high implementation complexity that would warrant decomposition based solely on the provided data."
