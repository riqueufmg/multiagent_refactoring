    "justification": "Class has 261 lines of code (loc) and 12 fields (nof) with no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating a large data structure that could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity. The high field count suggests multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, focused classes."
