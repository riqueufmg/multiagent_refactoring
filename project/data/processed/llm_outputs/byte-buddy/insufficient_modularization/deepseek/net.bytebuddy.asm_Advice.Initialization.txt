    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Initialization",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating no functionality to decompose. The 49 lines of code (loc=49) likely represent structural or declarative elements (e.g., class definition, comments) rather than procedural complexity, and the weighted method count (wmc=0) and lack of dependencies further suggest minimal complexity, making further decomposition unnecessary."
