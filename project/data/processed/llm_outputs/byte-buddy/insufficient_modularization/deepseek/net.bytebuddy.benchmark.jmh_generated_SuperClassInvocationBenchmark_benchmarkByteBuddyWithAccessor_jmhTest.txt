    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has extremely high field count (nof=263) and moderate method count (nom=9), which suggests it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The high WMC (42) indicates significant implementation complexity that could be reduced through modularization, despite moderate LOC (276) and low LCOM (0.0)."
