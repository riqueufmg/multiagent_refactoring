    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ClassLoaderResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 94 lines of code with only 4 methods, resulting in an average of 23.5 lines per method, which indicates long methods that may be doing too much. This suggests that further decomposition into smaller methods or helper classes could reduce implementation complexity and improve modularity."
