    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only two fields (nof=2) and no methods (nom=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the lines of code (loc=42) are relatively high, this likely results from comments or annotations rather than functional code, so further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
