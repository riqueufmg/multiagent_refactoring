    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 42 lines of code (loc=42) and contains 2 fields (nof=2) but 0 methods (nom=0). This indicates a lack of functional decomposition where all code exists in a single monolithic block without modular methods, suggesting it could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
