    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom) and 148 lines of code (loc) with 4 fields (nof), but no methods indicate no behavioral complexity. Modularization typically targets classes with high implementation complexity or size driven by methods; here, the absence of methods suggests no clear decomposition opportunity based on behavior."
