    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy.SilentConstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted methods per class (wmc=0), indicating low implementation complexity. Although it has 14 fields and 105 lines of code, the absence of methods suggests that further decomposition would not significantly reduce complexity."
