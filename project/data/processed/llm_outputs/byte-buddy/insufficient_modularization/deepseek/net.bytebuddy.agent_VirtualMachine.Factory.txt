    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.Factory",

    "justification": "The class has only one field and no methods, with zero weighted methods per class (WMC=0). Its lines of code (31) are not indicative of high implementation complexity given the absence of methods and constructors, and further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
