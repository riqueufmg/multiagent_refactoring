    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 fields (nof=4), zero methods (nom=0), and minimal lines of code (loc=58). The weighted method complexity is zero (wmc=0), indicating no implementation complexity to decompose. The class already has a single responsibility as indicated by its primitive type specialization in the TypePool context."
