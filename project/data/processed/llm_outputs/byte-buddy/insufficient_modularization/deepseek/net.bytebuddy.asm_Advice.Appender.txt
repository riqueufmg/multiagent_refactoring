    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only 6 fields (nof=6), with low complexity (WMC=0). The lines of code (84) are moderate and likely consist of field declarations and initializations. There is no indication of multiple responsibilities or high implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
