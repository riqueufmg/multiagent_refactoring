    "justification": "Class has 37 fields (25 public) and 971 lines of code, indicating large size. With only 5 methods and high weighted method complexity (38), it exhibits high implementation complexity. The presence of 3 inner classes suggests partial decomposition, but the main class remains large and complex, so further decomposition could reduce both size and complexity."
