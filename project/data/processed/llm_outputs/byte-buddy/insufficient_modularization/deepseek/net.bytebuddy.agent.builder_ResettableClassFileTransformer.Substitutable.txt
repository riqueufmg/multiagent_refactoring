    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer.Substitutable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods and 136 lines of code, indicating high size relative to functionality. With 0 methods, the complexity is not distributed and the class lacks functional modularization. The high LOC suggests it may contain procedural code or complex initializers that could be decomposed into separate methods or classes to reduce size and complexity."
