    "justification": "The class exhibits high cohesion (LCOM=0) and moderate complexity (WMC=23). While it has a large number of methods (23) and lines of code (228), the high cohesion suggests the methods are closely related, and further decomposition may not reduce complexity without compromising cohesion."
