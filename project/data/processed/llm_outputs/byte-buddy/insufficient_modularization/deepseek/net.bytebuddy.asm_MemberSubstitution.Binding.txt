    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Binding",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 125 lines of code (loc) and 7 fields (nof) with 0 methods (nom), indicating it may contain substantial implementation complexity concentrated in field initializers or inner logic without functional decomposition. The negative LCOM value (-1.0) suggests no method interactions to assess cohesion, but the combination of high loc, multiple fields, and no methods implies insufficient decomposition of responsibilities."
