    "justification": "The class has 42 lines of code (loc=42) but 0 methods (nom=0) and only 1 field (nof=1), indicating a concentration of functionality that is not decomposed into methods. This can lead to increased complexity and reduced readability, suggesting further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
