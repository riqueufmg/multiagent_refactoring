    "justification": "The class has 12 fields and 146 lines of code with 0 methods, indicating it is primarily a data holder with high complexity concentrated in a single class. The lack of methods and high field count suggests it may be handling multiple responsibilities or configurations that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive classes to reduce size and complexity."
