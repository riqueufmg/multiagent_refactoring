    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.BridgeMethodImplementation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 56 lines of code (loc) but 0 methods (nom). A class with significant size (loc) and no methods suggests that its functionality is not decomposed into discrete, reusable units. This indicates insufficient modularization, as the class likely contains inline or monolithic code that could be broken down into methods to reduce size and complexity."
