    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only one field (nof=1), indicating minimal functionality. Despite having 63 lines of code (loc=63), the weighted method complexity is zero (wmc=0) and lack of cohesion is not applicable (lcom=-1). There is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
