    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.InitializationStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 354 lines of code (loc) but zero methods (nom), indicating a high volume of code without functional decomposition. This suggests the class contains substantial implementation complexity, likely from nested classes or extensive initialization code, that could be modularized into separate classes to reduce size and complexity."
