    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForTypeDescription",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only 4 fields (nof=4), indicating low complexity. Although the lines of code (loc=135) are relatively high, this could be due to non-functional elements such as comments or formatting, and without methods, the class is likely a simple data holder that does not require further decomposition."
