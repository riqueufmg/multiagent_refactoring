    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.FieldPersistence",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low size (46 LOC, 5 methods, 1 field) and low complexity (WMC=5). Further decomposition would not significantly reduce size or implementation complexity given the small scale. The LCOM of 0.6 is moderate but not indicative of a clear need for splitting in such a small class."
