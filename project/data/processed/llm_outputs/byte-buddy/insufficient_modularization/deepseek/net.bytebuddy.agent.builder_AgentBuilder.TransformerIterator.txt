    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.TransformerIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (WMC=0) and a moderate number of fields (7), indicating low implementation complexity. While LOC is 85, the absence of methods suggests limited functional complexity, and further decomposition is unlikely to significantly reduce size or complexity."
