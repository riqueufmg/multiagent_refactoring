    "justification": "Class has 49 lines of code (loc=49) but 0 methods (nom=0), suggesting monolithic or unstructured implementation. High code-to-method ratio indicates potential lack of decomposition. LCOM value of -1.0 also suggests the class may have no cohesive methods to group, hinting at mixed responsibilities or procedural code."
