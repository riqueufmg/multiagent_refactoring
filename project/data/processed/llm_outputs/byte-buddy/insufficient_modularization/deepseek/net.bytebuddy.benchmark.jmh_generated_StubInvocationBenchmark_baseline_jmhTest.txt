    "justification": "Class has 263 fields (nof=263) and 42 weighted methods per class (wmc=42), indicating extremely high structural and behavioral complexity. This large size and complexity suggest it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
