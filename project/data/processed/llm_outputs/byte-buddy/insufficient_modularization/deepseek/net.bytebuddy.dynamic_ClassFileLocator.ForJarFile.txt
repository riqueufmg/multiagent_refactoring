    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForJarFile",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 181 lines of code (high size metric) with 0 methods and 3 fields, indicating a potentially large monolithic structure despite having no methods. The negative LCOM value suggests no cohesive behavior is present, and the class could benefit from decomposition to separate concerns represented by its dependencies (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, StreamDrainer) into distinct modules."
