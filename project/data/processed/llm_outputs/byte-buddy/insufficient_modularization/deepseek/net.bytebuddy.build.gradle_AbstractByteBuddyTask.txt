    "justification": "The class exhibits high cohesion (LCOM=0.09375) and moderate complexity per method (WMC=50, average 1.56). It already includes decomposition via 4 inner classes. While size (474 LOC, 32 methods) is notable, the low LCOM suggests focused responsibilities, making further decomposition unlikely to significantly reduce complexity or size."
