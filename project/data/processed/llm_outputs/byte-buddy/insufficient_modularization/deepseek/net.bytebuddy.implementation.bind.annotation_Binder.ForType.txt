    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.ForType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 41 lines of code (loc) with no methods (nom=0) and only 1 field (nof=1), yet still shows moderate size. Given the lack of methods, this suggests that the class may contain complex field initialization or static blocks that could potentially be decomposed. The non-zero fanout (2 dependencies) indicates coupling to external types, which might be better encapsulated through further decomposition."
