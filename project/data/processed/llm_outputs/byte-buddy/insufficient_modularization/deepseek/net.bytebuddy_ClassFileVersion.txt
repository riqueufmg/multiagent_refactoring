    "justification": "High number of fields (36 total, 26 public) and methods (26 total, 24 public) indicates excessive responsibility. High LOC (476) and WMC (34) suggest significant implementation complexity, while low LCOM (0.19) does not offset the size and complexity. Multiple inner classes in dependencies (VersionLocator, Resolver) hint at decomposed logic that could be separated further."
