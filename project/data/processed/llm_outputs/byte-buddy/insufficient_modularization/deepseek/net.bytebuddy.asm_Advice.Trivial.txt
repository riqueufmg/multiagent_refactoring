    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Trivial",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and 0 weighted methods (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The LOC (61) is moderate, but the absence of any methods or fields suggests the class is already highly focused and does not contain substantial logic to decompose."
