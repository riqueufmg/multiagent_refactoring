    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Resolution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof) and 0 methods (nom) with 71 lines of code (loc). While the loc is moderate, the lack of methods and minimal fields suggests the class is already focused and not overly complex, and further decomposition is unlikely to significantly reduce size or complexity."
