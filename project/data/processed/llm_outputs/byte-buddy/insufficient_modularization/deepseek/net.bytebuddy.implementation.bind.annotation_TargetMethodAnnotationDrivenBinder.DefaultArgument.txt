    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating zero implementation complexity, and only three fields (nof=3). While lines of code (loc=51) are moderate, the absence of methods and small field count suggest minimal structure; further decomposition would not reduce complexity or size significantly."
