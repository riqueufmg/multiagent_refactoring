    "justification": "Class has 46 lines of code (loc) but only 1 field (nof=1) and 0 methods (nom=0), indicating a potential single responsibility that could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity. The lack of methods suggests possible procedural code embedded in initialization blocks or static initializers."
