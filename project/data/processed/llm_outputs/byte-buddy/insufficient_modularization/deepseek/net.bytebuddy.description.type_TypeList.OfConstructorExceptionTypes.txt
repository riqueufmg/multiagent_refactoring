    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high lines of code (75) with zero methods and four fields, indicating a large, monolithic structure without functional decomposition. Its negative LCOM (-1.0) suggests a complete absence of method cohesion, and the presence of three dependencies without any methods implies complex internal data handling that could be encapsulated elsewhere."
