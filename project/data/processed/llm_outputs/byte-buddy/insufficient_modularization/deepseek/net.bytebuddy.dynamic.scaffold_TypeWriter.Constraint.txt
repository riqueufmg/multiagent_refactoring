    "justification": "The class has a very high LOC (1022) and contains 5 fields, yet it has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0). This indicates a large amount of code that is not organized into methods, suggesting low cohesion and a potential mix of responsibilities that could be separated into distinct modules."
