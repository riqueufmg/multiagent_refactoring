```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.PosixLibrary",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 fields (nof=9) including 3 public fields (nopf=3) and 111 lines of code (loc=111) with no methods (nom=0, nopm=0). This combination of high field count, public field exposure, and substantial code volume without methods suggests the class handles multiple responsibilities or contains complex initialization logic that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes with proper encapsulation."
