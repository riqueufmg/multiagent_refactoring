    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), and no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Its size (loc=77) is not excessive for a class without decomposition opportunities. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
