    "justification": "The class has only 12 lines of code (loc=12), no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), and zero weighted methods per class (wmc=0), indicating minimal size and implementation complexity. With no internal structure and only one dependency, further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
