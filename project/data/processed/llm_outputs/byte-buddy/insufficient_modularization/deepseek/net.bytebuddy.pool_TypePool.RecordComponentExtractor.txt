    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.RecordComponentExtractor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With 55 lines of code (loc=55) and 5 fields (nof=5), it functions as a simple data holder, and further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity significantly."
