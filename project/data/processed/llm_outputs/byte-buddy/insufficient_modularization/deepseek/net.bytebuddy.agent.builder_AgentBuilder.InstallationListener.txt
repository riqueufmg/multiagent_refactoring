    "justification": "Class has high complexity (loc=356) with 0 methods (nom=0) but contains 4 fields (nof=4), suggesting it may be handling multiple responsibilities or contains extensive initialization/logic that could be decomposed. The combination of high LOC and zero methods indicates potential embedded logic or anonymous classes that could be modularized separately."
