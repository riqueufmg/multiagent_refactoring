    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity and size, indicated by 360 lines of code, 38 methods, and 16 fields, suggesting multiple responsibilities. The WMC of 41 and multiple dependencies also point to a lack of decomposition. Despite low LCOM, the overall metrics imply insufficient modularization."
