    "justification": "Class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 4 fields (nof=4), indicating minimal behavioral complexity. While LOC is 93, the absence of methods and low field count suggests limited implementation complexity. No evidence of multiple responsibilities or high complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
