{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 307 lines of code (loc) and 8 methods (nom), which indicates high implementation size and complexity concentrated in a single class. The class handles multiple responsibilities including list operations, filtering, and annotation processing as evidenced by dependencies on TypeList, FilterableList, and ElementMatcher. This combination suggests the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused components."
