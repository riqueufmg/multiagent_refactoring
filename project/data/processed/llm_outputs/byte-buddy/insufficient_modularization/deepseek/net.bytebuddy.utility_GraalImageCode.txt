    "justification": "Class has only 6 methods and 125 lines of code, with moderate WMC (12) and low LCOM (0.5), indicating reasonable size and cohesion. It already contains an inner class (ImageCodeContextAction) for decomposition, and there is no evidence of high complexity or multiple responsibilities that necessitate further modularization."
