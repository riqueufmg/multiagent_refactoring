    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3), indicating low implementation complexity. Although the lines of code (loc=66) is moderately high, it is likely due to declarative code rather than complex logic, and further decomposition is not justified to reduce size or complexity."
