    "justification": "High LOC (542) relative to low number of methods (4) and one field (1) suggests a large, monolithic class. Low cohesion (LCOM=-1) and 16 external dependencies indicate the class aggregates multiple responsibilities, which could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
