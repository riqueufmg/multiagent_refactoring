    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating no functionality or state to modularize. While the lines of code (loc=55) are relatively high, this may be due to non-functional elements such as comments or whitespace, and does not necessarily indicate a need for decomposition."
