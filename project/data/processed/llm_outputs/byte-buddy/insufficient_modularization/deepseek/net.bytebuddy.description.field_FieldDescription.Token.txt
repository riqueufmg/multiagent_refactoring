    "justification": "The class has high lines of code (loc=102) and multiple external dependencies (fanout=4) relative to its small number of fields (nof=4) and absence of methods (nom=0), suggesting it may be handling multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
