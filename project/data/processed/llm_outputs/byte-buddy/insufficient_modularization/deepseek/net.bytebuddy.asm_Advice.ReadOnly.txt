    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ReadOnly",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), and zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0). Despite having 32 lines of code (loc=32), the absence of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity, and further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
