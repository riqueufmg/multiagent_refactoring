    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3) with 47 lines of code (loc=47), indicating minimal complexity. It exhibits low weighted method count (wmc=0) and no internal coupling (lcom=-1.0), suggesting it is already well-modularized with no clear decomposition opportunities."
