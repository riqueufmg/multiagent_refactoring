{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.NamedElement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 classes (nc=6) within a single file, indicating multiple nested/inner classes that could potentially be decomposed into separate classes. Additionally, with 3 fields (nof=3) and 72 lines of code (loc=72) for a class with only 1 method (nom=1), there is likely poor separation of concerns and low cohesion among the inner classes."
