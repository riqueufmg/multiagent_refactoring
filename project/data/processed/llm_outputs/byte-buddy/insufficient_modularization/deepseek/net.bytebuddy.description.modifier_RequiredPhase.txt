    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small (loc=46, nom=5, nof=1) and has low weighted method complexity (wmc=5). The LCOM of 0.8 is not unusually high given the single field, indicating typical cohesion for a class with few fields and methods. No significant indicators (e.g., very high loc, wmc, or low cohesion) suggest that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
