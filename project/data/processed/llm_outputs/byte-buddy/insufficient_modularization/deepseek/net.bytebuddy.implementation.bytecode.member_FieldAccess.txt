    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has moderately high size (191 LOC) and low cohesion (LCOM=0.75) despite only 4 methods and 6 fields, suggesting multiple responsibilities that could be separated. The existence of inner class FieldAccess.Defined indicates partial decomposition has already occurred, but further decomposition could reduce complexity."
