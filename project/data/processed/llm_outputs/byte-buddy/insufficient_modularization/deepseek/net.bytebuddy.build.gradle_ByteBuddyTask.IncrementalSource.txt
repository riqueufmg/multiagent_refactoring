    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTask.IncrementalSource",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The inner class has 66 lines of code with 4 fields but 0 methods, indicating it may be handling multiple responsibilities within its implementation that could be decomposed into separate, focused classes. The absence of methods suggests potential procedural code within the class that is not captured by method metrics, and the moderate size (66 lines) for a class without methods indicates insufficient decomposition of its logic."
