    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating minimal functionality. Its weighted method count (wmc=0) and lines of code (18) are low, suggesting no significant complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The lack of cohesion (lcom=-1.0) is not applicable due to no methods. Therefore, further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
