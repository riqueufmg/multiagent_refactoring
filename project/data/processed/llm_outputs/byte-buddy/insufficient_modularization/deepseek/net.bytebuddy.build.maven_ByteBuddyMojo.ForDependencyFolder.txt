    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.ForDependencyFolder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only two fields (nof=2), resulting in low complexity (wmc=0). With only 39 lines of code (loc=39) and no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), it is already a simple, focused class. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
