    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), with only 4 fields (nof=4). While the lines of code (loc=75) are moderate, the absence of methods and low complexity indicate minimal behavior, making further decomposition unlikely to reduce size or complexity."
