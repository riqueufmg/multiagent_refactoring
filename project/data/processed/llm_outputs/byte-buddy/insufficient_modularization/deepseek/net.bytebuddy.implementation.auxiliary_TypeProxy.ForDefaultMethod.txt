    "justification": "Class has 35 lines of code (loc) but 0 methods (nom) and 3 fields (nof), suggesting potential under-decomposition. The absence of methods despite significant size and multiple dependencies indicates insufficient functional decomposition where responsibilities could be further modularized."
