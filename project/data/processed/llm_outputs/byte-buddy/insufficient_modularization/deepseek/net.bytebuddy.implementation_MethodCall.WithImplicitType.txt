    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0) and zero fields (nof=0), indicating minimal size and complexity. The lines of code (loc=22) do not suggest high implementation complexity when combined with the absence of methods and fields. No further decomposition is indicated as the class is already minimal."
