    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.FrameGeneration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 129 lines of code with only 2 fields and 0 methods, indicating a large monolithic structure with no functional decomposition. The high LOC-to-functionality ratio (129 LOC with no methods) suggests the class performs multiple responsibilities or contains complex implementations that could be broken down into smaller, more focused units."
