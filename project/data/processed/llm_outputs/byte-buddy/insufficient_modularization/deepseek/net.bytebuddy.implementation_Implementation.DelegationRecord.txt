    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only two fields (nof=2). Although LOC is 76, the lack of methods and low complexity (wmc=0) suggest no behavioral complexity to decompose. The class appears to be a simple data holder, and further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
