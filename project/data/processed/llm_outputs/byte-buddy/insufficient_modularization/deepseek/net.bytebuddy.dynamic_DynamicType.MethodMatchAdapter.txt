    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.MethodMatchAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal implementation complexity with 0 methods and 0 constructors, 1 field, and no internal dependencies suggesting further decomposition. The LOC of 87 is primarily due to being an inner class definition with dependencies only on external types, not indicating excessive internal responsibilities."
