    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0), minimal size (loc=39), and low complexity (wmc=0, dit=0). It shows high cohesion (lcom=-1.0) and no dependencies beyond a single external plugin. These metrics do not indicate excessive implementation complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
