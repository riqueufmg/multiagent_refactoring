    "justification": "The class has 121 lines of code (loc=121) but no methods (nom=0) and no constructors (nc=0). This large size with zero methods suggests all functionality is implemented in initializers or static blocks, indicating insufficient decomposition of responsibilities into methods or auxiliary classes."
