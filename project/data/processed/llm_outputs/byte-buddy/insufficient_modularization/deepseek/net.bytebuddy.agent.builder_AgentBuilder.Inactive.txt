    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Inactive",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity and no clear internal structure to decompose further. Its small size (loc=18) and lack of dependencies also suggest no benefit from additional modularization."
