    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 fields (nof=7) and 168 lines of code (loc=168) with no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating a data-heavy class that lacks behavioral decomposition. The lack of methods suggests insufficient encapsulation and modularization of responsibilities."
