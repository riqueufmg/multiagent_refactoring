    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType.NamingStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with a weighted method count of 0, indicating low complexity. Although it has 83 lines of code, the absence of methods suggests a single responsibility and limited behavior. Further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity significantly."
