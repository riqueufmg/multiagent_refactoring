    "justification": "The class has high lines of code (loc=99) and implements multiple responsibilities indicated by multiple dependencies (TypeDescription, FieldDescription, ModifierReviewable, CachedReturnPlugin), but exhibits low cohesion (lcom=-1.0) and has no methods (nom=0) or fields (nof=0), suggesting it has not been decomposed to separate concerns."
