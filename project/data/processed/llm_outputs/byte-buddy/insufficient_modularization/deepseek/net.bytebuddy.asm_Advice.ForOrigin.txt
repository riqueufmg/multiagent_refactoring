    "justification": "Class has high lines of code (289) and a relatively high number of fields (11), while having no methods (nom:0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc:0). This suggests the class may be handling multiple responsibilities or complex logic through fields and initialization blocks, which could be decomposed into separate classes or methods to reduce implementation complexity and improve modularity."
