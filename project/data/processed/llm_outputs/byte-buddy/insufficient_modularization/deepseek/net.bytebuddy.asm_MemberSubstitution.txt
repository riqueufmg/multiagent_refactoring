    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution",

    "justification": "The class has very high metrics indicating excessive size and complexity: 292 fields (nof), 6597 lines of code (loc), and 16 methods (nom) with 16 weighted method complexity (wmc). It also contains numerous inner classes (visible in dependencies), suggesting the class has grown too large and could be decomposed further to reduce size and complexity."
