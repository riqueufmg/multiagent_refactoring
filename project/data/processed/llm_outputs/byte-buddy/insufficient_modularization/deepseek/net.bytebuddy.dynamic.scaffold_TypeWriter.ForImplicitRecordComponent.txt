    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForImplicitRecordComponent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field, no methods, and 0 weighted method complexity (WMC). With 50 lines of code (LOC) and no internal implementation complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. The dependencies are all external types for annotations and descriptions, not indicating excessive internal responsibility."
