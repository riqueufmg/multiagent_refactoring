    "justification": "The class has 437 lines of code (high size) and 12 fields, indicating a large and potentially complex class with multiple responsibilities. The presence of 3 inner classes suggests further decomposition could be achieved by extracting these inner classes into separate top-level classes, reducing overall size and complexity."
