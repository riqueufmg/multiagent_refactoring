    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.ClassByExtensionBenchmark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class exhibits high cohesion (LCOM = 0.17) and moderate size (LOC = 309) with low average method complexity (WMC/nom ≈ 1.09). The high number of methods (nom = 23) is typical for a benchmark class, and the low LCOM suggests the methods are tightly related, indicating that further decomposition is unlikely to reduce complexity or size effectively."
