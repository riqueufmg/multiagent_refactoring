    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin.ExitAdviceByteCodeAppender",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 62 lines of code (loc) and 5 fields (nof) but 0 methods (nom), indicating a high ratio of code to methods and suggesting that significant functionality may be embedded in initializers or complex field declarations. This lack of method decomposition, coupled with a relatively high line count for a class with no methods, implies potential for reducing size and complexity by modularizing the code into separate methods or classes."
