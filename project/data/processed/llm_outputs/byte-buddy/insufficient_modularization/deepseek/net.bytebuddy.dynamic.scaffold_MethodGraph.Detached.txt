    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), only one field (nof=1), and low lines of code (loc=30). Weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) and it has minimal dependencies. There are no indicators of implementation complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition."
