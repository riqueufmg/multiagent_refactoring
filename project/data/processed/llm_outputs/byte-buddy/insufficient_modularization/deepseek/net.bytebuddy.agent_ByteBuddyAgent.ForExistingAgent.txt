    "justification": "The class has only one field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), with zero complexity (wmc=0) and no dependencies. Its size (loc=22) is moderate, but the absence of methods and minimal state suggests no clear opportunity for further decomposition to reduce size or complexity."
