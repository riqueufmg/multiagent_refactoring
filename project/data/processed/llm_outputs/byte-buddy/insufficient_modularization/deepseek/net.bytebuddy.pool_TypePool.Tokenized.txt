    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only one field (nof=1) but contains 22 lines of code (loc=22) and depends on 5 external types, indicating it likely contains inline complex logic that could be decomposed into separate methods or classes to reduce size and complexity."
