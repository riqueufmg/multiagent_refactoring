{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 95 lines of code (loc=95) and contains 7 classes (nc=7), indicating multiple inner classes. This suggests that the class has not been completely decomposed, and further decomposition by moving inner classes to top-level could reduce its size and implementation complexity."
