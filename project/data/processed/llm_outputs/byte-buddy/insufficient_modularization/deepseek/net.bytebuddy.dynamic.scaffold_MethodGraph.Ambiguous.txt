{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Ambiguous",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 179 lines of code (loc) but 0 methods (nom), indicating a high amount of code without modularization into methods. This suggests the class may have multiple responsibilities or complex initialization that could be decomposed into smaller classes or methods to reduce size and complexity."
