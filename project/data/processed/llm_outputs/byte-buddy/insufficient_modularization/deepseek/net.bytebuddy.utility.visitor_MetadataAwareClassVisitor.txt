    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class exhibits high cohesion (LCOM=0.0) and moderate size (332 LOC, 39 methods). Although the number of methods is relatively high, the low weighted method complexity (WMC=44) and high cohesion suggest that the class is focused and further decomposition may not reduce size or complexity significantly."
