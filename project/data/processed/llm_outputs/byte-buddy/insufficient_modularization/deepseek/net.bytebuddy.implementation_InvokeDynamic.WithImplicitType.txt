    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted methods per class (wmc=0), indicating low implementation complexity. The number of fields (nof=5) is moderate, and lines of code (loc=132) are not excessively high. The low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and lack of inheritance (dit=0) suggest limited external dependencies, reducing the need for further decomposition."
