    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating no implementation complexity. The lines of code (loc=53) are moderate, and the weighted method count (wmc=0) is zero. There is no evidence of high complexity or multiple responsibilities that would require further decomposition."
