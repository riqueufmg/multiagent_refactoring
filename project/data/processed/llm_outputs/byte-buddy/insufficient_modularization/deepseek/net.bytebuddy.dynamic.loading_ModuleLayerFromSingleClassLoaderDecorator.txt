    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 407 lines of code (high size), 17 fields, and a Lack of Cohesion of Methods (LCOM) value of 0.75, indicating low cohesion among its methods and fields. This suggests multiple responsibilities within the class. Furthermore, its 4 methods must handle the complexity of managing numerous dependencies and fields, indicating that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and complexity."
