    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.FieldToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 fields and 0 methods, indicating it is a simple data holder with no behavioral complexity. Its 59 lines of code are moderate, and the lack of methods (WMC=0) suggests minimal implementation complexity. The class appears cohesive, as it likely groups related field metadata, and further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
