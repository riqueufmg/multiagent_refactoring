    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only one field (nof=1), indicating minimal functionality. The lines of code (loc=41) may include non-functional elements, and without methods, there is no implementation complexity to reduce. Further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity."
