    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 155 lines of code, 5 methods, and a weighted method complexity of 14, which are within typical thresholds for a single responsibility. The lack of cohesion of 0.6 is moderate but not extreme, and given the small number of methods and fields, further decomposition is not clearly justified."
