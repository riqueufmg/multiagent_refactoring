    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 1 field (nof=1) with 31 lines of code (loc=31). It exhibits no method complexity (wmc=0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the absence of methods and a single field, there is no functional complexity to decompose, and the class is already minimal in structure."
