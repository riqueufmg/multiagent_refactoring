    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ModifierMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4) and low weighted method complexity (4), high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), and moderate size (136 lines). These metrics suggest the class is focused and not overly complex, so further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity significantly."
