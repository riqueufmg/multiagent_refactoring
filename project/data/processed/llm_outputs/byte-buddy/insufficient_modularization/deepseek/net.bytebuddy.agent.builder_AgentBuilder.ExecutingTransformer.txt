    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ExecutingTransformer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (32) and a large lines-of-code count (484), indicating a large and complex structure that could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity. The lack of methods (0) coupled with many fields suggests a monolithic data-holding structure that might be better split into smaller, more focused classes."
