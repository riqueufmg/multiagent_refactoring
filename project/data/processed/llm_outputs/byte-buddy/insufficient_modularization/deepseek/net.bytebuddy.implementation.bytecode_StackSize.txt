    "justification": "The class has 111 lines of code (loc), 9 methods (nom), and weighted method complexity of 21 (wmc), indicating substantial implementation complexity. Despite having only 1 field (nof), the relatively high lack of cohesion (lcom=0.444) suggests methods may not be sufficiently grouped by responsibility, and the size and complexity could be reduced by further decomposition."
