    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ShiftLeft",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low size (40 LOC, 3 methods) and low complexity (WMC 3, 0 dependencies beyond two external references). The LCOM value (0.67) indicates moderate cohesion, but the limited scope and minimal methods do not suggest a clear opportunity for further decomposition that would reduce size or complexity."
