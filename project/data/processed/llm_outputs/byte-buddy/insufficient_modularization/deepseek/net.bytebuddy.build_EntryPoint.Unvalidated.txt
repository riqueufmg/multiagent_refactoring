    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=0), resulting in minimal implementation complexity (wmc=0, lcom=-1). Its size (loc=35) is small, and it has limited responsibilities with only 4 dependencies. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce complexity or size."
