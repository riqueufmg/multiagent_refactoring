    "justification": "Class with 167 lines of code (high loc) contains 4 fields but 0 methods (nom=0), indicating low cohesion and high implementation complexity. Absence of methods suggests all behavior is either in constructors, initializers, or inherited, and lack of decomposition is evident from high loc relative to zero method count."
