    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess.ForBridgeTarget",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal size (loc=23) and complexity (nom=0, nopf=0, wmc=0). It lacks methods and constructors, indicating no internal procedural logic to decompose. The presence of a single field (nof=1) and zero dependencies on other classes in the same package suggests it is already a minimal, cohesive unit."
