    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.OfType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only two fields (nof=2), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The lines of code (loc=73) might be due to comments or initializers, but without methods, further decomposition is unlikely to reduce complexity or size."
