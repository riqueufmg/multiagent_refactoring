    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ClassDumpAction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 fields (nof=8) and 114 lines of code (loc=114) with 0 methods (nom=0), indicating it may be handling multiple responsibilities through complex field usage and initialization code instead of decomposed behavior. The high field count relative to zero methods suggests insufficient decomposition of functionality."
