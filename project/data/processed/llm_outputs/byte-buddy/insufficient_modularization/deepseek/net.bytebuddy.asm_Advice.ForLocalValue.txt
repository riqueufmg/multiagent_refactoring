    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForLocalValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), with only 5 fields. While loc=78, the absence of methods and low field count suggests the class is already minimal; further decomposition would not reduce complexity and is unlikely to significantly reduce size."
