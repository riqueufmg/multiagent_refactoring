    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has an extremely high number of fields (263) relative to its methods (9) and lines of code (276). This indicates that the class is likely doing too much by holding a large number of attributes, and further decomposition could be performed to group related fields into separate classes, reducing the class size and complexity."
