    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.ForJnaPosixEnvironment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high complexity with 391 lines of code (loc) and 18 fields (nof), indicating it likely handles multiple responsibilities. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) suggests procedural-style code within the class, which violates modularization principles. High field count relative to methods suggests insufficient decomposition into smaller, focused classes."
