    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner.IsAssignableToVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits high complexity with 336 lines of code (loc) and 5 fields (nof), yet has zero methods (nom, nopm) and weighted methods (wmc=0), indicating a monolithic structure with likely dense, non-decomposed logic."
