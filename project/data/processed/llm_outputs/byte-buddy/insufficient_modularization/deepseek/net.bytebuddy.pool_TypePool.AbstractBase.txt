    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 72 lines of code (loc=72) but only one field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0). This high line count relative to the number of members suggests that the class may contain complex initializations, annotations, or code that could be decomposed into separate methods or classes to reduce size and complexity."
