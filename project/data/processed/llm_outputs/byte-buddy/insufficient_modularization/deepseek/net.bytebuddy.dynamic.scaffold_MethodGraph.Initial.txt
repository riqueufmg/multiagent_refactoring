    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 0 methods (nom=0) but 66 lines of code (loc=66), indicating significant implementation complexity without proper method decomposition. A class with this many lines of code and no methods suggests all logic is inline in constructors or initializers, violating modular design principles."
