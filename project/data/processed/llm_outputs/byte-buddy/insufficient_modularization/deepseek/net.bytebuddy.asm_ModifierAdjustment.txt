    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ModifierAdjustment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 349 lines of code and 23 methods, indicating a large size. The lack of cohesion (LCOM = 0.52) suggests that the class may have multiple responsibilities, as methods are not strongly related to all fields. This combination of high size and moderate lack of cohesion suggests that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and complexity."
