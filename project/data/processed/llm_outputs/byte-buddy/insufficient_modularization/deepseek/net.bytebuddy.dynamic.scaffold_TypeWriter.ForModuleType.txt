    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 99 lines of code (loc=99) but no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating a lack of internal modularization. This suggests the class contains code that could be decomposed into methods or smaller classes to reduce size and improve structure."
