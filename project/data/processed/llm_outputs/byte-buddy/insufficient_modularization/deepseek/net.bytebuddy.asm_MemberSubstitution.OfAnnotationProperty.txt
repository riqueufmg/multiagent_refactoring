    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfAnnotationProperty",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) but 57 lines of code (loc=57), indicating that all code exists in class-level or field-level constructs rather than being decomposed into methods. With 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods, the implementation complexity is concentrated in non-method constructs, suggesting insufficient functional decomposition."
