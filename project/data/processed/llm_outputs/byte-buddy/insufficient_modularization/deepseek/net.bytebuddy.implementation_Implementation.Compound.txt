{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Compound",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 138 lines of code and implements 0 methods, indicating a large monolithic structure without functional decomposition. The presence of multiple dependencies (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation, ByteCodeAppender) within a single class suggests it aggregates responsibilities that could be separated into distinct modules."
