    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldRegistry.Compiled",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high lines-of-code (LOC=82) relative to its functionality (0 methods, 0 constructors), and it lacks any methods or constructors, suggesting it may be a large data container or have complex initialization that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or components."
