    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForAnnotationProperty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), indicating low implementation complexity. Although the lines of code (loc=51) are moderately high, the absence of methods suggests the class is likely a simple data holder or annotation container, and further decomposition is unlikely to significantly reduce size or complexity."
