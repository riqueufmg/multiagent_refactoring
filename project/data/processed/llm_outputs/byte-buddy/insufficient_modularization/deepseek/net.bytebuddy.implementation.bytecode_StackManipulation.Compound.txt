    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 0 constructors (nc=0), and 0 weighted methods (wmc=0). With 52 lines of code (loc), the class is small and shows no signs of high implementation complexity or large size that would warrant further decomposition. The lack of methods and minimal fields suggests it is already sufficiently modularized."
