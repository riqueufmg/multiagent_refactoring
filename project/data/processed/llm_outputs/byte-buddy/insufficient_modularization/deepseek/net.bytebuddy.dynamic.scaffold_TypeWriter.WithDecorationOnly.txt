    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithDecorationOnly",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 123 lines of code (high size) and no methods (nom=0), indicating that all functionality is placed in initializers or field declarations without modularization. This, along with 5 fields and 15 dependencies, suggests the class is doing too much and could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and complexity."
