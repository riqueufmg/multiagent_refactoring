    "justification": "The class has only 1 field, 0 methods, and 34 lines of code, indicating minimal size and complexity. With zero methods and a single field, there is insufficient internal structure to warrant further decomposition. The low metrics (nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0, loc=34) suggest the class is already highly focused and minimal."
