    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits very high field count (nof=263) relative to its method count (nom=9) and functionality, with disproportionately large size (loc=276) and weighted method complexity (wmc=42). This suggests it aggregates multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
