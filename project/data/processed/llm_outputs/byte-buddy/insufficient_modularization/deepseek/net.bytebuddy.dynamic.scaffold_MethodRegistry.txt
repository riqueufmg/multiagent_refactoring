{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 33 fields (nof=33) and 776 lines of code (loc=776) with only 3 methods (nom=3), indicating excessive state and complexity concentrated in a single class. The high field count relative to methods suggests poor separation of concerns, and the substantial code volume exceeds typical class size thresholds, signaling that decomposition could reduce implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
