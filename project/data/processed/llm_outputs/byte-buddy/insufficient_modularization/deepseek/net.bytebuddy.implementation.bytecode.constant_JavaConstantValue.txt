    "justification": "The class has low method count (nom=2) and low weighted method complexity (wmc=2) with minimal field count (nof=1), which suggests focused functionality. The lines of code (loc=68) are moderate, and the class demonstrates high cohesion (lcom=0.0) with no immediate indicators that further decomposition would reduce complexity or size meaningfully."
