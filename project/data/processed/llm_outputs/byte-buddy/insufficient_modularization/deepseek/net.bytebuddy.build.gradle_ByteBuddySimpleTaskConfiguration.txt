    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2) and 2 fields (nof=2), minimal weighted methods (wmc=3), and small size (loc=49). High LCOM (1.0) suggests methods operate on disjoint fields, which is acceptable for configuration classes where methods handle separate concerns. No evidence that further decomposition would reduce complexity or size meaningfully."
