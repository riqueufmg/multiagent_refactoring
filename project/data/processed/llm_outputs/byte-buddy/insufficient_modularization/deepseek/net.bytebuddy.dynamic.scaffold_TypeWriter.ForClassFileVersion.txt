    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForClassFileVersion",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high size (147 LOC) and low method count (0), with only 1 field and -1.0 LCOM indicating possible procedural code without proper method decomposition. The significant LOC without corresponding method structure suggests the class may contain logic that could be broken down into smaller, more focused methods."
