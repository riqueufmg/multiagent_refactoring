    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 34 LOC, 3 fields, and 0 methods, indicating minimal size and complexity. There are no signs of multiple responsibilities or complex logic that would warrant further decomposition. The lack of methods and low field count suggest the class is already appropriately modularized for its purpose."
