    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), and low weighted method complexity (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. While the lines of code (loc=479) are relatively high, this is likely due to verbose declarations, annotations, or constants rather than complex logic requiring decomposition. The lack of methods and low field count suggests the class is already focused on a single responsibility as an abstract base definition."
