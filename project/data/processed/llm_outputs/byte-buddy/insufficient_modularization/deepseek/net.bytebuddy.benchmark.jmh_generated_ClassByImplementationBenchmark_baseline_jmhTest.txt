    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_baseline_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 263 fields (nof=263), 9 methods (nom=9), 276 lines of code (loc=276), and a weighted method complexity of 42 (wmc=42). This extremely high number of fields combined with moderate method count and complexity indicates the class manages excessive responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
