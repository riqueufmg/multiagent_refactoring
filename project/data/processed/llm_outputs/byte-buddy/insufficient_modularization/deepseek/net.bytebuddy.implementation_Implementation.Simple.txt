    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 152 lines of code (loc) and 0 methods (nom, wmc) but 6 fields (nof). This high line count with no methods indicates that the class likely contains complex initializations or static blocks that could be decomposed into separate classes or methods to reduce size and complexity."
