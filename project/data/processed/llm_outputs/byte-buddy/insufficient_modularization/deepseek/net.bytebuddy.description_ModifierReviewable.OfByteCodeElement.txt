    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0) and zero fields (nof=0), indicating no internal functionality to decompose. With no complexity in terms of weighted methods (wmc=0) or cohesion issues (lcom=-1.0), and minimal size (loc=45) without behavioral elements, further decomposition would not reduce complexity or size."
