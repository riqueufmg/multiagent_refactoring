    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only two fields (nof=2), resulting in low complexity (wmc=0). Although the lines of code (loc=39) are moderate, the absence of methods suggests that the class is already simple and further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity significantly."
