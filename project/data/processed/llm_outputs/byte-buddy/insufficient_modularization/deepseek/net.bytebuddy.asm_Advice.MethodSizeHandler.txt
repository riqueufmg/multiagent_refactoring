    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.MethodSizeHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 333 lines of code (loc) and 11 fields (nof), indicating a large size without any methods (nom=0) to organize the complexity. Such a high loc with zero methods suggests that the class is handling multiple responsibilities within its structure, making it a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and improve modularity."
