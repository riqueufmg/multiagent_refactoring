    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields, no methods, and 69 lines of code, which does not indicate excessive size or complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0) and low field count (nof=3) suggest it is already focused and not a candidate for further decomposition based solely on the provided metrics."
