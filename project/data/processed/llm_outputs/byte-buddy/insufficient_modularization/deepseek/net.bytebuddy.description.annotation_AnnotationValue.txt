    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a very high number of fields (42) and lines of code (2457) while exhibiting low functional cohesion, as indicated by a negative LCOM value (-1.0). This suggests the class aggregates multiple concerns that could be separated. Furthermore, the presence of numerous inner classes in the dependencies list implies the class has already been partially decomposed into supporting classes, indicating an ongoing need for further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
