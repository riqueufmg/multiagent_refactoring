    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.InMemory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) but 143 lines of code (loc=143), indicating significant implementation complexity without modularization into methods. The single non-static field (nof=1) and lack of method decomposition suggests the class contains monolithic code that could be broken down."
