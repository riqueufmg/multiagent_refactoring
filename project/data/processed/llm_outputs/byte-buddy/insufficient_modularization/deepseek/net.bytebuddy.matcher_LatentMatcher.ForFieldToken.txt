    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher.ForFieldToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted method count (wmc=0), indicating no implementation complexity to reduce via decomposition. While the lines of code (loc=44) are relatively high for a class with only two fields, this may be due to annotations, comments, or formatting, which do not warrant further decomposition. The class has minimal dependencies and no fan-in/fan-out, suggesting it is already a focused unit."
