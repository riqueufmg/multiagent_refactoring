    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForRegularInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only one field (nof=1), indicating low complexity (wmc=0). The lines of code (loc=47) are moderate, but the absence of methods suggests minimal behavior to decompose. Dependencies (5) are not excessive for a class with a single field, and further decomposition would not significantly reduce size or complexity."
