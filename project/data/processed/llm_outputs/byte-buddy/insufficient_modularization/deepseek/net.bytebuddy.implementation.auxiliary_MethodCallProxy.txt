    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.MethodCallProxy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 279 lines of code and 12 fields, indicating significant size and state. It also has 6 methods with a total WMC of 9 and an average method length of approximately 46.5 lines, suggesting high implementation complexity per method. Despite a cohesion metric of 0.0, the class could be decomposed further to reduce its size and complexity."
