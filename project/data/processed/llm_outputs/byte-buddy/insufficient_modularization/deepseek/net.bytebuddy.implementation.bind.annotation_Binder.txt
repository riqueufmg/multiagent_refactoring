    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits high implementation complexity with 46 external dependencies, including numerous inner classes (e.g., Binder.Implicit, Binder.ForImplicitType, Binder.MethodLocator), indicating multiple responsibilities that could be separated. While the class has a low LOC (64) and WMC (3), the extensive dependency list suggests insufficient decomposition of its functionality into more focused, cohesive units."
