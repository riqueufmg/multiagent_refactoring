    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (nom=3), low lines of code (loc=26), low weighted method complexity (wmc=3), and perfect cohesion (lcom=0.0). These metrics indicate the class is already small and focused, making further decomposition unlikely to reduce size or complexity."
