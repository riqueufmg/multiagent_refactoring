    "justification": "The class has only 82 lines of code (loc), 1 field (nof), and 8 methods with a weighted method complexity (wmc) of 8, indicating a small and simple implementation. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.375) suggests high cohesion, and the minimal dependencies (1) further indicate focused responsibility. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
