    "justification": "The class has 96 lines of code (loc=96) but no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating code that is not encapsulated into methods or fields, which could be decomposed to reduce size or complexity. Dependencies on multiple external classes (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription) suggest potential handling of multiple concerns that might be separated."
