    "justification": "Class has 114 lines of code (large size) with 2 fields and 0 methods, indicating high implementation complexity within a single class that lacks functional decomposition. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests no method cohesion analysis is possible due to zero methods, further highlighting insufficient modularization."
