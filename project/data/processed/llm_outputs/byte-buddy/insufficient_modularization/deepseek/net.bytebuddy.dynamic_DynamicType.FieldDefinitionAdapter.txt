    "justification": "Class has 39 lines of code (loc) with 0 methods (nom) and 1 field (nof), indicating a simple structure that could be merged into its parent class or eliminated. The lack of methods (nom=0, wmc=0) suggests it does not provide distinct modular functionality, and the single field could be managed elsewhere without separate abstraction."
