    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.ForLegacyVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and minimal lines of code (loc=27), with no constructors (nc=0) and only two fields (nof=2). This indicates very low complexity and minimal size, making further decomposition unnecessary and not beneficial."
