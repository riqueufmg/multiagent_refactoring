    "justification": "Class exhibits low complexity (WMC=0, NC=0, NOM=0, NOF=4) and minimal dependencies. Despite moderate LOC (70), lack of methods or constructors suggests limited implementation complexity. No indicators of insufficient decomposition such as high method count, cyclomatic complexity, or excessive responsibilities that could be modularized further."
