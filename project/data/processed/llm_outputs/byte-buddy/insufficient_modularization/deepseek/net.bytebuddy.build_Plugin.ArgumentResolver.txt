    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (nof=8) and substantial lines of code (loc=229) while exhibiting zero methods (nom=0), indicating it may be a large data container or complex structure lacking behavioral abstraction. This suggests the class could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive units to reduce size and complexity."
