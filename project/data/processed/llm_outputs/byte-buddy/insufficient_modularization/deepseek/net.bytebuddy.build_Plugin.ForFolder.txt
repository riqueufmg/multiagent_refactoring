    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForFolder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 132 lines of code (high size) but only 2 fields and 0 methods, indicating a lack of method decomposition and potential high complexity in the class body (e.g., initializers or constructors). This suggests that the class could be broken down into methods or split into smaller classes to reduce its size and complexity."
