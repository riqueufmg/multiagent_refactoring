    "justification": "Class has low size (LOC=83, WMC=7, NOM=4) with minimal complexity and no excessive field count (NOF=3). LCOM=0.75 shows moderate but not problematic cohesion, and the class has no dependencies beyond its natural domain (StackManipulation and StackSize). No clear indicators for decomposition to reduce size or complexity."
