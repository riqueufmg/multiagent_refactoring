    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 50 lines of code (loc=50), indicating that its behavior is likely embedded in the class body or initializers rather than well-defined methods, and it has 2 fields (nof=2) with no cohesive operations, suggesting insufficient decomposition."
