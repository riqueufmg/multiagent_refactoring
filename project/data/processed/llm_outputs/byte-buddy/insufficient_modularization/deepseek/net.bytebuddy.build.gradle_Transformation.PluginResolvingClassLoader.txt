    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Transformation.PluginResolvingClassLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 70 lines of code (loc) and no methods (nom=0), suggesting a single large block of code without functional decomposition. The presence of two fields (nof=2) and no methods indicates that the class likely contains procedural code within a constructor or initializer that could be extracted into separate methods or classes."
