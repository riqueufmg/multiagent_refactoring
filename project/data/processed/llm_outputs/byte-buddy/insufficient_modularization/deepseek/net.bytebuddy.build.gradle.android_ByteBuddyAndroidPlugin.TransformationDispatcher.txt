    "justification": "Class has high LOC (150) without any methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating procedural code with no functional decomposition. High field count (nof=5) with negative LCOM (-1.0) suggests all fields are used together without method separation. Size exceeds typical single-responsibility thresholds without modularization benefits."
