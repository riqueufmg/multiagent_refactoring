    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.RecordComponentRegistry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class size is large (208 LOC) with high structural complexity (9 fields, 1 inner class). Methods are few (2) relative to fields, indicating a single class handling multiple responsibilities (data storage, registry logic). Low cohesion (LCOM = -1.0) and zero fan-in/fanout suggest the class is isolated and undertakes excessive internal functionality, which could be decomposed into smaller, focused classes."
