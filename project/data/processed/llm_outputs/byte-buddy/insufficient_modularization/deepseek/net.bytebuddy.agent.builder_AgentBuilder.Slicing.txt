    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Slicing",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 10 fields, 174 lines of code, and low cohesion (LCOM=-1). Despite having 0 methods, the significant field count and code volume indicate insufficient decomposition. The size suggests the class could benefit from splitting responsibilities into smaller, more focused classes."
