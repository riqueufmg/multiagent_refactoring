    "justification": "The class has 40 lines of code (loc) and 2 fields (nof) with no methods (nom=0), suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused components. The absence of methods (nom=0) and weighted methods per class (wmc=0) indicates the class may be performing operations inline that could be extracted into separate methods or classes."
