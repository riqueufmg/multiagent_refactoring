    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithProxy_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has an extremely high number of fields (263), which is a strong indicator that it could be decomposed into smaller classes to reduce its size and complexity. Although it has only 9 methods and 276 lines of code, the large number of fields suggests insufficient modularization."
