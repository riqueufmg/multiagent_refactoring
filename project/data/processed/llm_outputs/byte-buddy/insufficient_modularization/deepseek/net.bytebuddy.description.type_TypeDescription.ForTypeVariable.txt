    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForTypeVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0), and zero weighted methods per class (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity and state. Despite 54 lines of code (loc=54), the absence of methods and single field suggests that the class is already minimal and further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
