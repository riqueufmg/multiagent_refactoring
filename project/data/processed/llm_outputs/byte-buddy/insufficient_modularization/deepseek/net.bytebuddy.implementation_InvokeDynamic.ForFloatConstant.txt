    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForFloatConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 lines of code but only 1 field and 0 methods, indicating it might be performing multiple responsibilities without proper method decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0) despite having 28 LOC suggests procedural-style code or complex initialization that could be broken down into smaller, more focused methods or helper classes to reduce implementation complexity."
