    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero fields (nof=0, nopf=0), with minimal complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0). It depends on only one external type. Given these characteristics, the class is already minimal and cannot be decomposed further to reduce size or implementation complexity."
