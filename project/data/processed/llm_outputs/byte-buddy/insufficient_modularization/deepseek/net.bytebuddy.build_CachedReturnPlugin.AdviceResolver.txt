    "justification": "The class has 153 lines of code (loc), which is considered large for a class with no methods (nom=0) and only 6 fields (nof=6). The presence of 12 external dependencies indicates high coupling and potential for multiple responsibilities, suggesting it could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
