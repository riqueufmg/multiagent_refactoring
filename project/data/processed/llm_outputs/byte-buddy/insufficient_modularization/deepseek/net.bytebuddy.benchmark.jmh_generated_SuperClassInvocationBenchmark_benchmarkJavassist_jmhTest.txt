    "justification": "The class has an extremely high number of fields (nof=263) relative to its methods (nom=9) and lines of code (loc=276), indicating it aggregates excessive data or responsibilities. This large field set suggests the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
