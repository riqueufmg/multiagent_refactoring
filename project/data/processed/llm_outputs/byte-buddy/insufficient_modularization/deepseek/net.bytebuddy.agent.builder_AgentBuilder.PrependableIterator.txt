    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.PrependableIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and minimal fields (nof=2), indicating no implementation complexity to decompose. Low lines of code (loc=59) and lack of dependencies suggest no significant size or complexity reduction is possible through further decomposition."
