    "justification": "The class has high lines of code (loc=81) with no methods (nom=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3), indicating potential for size reduction. Dependencies on multiple external classes (e.g., AnnotationValue, MethodAttributeAppender, ByteCodeAppender) suggest multiple responsibilities that could be separated through decomposition."
