{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 514 lines of code (loc) but only 2 methods (nom), indicating extremely long and complex methods. It has 10 fields (nof) that are likely not cohesively used by the few methods, and the presence of multiple inner classes in dependencies suggests responsibility overload. The class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units."
