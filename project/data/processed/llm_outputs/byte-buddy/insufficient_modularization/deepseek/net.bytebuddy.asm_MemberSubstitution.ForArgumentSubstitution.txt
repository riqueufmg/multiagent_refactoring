    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForArgumentSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom, nopm) and 0 weighted methods (wmc) despite having 109 lines of code (loc) and 8 fields (nof). This indicates a high concentration of functionality within fields or initializations without proper behavioral abstraction, suggesting that a decomposition into smaller, focused classes could reduce size and complexity."
