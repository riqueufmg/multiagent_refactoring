    "justification": "Class size (loc: 111) and complexity (wmc: 3, nom: 3, nc: 9 including inner classes) are moderate. High cohesion (lcom: -1.0) and low coupling (fanin: 0, fanout: 0) suggest a well-encapsulated, single-responsibility unit. No clear decomposition opportunity that would reduce size or complexity without breaking cohesion."
