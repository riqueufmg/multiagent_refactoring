    "justification": "Class has only 40 lines of code and 3 methods with low complexity (WMC=3). The single field and limited method count indicate the class is already focused and of minimal size. No inner classes exist (nc=0) and dependencies are minimal. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
