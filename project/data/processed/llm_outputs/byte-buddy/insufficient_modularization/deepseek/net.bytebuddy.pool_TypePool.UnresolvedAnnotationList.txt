    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), and low lines of code (loc=25). The weighted method count is zero (wmc=0), indicating no implementation complexity. With only one dependency and no evidence of multiple responsibilities, further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity."
