    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Preprocessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 211 lines of code (loc), 11 fields (nof), and 0 methods (nom). The high number of fields and lines of code, combined with a lack of methods, suggests the class may be performing multiple responsibilities without decomposition. Further decomposition could reduce its size and complexity."
