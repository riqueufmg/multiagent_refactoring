    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Build",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 69 lines of code (loc=69) and 5 fields (nof=5) without any methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating a monolithic structure where data and behavior are not separated. The lack of methods suggests the class may be handling complex data aggregation that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
