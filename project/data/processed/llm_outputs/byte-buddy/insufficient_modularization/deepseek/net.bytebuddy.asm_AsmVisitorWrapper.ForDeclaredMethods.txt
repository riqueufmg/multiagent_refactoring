    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 240 lines of code (loc) and 11 fields (nof), yet lacks any methods (nom=0) or defined behavior, indicating it likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be separated. The absence of method definitions suggests internal complexity is concentrated in initializers or inherited functionality, which further decomposition could reduce."
