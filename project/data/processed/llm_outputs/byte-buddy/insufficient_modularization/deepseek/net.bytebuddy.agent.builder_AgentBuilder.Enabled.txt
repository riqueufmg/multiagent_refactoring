    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 89 lines of code (loc) but no methods (nom=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2). This disproportionally large size for a class with no methods suggests that the class may contain extensive initialization code or static blocks that could be decomposed into separate classes to reduce size and improve modularity."
