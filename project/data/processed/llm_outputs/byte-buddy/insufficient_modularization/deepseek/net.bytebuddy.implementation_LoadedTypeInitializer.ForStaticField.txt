    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer.ForStaticField",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods and 4 fields with 79 lines of code, indicating a potentially incomplete decomposition where logic may be embedded in field initializations or constructors not captured by method counts. The class shows high implementation complexity (loc) relative to its method count (nom=0, nopm=0), suggesting further decomposition could reduce complexity."
