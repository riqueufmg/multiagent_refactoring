    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 56 lines of code (loc) but zero methods (nom=0) and only one field (nof=1), indicating a lack of internal modularization. The high loc-to-method ratio suggests that the class may contain monolithic code or complex initializations that could be decomposed into smaller, focused methods or classes to reduce size and complexity."
