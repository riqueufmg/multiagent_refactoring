    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only three fields (nof=3), indicating low implementation complexity. The lines of code (loc=51) are moderate and could be due to formatting or annotations. There is no evidence from the metrics (wmc=0, lcom=-1, dit=0) that the class has multiple responsibilities or that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity significantly."
