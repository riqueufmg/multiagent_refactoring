    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassFilePostProcessor.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating no implementation complexity. The lines of code (loc=13) are minimal and likely consist of class declaration and possibly comments. The weighted method complexity (wmc=0) is zero, and lack of cohesion (lcom=-1) is not applicable. Therefore, the class is already minimal and further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
