    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.OfInstance",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating low implementation complexity. The lines of code (37) are moderate, but the absence of methods and low field count suggests the class is already minimal. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
