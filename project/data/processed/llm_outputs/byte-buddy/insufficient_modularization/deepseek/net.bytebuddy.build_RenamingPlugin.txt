    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RenamingPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 208 lines of code (loc) and 9 methods (nom), indicating a substantial size and implementation complexity. The lack of cohesion (lcom=0.5556) suggests the methods may be weakly related, and with 7 fields (nof), the class likely handles multiple responsibilities. This combination of moderate size, multiple methods, and low cohesion indicates potential for further decomposition to reduce complexity and improve modularity."
