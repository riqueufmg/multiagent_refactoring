    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.MethodCall",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only 3 fields, indicating low implementation complexity. Although the class has 66 lines of code, the absence of methods suggests that the size is likely due to annotations or formatting, and further decomposition is not warranted."
