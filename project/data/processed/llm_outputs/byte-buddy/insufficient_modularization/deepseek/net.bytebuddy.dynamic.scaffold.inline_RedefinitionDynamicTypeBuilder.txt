    "justification": "Class has low lines of code (62) and low weighted method count (4) indicating small size and low complexity. It has zero fields and only one public method, suggesting a focused responsibility. Low fan-in (0) and fan-out (0) metrics show minimal coupling. These factors do not indicate a need for further decomposition."
