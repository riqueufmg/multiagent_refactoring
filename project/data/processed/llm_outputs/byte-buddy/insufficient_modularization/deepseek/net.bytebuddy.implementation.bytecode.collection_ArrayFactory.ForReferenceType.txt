    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom: 0, nopm: 0) but 29 lines of code (loc: 29), indicating potential procedural code or initialization logic that could be decomposed. The presence of 3 dependencies suggests functionality that might be extracted into separate methods or classes to reduce implementation complexity."
