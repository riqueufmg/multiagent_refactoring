    "justification": "Class size (loc=170) is relatively high for a class with no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it likely contains substantial logic that could be decomposed. The presence of 2 fields (nof=2) without associated methods suggests these fields may be directly exposed or managed in an unmodularized way, potentially increasing complexity."
