    "justification": "The class is large (LOC: 430) and contains a high number of methods (nom: 12), suggesting it could be decomposed. The presence of inner classes in the dependencies list (e.g., ClassReloadingStrategy.BootstrapInjection, ClassReloadingStrategy.Strategy, ClassReloadingStrategy.ClassResettingTransformer, ClassReloadingStrategy.Dispatcher, ClassReloadingStrategy.Disabled) indicates that modularization has already been partially applied, but the main class still retains significant implementation complexity. Further decomposition of these inner responsibilities into separate, independent classes could reduce the main class's size and complexity."
