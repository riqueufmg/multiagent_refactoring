    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 1 field (nof=1). It has no internal branching or conditional logic (wmc=0) and low lines of code (loc=36), indicating it is already a focused, single-purpose unit. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
