{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.MethodPool",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 925 lines of code and 29 fields, which indicates excessive size and structural complexity for a single class. The high field count without corresponding methods suggests poor cohesion. The large size with zero methods indicates it likely handles multiple responsibilities that could be separated."
