    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.TypeVariableBoundList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low metrics indicating limited functionality: no methods (nom=0), no constructors (nc=0), minimal fields (nof=2), and small size (loc=34). This suggests the class is already highly focused, and further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
