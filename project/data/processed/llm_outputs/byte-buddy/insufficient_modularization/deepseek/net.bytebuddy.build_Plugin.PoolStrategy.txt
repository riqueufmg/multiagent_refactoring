    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 65 lines of code (loc) and 0 methods (nom), indicating it may contain inline or procedural code that could be decomposed into methods. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests no cohesive methods exist, further supporting the need for decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
