    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: no methods (nom=0), no public methods (nopm=0), and a small size (loc=79). It has only three fields and no dependencies, indicating it is already a focused, minimal unit. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce its size or complexity."
