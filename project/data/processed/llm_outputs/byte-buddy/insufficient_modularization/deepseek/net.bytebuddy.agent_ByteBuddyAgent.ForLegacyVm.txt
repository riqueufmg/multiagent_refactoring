    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.ForLegacyVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no fields (nof=0) and no methods (nom=0), resulting in zero implementation complexity (wmc=0). With no functional elements to decompose, further modularization is not applicable, and the size (loc=27) does not indicate excessive complexity that warrants decomposition."
