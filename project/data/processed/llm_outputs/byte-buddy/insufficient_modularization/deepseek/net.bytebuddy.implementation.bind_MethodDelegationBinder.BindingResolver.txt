    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods but 161 lines of code (LOC), indicating a large amount of code potentially handling multiple responsibilities in a non-modular way, such as complex initializations or inline logic. Additionally, it has 6 fields (nof) with no methods to encapsulate or manage them, suggesting insufficient decomposition into focused, cohesive units."
