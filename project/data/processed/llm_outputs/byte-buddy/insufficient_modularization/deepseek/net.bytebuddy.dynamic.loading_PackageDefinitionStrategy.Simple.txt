    "justification": "The class has 131 lines of code (loc) and 7 fields (nof) but no methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0), indicating high size and potential initialization complexity without behavioral decomposition, which suggests it could be broken down into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
