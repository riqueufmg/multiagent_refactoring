    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), a single field (nof=1), and low size (loc=36). It shows no internal coupling issues (lcom=-1.0) and no external dependencies. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
