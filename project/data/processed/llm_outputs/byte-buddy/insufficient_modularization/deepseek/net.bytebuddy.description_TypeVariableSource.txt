    "justification": "The class has moderate size (118 LOC) and low complexity (WMC=7). LCOM of -1.0 indicates high cohesion, and the presence of inner classes (nc=3) suggests some decomposition. With only one field and 7 methods, the class appears to have a focused responsibility, and further decomposition may not significantly reduce size or complexity."
