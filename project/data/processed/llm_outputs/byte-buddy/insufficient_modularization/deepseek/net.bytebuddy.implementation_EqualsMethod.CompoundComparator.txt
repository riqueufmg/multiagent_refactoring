    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.CompoundComparator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 43 lines of code (loc) but only 0 methods (nom) and 1 field (nof), indicating disproportionate size-to-functionality ratio. With no methods and minimal fields, the 43 lines of code suggest potential monolithic initialization or configuration logic that could be decomposed into separate helper methods or classes. Additionally, the LCOM value of -1.0 suggests no cohesion between non-existent methods, further indicating the class may be under-decomposed."
