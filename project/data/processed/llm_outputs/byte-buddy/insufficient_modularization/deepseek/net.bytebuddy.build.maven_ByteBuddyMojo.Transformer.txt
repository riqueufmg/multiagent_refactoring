    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 110 lines of code (loc) and 0 methods (nom), indicating a large monolithic structure without behavioral decomposition. High loc with no methods suggests the class is likely handling multiple responsibilities or complex initialization internally, which could be broken down into smaller, focused units to reduce size and complexity."
