    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and no methods (nom=0), indicating low implementation complexity. While the lines of code (loc=97) are moderately high, the absence of methods and minimal fields suggests the class is likely a simple data holder or configuration class. Further decomposition is unlikely to significantly reduce complexity or size, as there is no behavioral complexity to modularize and the size may be due to initializations or annotations rather than multiple responsibilities."
