    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0) indicating minimal internal complexity, 0 weighted methods per class (wmc=0) showing no method complexity, and 76 lines of code (loc) which is moderate. With no internal structure to decompose, further modularization would not reduce size or complexity."
