    "justification": "Class has 263 fields (nof=263) and 276 lines of code (loc=276), indicating excessive size and implementation complexity that suggests insufficient decomposition. The weighted method complexity (wmc=42) for only 9 methods (nom=9) further indicates high per-method complexity. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) confirms this complexity exists within the class itself."
