    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits high implementation complexity (WMC=23) and substantial size (LOC=235) with 6 methods and 7 fields. Its lack of cohesion (LCOM=0.6667) indicates the methods may not share a single responsibility, suggesting further decomposition could reduce complexity and improve modularity."
