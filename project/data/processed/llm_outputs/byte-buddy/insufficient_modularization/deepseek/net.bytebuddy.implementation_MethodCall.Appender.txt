    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only six fields (nof=6), resulting in low implementation complexity. The lines of code (loc=84) and lack of methods suggest no significant decomposition opportunity exists to reduce size or complexity."
