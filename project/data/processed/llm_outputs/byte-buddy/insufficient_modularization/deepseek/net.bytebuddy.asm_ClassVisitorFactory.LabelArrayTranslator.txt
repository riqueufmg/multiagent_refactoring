    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.LabelArrayTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only three fields (nof=3), indicating minimal behavioral complexity. The lines of code (loc=65) are moderate, and complexity metrics (wmc=0, dit=1) are low, suggesting no significant need for further decomposition to reduce size or complexity."
