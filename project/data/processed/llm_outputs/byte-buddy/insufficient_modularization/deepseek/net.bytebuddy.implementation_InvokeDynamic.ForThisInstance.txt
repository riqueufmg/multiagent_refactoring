    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForThisInstance",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and no constructors (nc=0), resulting in zero implementation complexity (wmc=0). The size (loc=34) is minimal, and the single field and lack of cohesive methods (lcom=-1.0) indicate no meaningful behavior to decompose. Dependencies are few and standard for a simple type wrapper."
