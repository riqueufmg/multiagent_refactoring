    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0), indicating minimal behavioral complexity. Although the lines of code (loc=138) are moderately high, the absence of methods suggests the size is primarily due to declarative elements (field declarations, annotations, etc.). Further decomposition is unlikely to reduce complexity, and the class exhibits low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0)."
