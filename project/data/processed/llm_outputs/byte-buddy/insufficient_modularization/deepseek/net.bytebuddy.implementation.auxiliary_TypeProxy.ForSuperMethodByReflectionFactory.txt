    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy.ForSuperMethodByReflectionFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 4 fields (nof=4) with 41 lines of code (loc=41). Its weighted method complexity is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The absence of methods and low complexity suggests no further decomposition is warranted to reduce size or complexity."
