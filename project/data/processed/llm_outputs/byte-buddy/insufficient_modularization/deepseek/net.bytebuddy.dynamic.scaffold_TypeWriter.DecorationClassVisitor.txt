    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 59 lines of code with 4 fields and 0 methods, indicating it may contain multiple responsibilities or complex field initialization that could be extracted. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests no cohesive methods exist, but the 4 dependencies and significant code size (59 LOC) without corresponding methods suggest insufficient decomposition."
