    "justification": "Class size metrics exceed typical modularization thresholds: 21 fields (nof=21), 379 lines of code (loc=379), and 17 methods (nom=17). High field count suggests multiple responsibilities could be encapsulated in separate classes. Moderate method count combined with substantial code volume indicates implementation complexity that could benefit from decomposition."
