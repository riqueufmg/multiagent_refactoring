    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 305 lines of code (loc) and 9 fields (nof) with no methods (nom=0) or constructors (nc=0), indicating a large data structure that could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity. The high field count relative to functionality suggests grouping related fields into separate classes could improve modularity."
