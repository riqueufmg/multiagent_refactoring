    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0), low complexity (wmc=0), and only two fields (nof=2). While the lines of code (loc=46) are moderate, the absence of methods and low complexity indicators do not suggest that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
