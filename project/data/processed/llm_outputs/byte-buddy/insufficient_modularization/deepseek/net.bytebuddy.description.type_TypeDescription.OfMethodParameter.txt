    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (wmc=0) and only 3 fields, indicating low implementation complexity. The 41 lines of code likely include declarations and annotations, but without methods, there is minimal functionality to decompose. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
