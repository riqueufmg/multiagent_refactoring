    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.WithTypePoolCache",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 127 lines of code (loc) but 0 methods (nom) and no public methods (nopm), suggesting it may primarily consist of field declarations or initialization logic without distinct behavioral responsibilities. With 4 fields (nof) and dependencies on 4 external classes, it could be handling multiple concerns like caching, pooling, or configuration that might be separable into smaller, more focused classes."
