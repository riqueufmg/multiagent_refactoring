    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForInstance",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 4 fields (nof=4) with 56 lines of code (loc=56), indicating minimal functional complexity and implementation size. No methods exist to decompose, and the absence of weighted methods (wmc=0) suggests low internal complexity. While dependent on 5 external classes, these dependencies do not by themselves justify decomposition without evidence of high internal complexity or size."
