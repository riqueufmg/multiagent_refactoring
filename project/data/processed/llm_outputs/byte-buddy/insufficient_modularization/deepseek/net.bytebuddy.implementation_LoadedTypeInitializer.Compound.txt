    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods and only two fields, indicating low complexity and a small functional footprint. The lines of code, while relatively high, are likely due to annotations and declarations that do not increase functional complexity, and further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
