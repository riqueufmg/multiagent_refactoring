    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfDynamicInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3). The WMC is 0, indicating no method complexity. The LOC of 51 may be due to annotations or initializers, but without methods, there is no behavior to decompose. The class does not show signs of high complexity or multiple responsibilities that would require further modularization."
