    "justification": "The class has 135 lines of code (loc) and 7 fields (nof) but 0 methods (nom), indicating a high data-to-behavior ratio typical of insufficient decomposition. The negative LCOM (-1.0) suggests no cohesive method grouping exists, implying the class may be acting as a monolithic container that could be split into smaller, more focused classes."
