    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 2 fields (nof=2) with 46 lines of code (loc=46), indicating minimal implementation complexity. Weighted methods per class is 0 (wmc=0), and lack of cohesion is -1 (lcom=-1), suggesting no method complexity or cohesion issues. The dependencies are limited to three type references. No evidence of excessive responsibilities or decomposable logic."
