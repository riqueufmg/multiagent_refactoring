    "justification": "The class has 252 lines of code (loc) and 14 fields (nof), which indicates a large class with many attributes. Despite having 0 methods (nom), the high line count suggests that the class may contain substantial initialization or other code that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
