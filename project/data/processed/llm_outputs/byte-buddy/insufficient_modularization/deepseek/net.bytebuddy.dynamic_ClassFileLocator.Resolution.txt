    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and minimal fields (nof=2, nopf=0) with low lines of code (loc=71). It shows no internal complexity (wmc=0, nc=0) and no method-level cohesion concerns (lcom=-1). With no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0 except for a single plugin), the class is already minimal and further decomposition is not indicated."
