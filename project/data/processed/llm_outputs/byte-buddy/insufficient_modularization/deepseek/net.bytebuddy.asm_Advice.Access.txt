    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating minimal functionality. The lines of code (loc=26) are relatively low, and the weighted method complexity (wmc=0) is zero. With no methods or fields, there is no basis for further decomposition to reduce complexity or size."
