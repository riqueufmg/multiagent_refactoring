    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.MultipleParentClassLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high lines of code (325 loc) and weighted method complexity (14 wmc) for its method count (8 nom) and field count (6 nof), with moderate cohesion (0.375 lcom). The combination suggests multiple responsibilities or complex implementation that could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
