    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 45 lines of code but zero fields and zero methods, indicating it may contain inline logic that could be extracted into separate methods or classes. The presence of code (LOC=45) without corresponding methods (nom=0) or fields (nof=0) suggests insufficient decomposition of responsibilities."
