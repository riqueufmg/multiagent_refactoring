    "justification": "Class has 369 lines of code and 8 methods, indicating a large and potentially complex unit. It contains 3 inner classes (LookupKey, Sort, StorageKey), suggesting the main class has multiple responsibilities that are not fully decomposed. The existence of inner classes hints that further decomposition into separate classes could reduce size and complexity."
