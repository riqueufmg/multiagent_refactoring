    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy.Trivial",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (WMC=0, nom=0) and only two fields (nof=2), indicating low implementation complexity. Although LOC is 69, the absence of methods and minimal fields suggest the class is already sufficiently modularized. Further decomposition would not significantly reduce size or complexity."
