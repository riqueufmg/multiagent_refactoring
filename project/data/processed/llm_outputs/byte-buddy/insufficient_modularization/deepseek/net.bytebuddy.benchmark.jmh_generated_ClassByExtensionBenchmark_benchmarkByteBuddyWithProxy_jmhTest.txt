    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddyWithProxy_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has an extremely high number of fields (263) while having only 9 methods and 276 lines of code. This indicates that the class may be holding too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition to group related fields into separate classes, reducing size and complexity."
