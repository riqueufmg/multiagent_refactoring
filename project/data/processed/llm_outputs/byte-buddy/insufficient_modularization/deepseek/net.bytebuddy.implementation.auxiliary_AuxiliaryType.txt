    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 classes in one file (nc=7) and 109 lines of code. The high number of inner classes indicates that the class might be insufficiently modularized, and further decomposition by moving inner classes to separate top-level classes could reduce its size and complexity."
