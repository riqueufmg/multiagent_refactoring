    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 65 lines of code (loc) but defines no methods (nom=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2). This discrepancy suggests that the class may contain complex initialization logic or multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
