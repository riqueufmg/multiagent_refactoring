    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), indicating minimal functional complexity. While LOC is 92, this could be attributed to non-code elements such as extensive comments or annotations. With no evidence of high implementation complexity or multiple responsibilities, further decomposition is not warranted."
