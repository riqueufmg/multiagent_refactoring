    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation.Size",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 57 lines of code (loc=57) and zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0) but 3 fields (nof=3), indicating it is a data structure or simple type that could be decomposed to reduce size. The presence of a dependency on HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin suggests it may be a data class that could be split into smaller, more focused components."
