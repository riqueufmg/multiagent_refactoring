    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.DispatchingVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and low complexity (wmc=0), with moderate size (loc=60). The lack of methods and low complexity indicates that the class is already sufficiently modularized, and further decomposition is unlikely to reduce implementation complexity or size substantially."
