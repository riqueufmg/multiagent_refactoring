    "justification": "Class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 1 field (nof=1), indicating minimal behavior. Complexity (wmc=0) is low. Although LOC is 78, the lack of methods suggests that the class is likely a simple data holder or definition, and insufficient modularization is not evident based on the given metrics."
