    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Redefining",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 174 lines of code (loc) and 0 methods (nom), indicating a high code volume without modularization into methods. This suggests the class likely contains complex initialization code or multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
