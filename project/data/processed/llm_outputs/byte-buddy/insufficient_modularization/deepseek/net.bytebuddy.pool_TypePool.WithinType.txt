    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.WithinType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity (0 methods, 0 constructors, 2 fields, 46 lines of code) and no behavioral logic (WMC=0, no methods), indicating it is already a small, focused unit. Further decomposition is not warranted as it would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
