    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.AnnotationStripper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted methods (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With only one field (nof=1) and moderate lines of code (loc=78), the class appears cohesive and further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity."
