    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has an extremely high number of fields (nof=263) relative to its number of methods (nom=9) and lines of code (loc=276), indicating it is likely handling multiple responsibilities or contains substantial state that could be grouped into separate classes. This high field count combined with a weighted method complexity (wmc=42) suggests significant implementation complexity that could be reduced through decomposition."
