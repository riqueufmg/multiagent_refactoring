    "justification": "The class has 114 lines of code (loc) but only 1 field (nof) and 0 methods (nom). This high code-to-members ratio suggests the class likely contains substantial procedural code or complex inline implementations that could be decomposed into separate methods or classes to reduce size and complexity."
