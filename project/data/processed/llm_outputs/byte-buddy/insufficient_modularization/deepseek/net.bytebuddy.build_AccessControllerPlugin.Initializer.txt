    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin.Initializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High LOC (103) and presence of 3 fields indicate substantial implementation complexity concentrated in a single class. The lack of methods (0) suggests the class may be handling multiple responsibilities through field initializations or other constructs, and further decomposition could reduce its size and complexity."
