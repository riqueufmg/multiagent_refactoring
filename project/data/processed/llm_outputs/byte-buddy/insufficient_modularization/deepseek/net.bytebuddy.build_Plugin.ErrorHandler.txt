    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ErrorHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 319 lines of code (loc) with only 1 field (nof) and 0 methods (nom), indicating a large codebase with low structural decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0) and weighted methods per class (wmc=0) suggests minimal behavioral complexity, yet the high line count implies excessive size or embedded complexity that could be reduced by further decomposition."
