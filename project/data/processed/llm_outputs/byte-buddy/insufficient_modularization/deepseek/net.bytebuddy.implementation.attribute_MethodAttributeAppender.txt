    "justification": "The class has high lines of code (loc=338) and contains multiple inner classes (nc=8), indicating a large size and complexity that could be reduced by further decomposition. The outer class has only one method (nom=1) and six fields (nof=6), suggesting it primarily acts as a container for inner classes, which could be moved out to reduce implementation complexity and size."
