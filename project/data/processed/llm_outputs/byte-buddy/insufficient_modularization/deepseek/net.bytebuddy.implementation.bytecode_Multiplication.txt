    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Multiplication",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=3, LOC=46) and a small number of methods (nom=3) and fields (nof=2). The lack of cohesion (LCOM=0.67) is moderate but does not strongly indicate insufficient decomposition for a class of this size and responsibility. The class appears focused on a single, narrow functionality, suggesting adequate modularization."
