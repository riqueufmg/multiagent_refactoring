{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 17 fields (nof=17) and 339 lines of code (loc=339), indicating high complexity and size. The class implements multiple responsibilities including configuration handling, bytecode generation, and delegation logic, which could be decomposed into separate classes. The presence of two nested classes (nc=2) suggests partial decomposition but insufficient overall modularization. High field count combined with 10 methods (nom=10) suggests multiple concerns are intertwined."
