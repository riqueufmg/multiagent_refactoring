    "justification": "The class has a high lines of code (loc=141) and number of fields (nof=8) while having no methods (nom=0). This suggests a concentration of responsibilities, such as complex data aggregation or initialization logic, that could be decomposed into separate classes or helper methods to reduce size and complexity."
