    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy.InjectionDispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) but 73 lines of code (loc=73) and 3 fields (nof=3), indicating it contains significant code without behavioral decomposition. The lack of methods suggests the class may be handling multiple responsibilities through procedural code or complex initialization that could be modularized into separate methods or classes."
