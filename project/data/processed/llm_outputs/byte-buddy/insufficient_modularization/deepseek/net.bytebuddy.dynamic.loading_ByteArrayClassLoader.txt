    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (32) and lines of code (1127), indicating large size. Additionally, it defines multiple inner classes (e.g., PersistenceHandler, ForLegacyVm) which suggests that the class has multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed to reduce complexity and size."
