    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only one field (nof=1), indicating low implementation complexity and minimal functionality. With a weighted method count (wmc) of 0 and lines of code (loc=57) that are likely due to declarations or comments rather than complex logic, there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities that would necessitate further decomposition."
