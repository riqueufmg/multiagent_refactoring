    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom: 0) and zero weighted methods per class (wmc: 0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The lines of code (loc: 111) are for field definitions and initializations, with dependencies on four classes for type usage, but no behavioral elements to justify further decomposition."
