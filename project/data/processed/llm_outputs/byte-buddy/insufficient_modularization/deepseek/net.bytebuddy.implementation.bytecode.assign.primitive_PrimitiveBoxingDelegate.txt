    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 130 lines of code (loc) with only 3 methods (nom), indicating long and potentially complex methods (average 43 lines per method). The LCOM metric of 0.6667 suggests a lack of cohesion among methods, meaning the class may be handling multiple responsibilities. With 5 fields (nof), it is possible that not all fields are used by every method, further supporting the need for decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
