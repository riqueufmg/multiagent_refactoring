    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.SimpleParameterAnnotationAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits high implementation complexity relative to its functionality, as indicated by a LOC of 25 with zero methods (nom=0) and zero public methods (nopm=0). This suggests that the class may be handling multiple responsibilities inline rather than delegating to separate methods. The LCOM value of -1.0 (a special case for zero methods) reinforces the lack of cohesive method structure. Although it has only one field (nof=1), the size (loc=25) and zero-method design imply that logic is embedded in initializers or other constructs, which could be decomposed into dedicated methods or helper classes to reduce complexity."
