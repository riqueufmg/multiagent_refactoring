    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 65 lines of code (loc) but only 3 fields (nof) and 0 methods (nom). The high code volume relative to its functionality suggests it is handling multiple responsibilities or complex logic in a monolithic structure, which could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and complexity."
