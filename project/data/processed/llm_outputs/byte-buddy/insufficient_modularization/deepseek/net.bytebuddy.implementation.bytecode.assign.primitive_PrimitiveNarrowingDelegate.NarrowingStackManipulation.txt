    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 constructors (nc=0) but contains 31 lines of code (loc=31) and 2 fields (nof=2). This indicates the code is likely implemented via static blocks or field initializations, leading to a monolithic structure that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused components."
