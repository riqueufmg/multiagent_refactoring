    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForDynamicInvocation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (nof=10) and a relatively high lines of code count (loc=107), yet it exhibits zero methods (nom=0) and no explicit public interface (nopm=0, nopf=0). This combination of high internal state without corresponding behavioral encapsulation indicates the class is likely a complex data structure or configuration holder that has not been decomposed into more focused, cohesive units, leading to high implementation complexity within a single class."
