    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Empty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating no functionality or state to decompose. The lines of code (loc=18) are low and likely consist of boilerplate or comments. The weighted method count (wmc=0) and lack of dependencies further suggest minimal complexity."
