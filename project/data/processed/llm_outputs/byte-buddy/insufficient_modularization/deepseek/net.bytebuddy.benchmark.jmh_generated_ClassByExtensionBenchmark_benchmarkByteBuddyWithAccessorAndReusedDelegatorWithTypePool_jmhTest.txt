    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 263 fields (nof=263), which is extremely high and indicates it aggregates numerous responsibilities that could be decomposed into separate classes. With 9 methods (nom=9) and 276 lines of code (loc=276), the class is large and complex, suggesting insufficient decomposition despite the cohesive metrics (lcom=0.0). The high number of fields relative to methods suggests poor data organization."
