    "justification": "The class has 127 lines of code (LOC) with 4 fields and 0 methods, indicating a potential data structure that combines multiple responsibilities in a single class without behavioral decomposition. The high LOC relative to number of fields suggests complex initialization or embedded logic that could be extracted into separate classes."
