    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ClassFileVersionMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 30 lines of code, 3 methods with a weighted method count of 3, and 2 fields. Its LCOM value of 0.0 indicates high cohesion, and it has low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics suggest the class is already small and focused, so further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity."
