{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.Absolute",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 field, 0 methods, 40 lines of code, and no evident internal structure that would benefit from further decomposition. The lack of methods, low field count, and absence of internal complexity metrics indicating multiple responsibilities suggest sufficient modularization for its current structure."
