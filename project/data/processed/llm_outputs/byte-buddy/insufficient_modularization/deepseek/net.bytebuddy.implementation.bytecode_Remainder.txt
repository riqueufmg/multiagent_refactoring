    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Remainder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low size (46 LOC) and low complexity (WMC=3) with only 3 methods and 2 fields. Despite moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.67), the small scale suggests further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
