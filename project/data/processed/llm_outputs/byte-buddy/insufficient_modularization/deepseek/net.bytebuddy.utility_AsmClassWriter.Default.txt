    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 226 lines of code (loc=226) with 0 methods (nom=0), indicating a large code block without proper method decomposition. The -1.0 LCOM value suggests no cohesion measurement due to lack of methods, further supporting that all functionality may be concentrated in a monolithic structure rather than separated into cohesive units."
