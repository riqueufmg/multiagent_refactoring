    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkJdkProxy_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low LOC (276) and moderate WMC (42) relative to its high number of fields (263), but the low LCOM (0.0) and absence of inherited complexity (DIT=0) suggest existing cohesion. The class is likely a generated JMH test harness, and further decomposition of its structure would not clearly reduce implementation complexity."
