    "justification": "The class has 62 lines of code (loc:62) with only 1 field (nof:1) and 0 methods (nom:0), indicating a high code-to-functionality ratio. This suggests the class likely contains multiple responsibilities or complex inline logic that could be decomposed into smaller, focused units."
