    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationRetention",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field, 3 methods, 36 lines of code, and a low cyclomatic complexity (WMC=3). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates high cohesion. These metrics suggest the class is already well-modularized and does not require further decomposition."
