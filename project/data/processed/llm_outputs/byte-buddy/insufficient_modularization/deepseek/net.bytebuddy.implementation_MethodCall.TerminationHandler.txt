    "justification": "Class with 177 lines of code contains 0 methods (nom=0) and 3 fields (nof=3), suggesting a large monolithic structure without behavioral decomposition. High LOC with zero methods indicates the class likely contains substantial procedural code that could be organized into separate methods or classes to reduce size and complexity."
