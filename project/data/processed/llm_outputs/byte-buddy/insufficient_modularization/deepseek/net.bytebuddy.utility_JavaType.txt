    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 186 lines of code (loc) and 9 methods (nom), which indicates a non-trivial size. It handles multiple responsibilities including type representation, loading strategies, and plugin integration (evidenced by dependencies on ClassLoadingStrategy, CachedReturnPlugin, and multiple TypeDescription classes). The presence of 5 public methods (nopm) and a latent inner class (JavaType.LatentTypeWithSimpleName) suggests that further decomposition into focused classes (e.g., separate classes for type loading, caching, or descriptor handling) could reduce size and complexity."
