    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.TypeVariableAnnotationAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high lines of code (loc=25) relative to low method count (nom=0), zero inherited methods (dit=0), and no internal method complexity (wmc=0). This suggests the 25 lines of code are not attributed to behavior but could represent monolithic annotation handling or excessive structural definition that could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
