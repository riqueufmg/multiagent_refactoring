    "justification": "Class has no methods (nom=0) and only 4 fields (nof=4), indicating low complexity despite relatively high lines of code (loc=108). Without methods, there is no behavioral complexity to decompose, and the class likely serves as a simple data container where further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity significantly."
