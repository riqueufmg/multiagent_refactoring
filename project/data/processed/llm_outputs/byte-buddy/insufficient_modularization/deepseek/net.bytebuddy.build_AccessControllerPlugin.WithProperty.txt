    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin.WithProperty",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 1 field (nof=1) but 26 lines of code (loc=26), indicating potential unused code or monolithic structure. The lack of methods suggests the class may contain inline implementation that could be extracted into separate methods, reducing size and complexity."
