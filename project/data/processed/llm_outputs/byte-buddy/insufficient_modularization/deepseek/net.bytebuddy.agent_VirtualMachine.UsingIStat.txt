    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (loc=86, wmc=0, nom=0, nopm=0, nof=4, nopf=0) and no dependencies, indicating it is already a small, simple class with minimal responsibilities. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
