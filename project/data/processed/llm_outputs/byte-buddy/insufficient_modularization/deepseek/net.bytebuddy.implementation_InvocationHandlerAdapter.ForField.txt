    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter.ForField",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high LOC (84) relative to its number of methods (0) and fields (2), indicating a potential lack of decomposition. Additionally, the class has multiple dependencies (5) but no methods, suggesting it might be handling multiple responsibilities or complex logic in an unstructured manner."
