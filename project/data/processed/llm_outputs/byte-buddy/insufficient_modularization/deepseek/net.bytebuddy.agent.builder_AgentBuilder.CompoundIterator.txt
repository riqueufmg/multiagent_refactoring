    "justification": "Class has 57 LOC with only 2 fields and 0 methods, indicating it may contain complex inline logic that could be decomposed. The LCOM value of -1.0 (special case for classes with 0 methods) suggests missing method-level modularization. The size-to-functionality ratio (57 LOC, 0 methods) implies potential for decomposition."
