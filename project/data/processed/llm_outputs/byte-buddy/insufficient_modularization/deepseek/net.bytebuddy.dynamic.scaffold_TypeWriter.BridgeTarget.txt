    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.BridgeTarget",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 76 lines of code (loc) but contains no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and minimal functionality (wmc=0, nc=0). This high loc-to-functionality ratio indicates that the class likely contains multiple responsibilities or complex implementations that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and complexity."
