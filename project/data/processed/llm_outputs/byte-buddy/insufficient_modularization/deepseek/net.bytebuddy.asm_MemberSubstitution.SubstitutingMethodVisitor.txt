    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.SubstitutingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 234 lines of code (loc) and 12 fields (nof), yet defines no methods (nom=0). This indicates the class contains substantial functionality that is not decomposed into methods, suggesting implementation logic is concentrated in constructor/initializer blocks or inherited methods rather than being modularized into separate, focused methods."
