    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender.Size",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and a weighted method count of 0 (wmc=0), indicating no behavioral complexity. It has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 48 lines of code (loc=48), which does not suggest excessive size or implementation complexity. Further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity significantly."
