    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy.Active",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high LOC (69) relative to its low number of fields (3) and absence of methods (0), indicating it likely contains monolithic initialization or complex internal logic. This, combined with dependencies on other classes (NexusAccessor, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeResolutionStrategy), suggests embedded responsibilities that could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
