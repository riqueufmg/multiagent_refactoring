    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.OfField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only two fields (nof=2) and zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating minimal functional complexity. With no methods, WMC=0 and LCOM is undefined (-1.0), suggesting no behavioral logic to modularize. The LOC of 35, while moderate, does not indicate significant implementation complexity warranting decomposition based on given metrics."
