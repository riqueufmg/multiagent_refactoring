    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.WithExplicitType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only one field (nof=1), indicating minimal functionality and state. The weighted method count (wmc=0) and lack of cohesion (lcom=-1) further suggest low complexity. With 25 lines of code, it might contain annotations or boilerplate, but there is no clear opportunity for further decomposition to reduce size or complexity, as the class is already minimal."
