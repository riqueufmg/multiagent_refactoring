    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Copying",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom) and 0 fields (nof) but 48 lines of code (loc), indicating a significant amount of implementation complexity that is not decomposed into methods or fields. This lack of internal structure suggests that the class could be further decomposed to reduce its size and complexity."
