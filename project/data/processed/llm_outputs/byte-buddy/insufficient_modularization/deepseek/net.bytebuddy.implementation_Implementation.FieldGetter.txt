    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.FieldGetter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity (79 LOC) and 7 external dependencies while having 0 methods and 3 fields. This indicates it likely contains substantial inline implementation logic that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and complexity."
