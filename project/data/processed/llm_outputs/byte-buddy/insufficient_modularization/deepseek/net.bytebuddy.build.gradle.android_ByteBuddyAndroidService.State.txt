    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidService.State",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 7 fields and 101 lines of code with no methods, indicating a data-heavy structure that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The presence of multiple external dependencies (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, etc.) suggests the class may be handling multiple responsibilities that could be separated."
