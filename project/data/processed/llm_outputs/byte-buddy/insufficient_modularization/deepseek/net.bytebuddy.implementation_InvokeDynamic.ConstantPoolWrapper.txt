    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ConstantPoolWrapper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom) but 177 lines of code (loc), indicating a high amount of code not organized into methods. This suggests that the class may contain complex initialization logic that could be decomposed into separate methods or helper classes to reduce size and complexity."
