    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), with minimal lines of code (loc=9) and zero weighted methods per class (wmc=0), indicating low size and complexity. Further decomposition is not warranted as there are no elements to decompose that would reduce size or implementation complexity."
