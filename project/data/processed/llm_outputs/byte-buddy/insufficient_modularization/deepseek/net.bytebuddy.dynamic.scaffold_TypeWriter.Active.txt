    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Active",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 0 methods and 40 lines of code (LOC), indicating a high density of code without functional decomposition. The absence of methods (nom=0) combined with 40 LOC suggests all behavior is implemented in initializers or constructors without proper method extraction, reducing modularity and increasing complexity."
