    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only one field (nof=1), with low lines of code (loc=28) and no method complexity (wmc=0). The absence of methods and minimal structure indicates the class is already highly focused, and further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
