    "justification": "Class has minimal complexity with no methods (nom=0) and low lines of code (loc=40). It contains only 3 fields (nof=3) with no inheritance (dit=0) or coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating it is already a focused, cohesive unit. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
