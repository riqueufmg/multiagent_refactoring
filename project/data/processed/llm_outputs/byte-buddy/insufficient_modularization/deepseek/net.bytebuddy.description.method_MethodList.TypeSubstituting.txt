    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and no constructors (nc=0), indicating no implementation complexity. The size (loc=40) is moderate, and without methods, further decomposition to reduce complexity is not applicable. The class has 3 fields, but there is no evidence of high complexity or large size that would warrant decomposition."
