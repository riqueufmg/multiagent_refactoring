{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForUrl",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 68 lines of code (loc=68) but no methods (nom=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2), indicating a large class with low functionality density. This suggests the class may contain complex initialization logic or multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units."
