    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 229 lines of code (high loc) and 6 fields (nof=6) but zero methods (nom=0), constructors (nc=0), and cohesion is undefined (lcom=-1.0). This indicates a significant size and potential complexity concentrated in field-level structures without behavioral modularization, suggesting further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
