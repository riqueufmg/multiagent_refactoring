    "justification": "The class has 77 lines of code (loc) but only 3 fields (nof) and 0 methods (nom). This high loc-to-functionality ratio suggests the class may contain complex initializers or static blocks that could be decomposed into separate classes or methods, reducing its size and potentially its complexity."
