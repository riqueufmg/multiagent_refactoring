    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 fields (nof=16) and 509 lines of code (loc=509), which are high values indicating significant size and potential complexity that could be reduced through decomposition. The class includes inner classes (nc=3) and has low cohesion (lcom=-1.0), suggesting it may be handling multiple responsibilities that could be separated."
