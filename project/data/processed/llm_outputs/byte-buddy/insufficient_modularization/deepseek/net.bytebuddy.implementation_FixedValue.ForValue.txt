    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted methods per class (wmc=0), indicating low implementation complexity. The lines of code (loc=77) are moderate, and with only four fields (nof=4), the size does not suggest a need for further decomposition. Cohesion metrics are not applicable due to no methods (lcom=-1.0)."
