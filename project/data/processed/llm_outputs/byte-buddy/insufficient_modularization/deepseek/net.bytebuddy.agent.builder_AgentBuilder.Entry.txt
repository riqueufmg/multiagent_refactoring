    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Entry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only 4 fields (nof=4), indicating low complexity. The lines of code (79) do not necessarily indicate high implementation complexity in the absence of methods. Further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity as the class is already minimal in behavior."
