    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.Invoker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods, 25 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 2, indicating it is already small and simple. The lack of fields and the high cohesion (as suggested by LCOM) also indicate that the class is focused. Therefore, further decomposition is not warranted."
