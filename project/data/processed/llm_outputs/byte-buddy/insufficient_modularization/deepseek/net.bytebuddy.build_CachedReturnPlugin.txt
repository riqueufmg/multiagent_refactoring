    "justification": "The class has 260 lines of code and 11 fields, indicating substantial size and potential for multiple responsibilities. With only 5 methods and a lack of cohesion (LCOM=0.8), the class likely groups unrelated functionalities. A WMC of 11 suggests moderate complexity that could be reduced by decomposition."
