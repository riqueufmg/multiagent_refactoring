    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 58 lines of code (loc=58), indicating significant size without modularization into distinct methods. Its lack of cohesion (lcom=-1.0) suggests no clear grouping of behaviors, and a high loc relative to no methods and 2 fields (nof=2) implies potential for decomposition to reduce complexity."
