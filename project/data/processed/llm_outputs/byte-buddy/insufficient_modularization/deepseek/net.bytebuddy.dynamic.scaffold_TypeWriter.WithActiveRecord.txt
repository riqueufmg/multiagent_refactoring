    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and only one field (nof=1), indicating minimal functionality and state. Although loc=37 is relatively high, the absence of methods suggests that further decomposition would not reduce complexity. Additionally, the class has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0)."
