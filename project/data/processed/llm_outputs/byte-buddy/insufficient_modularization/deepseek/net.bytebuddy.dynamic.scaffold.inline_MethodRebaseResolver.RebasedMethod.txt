    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3), indicating low complexity. Despite 82 lines of code (loc=82), the lack of methods and minimal fields suggest it is a simple data holder, and further decomposition would not reduce complexity or size meaningfully."
