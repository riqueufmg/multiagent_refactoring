    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.OfTrivialValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero fields (nof=0) and zero methods (nom=0) with no weighted method complexity (wmc=0) and no children (nc=0). This minimal structure already represents a trivial decomposition, and no further size or complexity reduction via modularization is indicated. The LOC metric (81) alone does not imply insufficient modularization without accompanying structural complexity."
