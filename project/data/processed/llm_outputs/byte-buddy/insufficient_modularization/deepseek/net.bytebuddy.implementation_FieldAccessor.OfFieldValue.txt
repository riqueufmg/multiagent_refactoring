    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.OfFieldValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one field and no methods, with 55 lines of code. While the lines of code are moderate, the lack of methods and single field suggest low complexity and limited functionality, making further decomposition unlikely to reduce size or complexity significantly."
