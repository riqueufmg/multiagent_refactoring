    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 99 lines of code (loc) but no methods (nom=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3), indicating a high amount of code relative to functionality. This suggests that the class may contain code that could be moved to separate methods or classes, reducing size and potentially complexity."
