    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.RebaseImplementationTarget.RebasedMethodInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low method count (nom=0) and low weighted method complexity (wmc=0), indicating minimal functional complexity. Its size (loc=87) and field count (nof=4) are moderate, while cohesion (lcom=-1.0) suggests no significant grouping issues. No evidence suggests further decomposition would notably reduce size or complexity."
