    "justification": "The class has 49 lines of code (loc) and 3 fields (nof) with 0 methods (nom). This suggests it may have been partially decomposed but still contains multiple responsibilities or data that could be further split. The non-zero field count without corresponding methods indicates potential data clustering without behavior separation."
