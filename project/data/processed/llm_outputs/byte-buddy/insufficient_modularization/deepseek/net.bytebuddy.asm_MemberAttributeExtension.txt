    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 fields, 304 lines of code (LOC), and 1 method with a weighted method complexity (WMC) of 1, indicating a high field count and large size concentrated in a single method. This suggests the class could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
