    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.ForSetter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (nof=11) and significant lines of code (loc=393), indicating it may be handling multiple responsibilities. The absence of methods (nom=0) and constructors (nc=0) suggests that all functionality is embedded within the class structure, leading to potential complexity and difficulty in maintenance. Decomposing the class could reduce its size and complexity, making it more manageable."
