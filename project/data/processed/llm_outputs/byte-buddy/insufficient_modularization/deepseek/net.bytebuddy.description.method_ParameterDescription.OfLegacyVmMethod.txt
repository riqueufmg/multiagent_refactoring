    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods, 0 constructors, 4 fields, and 73 lines of code. With no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and no behavior to decompose, further modularization would not reduce implementation complexity. The class appears to be a simple data structure with dependencies only for type declarations."
