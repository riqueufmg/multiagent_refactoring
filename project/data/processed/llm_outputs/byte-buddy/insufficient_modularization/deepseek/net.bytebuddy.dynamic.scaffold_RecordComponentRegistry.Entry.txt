    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 43 lines of code with only 3 fields and no methods, indicating high implementation complexity relative to its functionality. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) suggests undecomposed behavior potentially embedded in field initializations or annotations. The class could be decomposed to separate data representation from potential behavior implied by the five imported types in dependencies."
