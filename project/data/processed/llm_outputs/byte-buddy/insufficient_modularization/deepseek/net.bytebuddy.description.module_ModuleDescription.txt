    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 fields (nof=28) and 931 lines of code (loc=931), indicating a large class with high implementation complexity. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests low cohesion among methods, and the presence of multiple inner classes in dependencies (ModuleDescriptor, Provides, Exports, Opens, Requires, Optional, Module) indicates incomplete decomposition where responsibilities could be further separated."
