    "justification": "The class has 172 lines of code (size) and 5 fields, yet contains 0 methods. This indicates a high ratio of data to behavior, suggesting the class may be handling multiple responsibilities or complex initialization that could be decomposed into separate classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
