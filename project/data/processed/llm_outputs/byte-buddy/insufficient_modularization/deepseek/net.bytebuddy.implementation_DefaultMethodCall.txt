    "justification": "The class has moderate size (148 LOC, 9 methods, 4 fields), low complexity (WMC=12), and moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.56). The metrics do not strongly indicate that further decomposition would significantly reduce size or complexity, given the current implementation scale and lack of extreme metric thresholds."
