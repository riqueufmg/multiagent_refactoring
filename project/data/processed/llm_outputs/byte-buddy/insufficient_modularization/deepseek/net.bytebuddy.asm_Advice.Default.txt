    "justification": "Class has 42 lines of code (loc=42) with zero methods (nom=0) and zero fields (nof=0). This structure suggests the class likely contains substantial procedural or initialization code that could be decomposed into smaller, single-responsibility methods or helper classes to reduce size and complexity."
