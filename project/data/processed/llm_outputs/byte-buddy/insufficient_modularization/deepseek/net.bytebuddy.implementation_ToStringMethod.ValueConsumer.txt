    "justification": "The class has 309 lines of code (loc=309) with no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating a large monolithic block that lacks decomposition into smaller, cohesive units. The high LOC without modular structure suggests excessive complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition."
