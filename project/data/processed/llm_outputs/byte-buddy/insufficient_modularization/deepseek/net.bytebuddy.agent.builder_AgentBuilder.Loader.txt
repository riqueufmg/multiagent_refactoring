    "justification": "The class has 206 lines of code (loc) and 1 field (nof), but 0 methods (nom) and 0 weighted methods (wmc), indicating a large, monolithic structure with no behavioral decomposition. This suggests the class has not been sufficiently decomposed into smaller, more cohesive units to reduce its size and complexity."
