    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender.Target",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 167 lines of code (loc) and 6 fields (nof), yet contains 0 methods (nom), 0 constructors (nc), and 0 weighted methods per class (wmc). This indicates a large, complex class with structural complexity (fields and size) that lacks functional decomposition, suggesting further decomposition could reduce implementation complexity."
