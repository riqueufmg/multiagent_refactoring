    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.ExternalAttachment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 2 fields (nof=2) but 36 lines of code (loc=36), indicating high implementation complexity relative to its interface. This suggests the class may contain complex initialization, configuration, or other logic that could be decomposed into separate, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
