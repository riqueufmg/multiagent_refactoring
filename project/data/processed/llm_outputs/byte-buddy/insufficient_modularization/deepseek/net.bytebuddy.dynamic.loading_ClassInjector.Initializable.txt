    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating no functionality to decompose. Its lines of code (loc=15) are small and likely consist of boilerplate or comments. Further decomposition is not possible as there are no elements to split, and it would not reduce size or complexity."
