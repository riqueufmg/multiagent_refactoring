    "justification": "Class has 46 lines of code (LOC) but 0 methods (nom) and 1 field (nof), indicating that the class's complexity is concentrated in field initialization or initializer blocks without modularization into methods. This high LOC per field and absence of methods suggests that further decomposition into methods or helper classes could reduce complexity."
