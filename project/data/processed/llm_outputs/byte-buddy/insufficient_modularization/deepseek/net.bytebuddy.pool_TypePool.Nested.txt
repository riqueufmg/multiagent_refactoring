    "justification": "Class has 10 fields but 0 methods, suggesting it may be a data holder that could be decomposed. LOC (122) is relatively high for a class with no methods, and LCOM (-1.0) indicates no method cohesion, which can occur when multiple responsibilities are bundled together without behavioral decomposition."
