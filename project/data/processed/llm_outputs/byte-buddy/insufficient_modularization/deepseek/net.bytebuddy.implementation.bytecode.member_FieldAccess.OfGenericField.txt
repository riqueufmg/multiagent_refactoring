{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.FieldAccess.OfGenericField",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 2 fields, 0 methods, and 43 lines of code (LOC) with no cohesion (LCOM = -1.0). The high LOC relative to the lack of methods and cohesion suggests it is likely a monolithic class performing multiple responsibilities without proper decomposition. Zero methods indicate that all behavior may be implemented elsewhere in the class (e.g., constructors, initializers, or implicit methods), leading to insufficient modularization of functionality."
