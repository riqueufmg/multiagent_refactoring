    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 64 lines of code (loc=64), indicating a high proportion of code not organized into methods. This suggests the class may contain procedural code or complex logic that could be decomposed into separate methods or classes to reduce size and complexity."
