    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.SlicingIterable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 106 lines of code and 7 fields, but no methods (nom=0). This indicates a high size relative to its functionality, and the lack of methods suggests that complexity may be concentrated in the class body or initializers, which could be decomposed into methods or helper classes to reduce size and complexity."
