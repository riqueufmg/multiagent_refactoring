    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForMethodParameterArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 1 field (nof=1), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The lines of code (loc=67) are moderate but do not suggest excessive size given the lack of methods. Further decomposition is unlikely to reduce complexity or size significantly."
