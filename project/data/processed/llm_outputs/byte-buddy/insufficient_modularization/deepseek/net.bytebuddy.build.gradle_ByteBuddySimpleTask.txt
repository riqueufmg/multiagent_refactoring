    "justification": "The class has a moderate size (105 LOC) and low complexity (WMC=15, average cyclomatic complexity per method ~1.07). It shows good cohesion (LCOM=0.2857) and a manageable number of methods (14). No metric indicates excessive size or complexity that would necessitate further decomposition."
