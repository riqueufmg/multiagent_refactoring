    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.OfPrimitiveArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only two fields (nof=2), indicating minimal behavior and state. Complexity metrics are low (wmc=0, lcom=-1), and the lines of code (loc=60) may include comments or simple initializations. With no methods and low complexity, the class is already sufficiently modularized."
