    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.CacheProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high size (251 LOC) and 7 fields, with zero methods, indicating it likely contains complex initialization or embedded logic that could be separated. The lack of methods suggests procedural code embedded within the class structure, and further decomposition could reduce its size and complexity."
