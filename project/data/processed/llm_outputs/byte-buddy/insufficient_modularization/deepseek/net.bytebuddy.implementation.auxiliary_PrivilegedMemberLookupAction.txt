    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 103 lines of code (loc) and 5 methods (nom) with 9 weighted method complexity (wmc), indicating significant size and complexity. LCOM value of 0.4 suggests moderate lack of cohesion among methods. The class also depends on 13 external types, suggesting it may be handling multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units."
