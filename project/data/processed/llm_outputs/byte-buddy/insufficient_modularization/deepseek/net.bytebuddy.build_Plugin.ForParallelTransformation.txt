    "justification": "Class has 209 lines of code (loc=209) and 12 fields (nof=12) with 0 methods (nom=0), indicating high complexity concentrated in field declarations/initializations without behavioral decomposition. The significant size (209 lines) with zero methods suggests monolithic structure where responsibilities could be further modularized into separate classes."
