    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForEnterValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0), minimal complexity (wmc=0), and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating no behavioral logic to modularize. The 7 fields and 116 LOC suggest a data-only or simple annotation class, with no evidence of implementation complexity that decomposition could reduce."
