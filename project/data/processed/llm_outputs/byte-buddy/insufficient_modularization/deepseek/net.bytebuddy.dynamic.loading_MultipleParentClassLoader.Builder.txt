    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.MultipleParentClassLoader.Builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 179 lines of code (high size) with 0 methods and only 2 fields, indicating it likely contains significant procedural code or complex initialization logic that hasn't been decomposed into meaningful methods. The negative LCOM (-1.0) suggests no method cohesion analysis is possible due to absence of methods, further supporting that all logic is concentrated in monolithic code blocks rather than modular units."
