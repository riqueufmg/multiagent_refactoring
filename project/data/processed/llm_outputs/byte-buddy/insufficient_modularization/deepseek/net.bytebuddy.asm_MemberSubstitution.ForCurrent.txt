    "justification": "The class has 95 lines of code (loc) and 6 fields (nof) with 0 methods (nom), indicating a potentially high data-to-behavior ratio. This suggests the class may be serving multiple purposes or holding unrelated state, which could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive classes to reduce size and complexity."
