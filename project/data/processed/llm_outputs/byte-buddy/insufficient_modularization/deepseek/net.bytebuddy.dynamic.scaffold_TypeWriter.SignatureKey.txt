    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0) and only two fields (nof=2), indicating minimal implementation complexity. Although lines of code (loc=31) are relatively high, there are no methods to decompose and the class appears to be a simple data holder. Further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
