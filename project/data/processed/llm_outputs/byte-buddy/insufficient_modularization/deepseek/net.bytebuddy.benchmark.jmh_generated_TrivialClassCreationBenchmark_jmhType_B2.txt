    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 fields (nof=12) but no methods (nom=0) and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). Its weighted method count is zero (wmc=0), indicating no implementation complexity. Given the small size and absence of methods, further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
