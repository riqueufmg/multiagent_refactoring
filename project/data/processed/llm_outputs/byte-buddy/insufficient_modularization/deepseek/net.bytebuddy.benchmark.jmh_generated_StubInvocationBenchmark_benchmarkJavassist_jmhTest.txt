    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkJavassist_jmhTest",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has an extremely high number of fields (263), which indicates it likely handles many distinct concerns or data items that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes. Additionally, its weighted method complexity (42) for 9 methods suggests moderate complexity that could be reduced through decomposition."
