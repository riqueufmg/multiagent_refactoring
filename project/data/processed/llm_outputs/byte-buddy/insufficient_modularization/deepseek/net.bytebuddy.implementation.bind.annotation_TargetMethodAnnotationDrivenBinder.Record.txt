    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), zero methods (nom=0), and minimal lines of code (loc=51). With no methods and low field count, there is insufficient complexity to warrant further decomposition. The lack of methods (WMC=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that doesn't justify additional modularization."
