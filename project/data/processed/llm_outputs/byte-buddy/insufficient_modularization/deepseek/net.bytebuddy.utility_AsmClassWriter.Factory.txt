    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.Factory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high lines of code count (299) with no methods (nom=0) and 4 fields, indicating a significant amount of code likely concentrated in constructors or initializers. This suggests the class is handling multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
