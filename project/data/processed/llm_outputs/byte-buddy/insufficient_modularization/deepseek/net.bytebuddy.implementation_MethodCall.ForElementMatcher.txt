    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForElementMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0), indicating low implementation complexity. With 5 fields (nof=5) and 69 lines of code (loc=69), it is moderately sized but lacks behavioral elements that would benefit from decomposition. Further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity significantly."
