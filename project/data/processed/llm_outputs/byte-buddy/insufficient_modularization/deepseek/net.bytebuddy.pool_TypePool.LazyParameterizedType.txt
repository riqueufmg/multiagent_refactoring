{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyParameterizedType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 fields (nof=6) and 79 lines of code (loc=79) while containing zero methods (nom=0). This indicates it may be handling multiple responsibilities or containing substantial implementation complexity within field initializations or inner structures that could be decomposed. The absence of methods suggests the class might be performing work through other means that could be modularized into separate classes or methods."
