    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating low implementation complexity. While the lines of code (loc=39) are moderate, the absence of methods suggests that further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
