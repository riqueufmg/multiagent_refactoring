    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Node",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0) and only three fields (nof=3), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The lines of code (loc=51) are moderate, and with no methods (wmc=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
