    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 85 lines of code (size) and 5 fields but 0 methods, indicating a high density of data and potentially complex field interactions without modular methods. It shows no cohesion (LCOM = -1.0) and has 7 external dependencies, suggesting it may handle multiple responsibilities that could be separated."
