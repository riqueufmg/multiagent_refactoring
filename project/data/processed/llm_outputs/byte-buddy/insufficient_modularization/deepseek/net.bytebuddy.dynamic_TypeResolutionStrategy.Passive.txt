    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating no implementation complexity. The weighted methods per class (wmc=0) and lack of cohesion (lcom=-1.0) further support that the class is already minimal. With no dependencies, there is no indication that the class is doing too much or can be further decomposed to reduce size or complexity."
