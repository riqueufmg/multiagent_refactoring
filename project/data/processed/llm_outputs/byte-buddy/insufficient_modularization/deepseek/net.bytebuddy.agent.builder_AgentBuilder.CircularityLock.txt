    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.CircularityLock",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 201 lines of code (loc=201) and 7 fields (nof=7) but no methods (nom=0), indicating a large class without behavioral decomposition. The high loc relative to the number of fields and absence of methods suggests that the class may contain complex initialization or static blocks that could be modularized further to reduce size and complexity."
