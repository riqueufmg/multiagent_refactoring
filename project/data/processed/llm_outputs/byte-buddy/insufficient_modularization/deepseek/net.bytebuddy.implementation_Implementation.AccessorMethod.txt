    "justification": "Class has 0 methods but 3 fields and 80 lines of code (loc). This indicates a data structure or configuration block that may contain multiple responsibilities lumped together without behavioral decomposition. The lack of methods despite significant code size suggests the class may be handling complex initialization or data aggregation that could be split into smaller, more focused units."
