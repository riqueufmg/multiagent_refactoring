    "justification": "The class has 279 lines of code (loc) and 14 fields (nof), which is a large size for a class with no methods (nom=0) or constructors (nc=0). The absence of methods indicates it may be handling multiple responsibilities through its fields, and the high field count relative to no behavior suggests it could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive classes to reduce size and complexity."
