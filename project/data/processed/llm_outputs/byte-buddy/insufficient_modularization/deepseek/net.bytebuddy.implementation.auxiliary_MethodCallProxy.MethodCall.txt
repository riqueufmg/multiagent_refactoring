    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and minimal fields (nof=3), indicating a focused, data-oriented structure with low complexity. The LOC (62) is moderate, and the lack of method complexity (wmc=0) suggests no further decomposition would meaningfully reduce size or implementation complexity."
