    "justification": "The class has only 44 lines of code (loc) and one field (nof=1) with no methods (nom=0), indicating minimal size and complexity. There are no methods to decompose, and the class is already an inner class, suggesting appropriate encapsulation. No metric suggests excessive size or complexity warranting further decomposition."
