    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForClassLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 208 lines of code (loc) and 0 methods (nom), indicating a significant amount of code not organized into methods, which suggests insufficient decomposition. The high loc and absence of methods (despite having fields) imply the class likely contains complex inline logic that could be modularized into separate methods to reduce size and complexity."
