    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 187 lines of code (loc) and 4 fields (nof) but 0 methods (nom), indicating it may contain complex field initialization logic or embedded functionality that could be decomposed. The absence of methods suggests potential procedural code embedded within field declarations or constructors not captured in method metrics."
