    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ClassLoadingDelegate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 292 lines of code (high size) and 9 fields, yet it has 0 methods. This indicates a substantial amount of data or logic that is not broken down into methods, suggesting the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and implementation complexity."
