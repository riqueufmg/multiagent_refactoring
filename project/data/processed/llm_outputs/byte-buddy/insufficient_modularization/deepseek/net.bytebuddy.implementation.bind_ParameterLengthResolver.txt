    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity (WMC=3, LOC=23) and a single public method, indicating it already encapsulates a well-defined, cohesive responsibility. With no fields and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
