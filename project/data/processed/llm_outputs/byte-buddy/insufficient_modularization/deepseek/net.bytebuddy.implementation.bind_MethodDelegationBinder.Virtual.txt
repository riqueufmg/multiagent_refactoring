    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) yet occupies 22 lines of code (loc=22), indicating potential unused or dead code. Zero weighted methods (wmc=0) combined with non-trivial size suggests leftover scaffolding or incomplete decomposition. Single field (nof=1) without methods suggests the class may be a data holder or configuration class that could be merged elsewhere or split into proper utility classes."
