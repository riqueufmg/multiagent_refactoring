    "justification": "Class has no methods (nom=0) and no constructors (nc=0), indicating it is likely a simple data holder or inner class with 4 fields. With only 63 lines of code (loc=63) and no complexity metrics suggesting high implementation complexity (wmc=0, lcom=-1), further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
