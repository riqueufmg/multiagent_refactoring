    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.ConstructorStrategy.ForDefaultConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0), only two fields (nof=2), and no nested classes (nc=0), indicating low implementation complexity. While LOC (79) is relatively high, the absence of methods suggests the size may be due to initializers or annotations rather than functional complexity that would benefit from decomposition."
