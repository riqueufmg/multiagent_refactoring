    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.TypeVariableDefinition",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 165 lines of code (loc) but no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating a potential lack of modularization. The high loc relative to the absence of methods and fields suggests the class may be performing multiple tasks or containing extensive code that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or interfaces."
