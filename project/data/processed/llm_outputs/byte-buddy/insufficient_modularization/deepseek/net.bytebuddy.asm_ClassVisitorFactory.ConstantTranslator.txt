    "justification": "Class has no methods (nom=0) and low complexity (wmc=0, lcom=-1) with only 7 fields, indicating minimal implementation complexity. Dependencies are limited to two external classes. The 93 lines of code do not inherently suggest insufficient decomposition without evidence of high complexity or multiple responsibilities."
