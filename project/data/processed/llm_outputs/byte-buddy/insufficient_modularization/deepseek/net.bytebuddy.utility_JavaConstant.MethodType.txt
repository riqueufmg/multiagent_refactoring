    "justification": "The class has minimal size (17 LOC) and complexity (0 WMC, 0 methods, 0 fields), showing it's already highly focused. No evidence of multiple responsibilities or high complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. Dependencies appear reasonable for a utility class in its domain."
