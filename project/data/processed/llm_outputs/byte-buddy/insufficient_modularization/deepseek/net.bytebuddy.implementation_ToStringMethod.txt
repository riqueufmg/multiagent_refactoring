    "justification": "The class has 15 fields, 11 methods, and 605 lines of code, indicating high size and complexity. The LCOM value of 0.545 suggests moderate cohesion. The presence of multiple inner classes (Appender, ValueConsumer, PrefixResolver) in dependencies hints at related responsibilities that could be further decomposed into separate classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
