    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.PatchingModuleVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 144 lines of code and contains 7 fields without any methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating a high concentration of data without associated behaviors. This lack of behavioral encapsulation and high lines-of-code for a class with no methods suggests the class may be handling multiple concerns that could be decomposed into separate classes or methods to reduce size and complexity."
