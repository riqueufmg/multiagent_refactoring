    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and only 3 fields (nof=3), indicating low behavioral complexity. Although the lines of code (loc=53) are somewhat high, this may be due to comments or initializations, and there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities that would warrant further decomposition."
