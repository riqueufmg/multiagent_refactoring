    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMatchedDynamicInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and low complexity (wmc=0), with only 4 fields (nof=4). The lines of code (loc=67) are moderate, and without methods, there is little behavior to decompose. The class appears to be a focused data holder or configuration class, suggesting further decomposition would not significantly reduce size or complexity."
