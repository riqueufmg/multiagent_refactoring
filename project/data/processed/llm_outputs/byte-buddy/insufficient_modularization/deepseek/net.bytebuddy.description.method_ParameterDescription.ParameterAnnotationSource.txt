    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 54 lines of code (loc) and contains 2 fields (nof) but 0 methods (nom). This lack of methods combined with a relatively high loc value suggests it may be a monolithic class handling multiple responsibilities or containing complex initializations/annotations that could be separated, indicating insufficient modularization."
