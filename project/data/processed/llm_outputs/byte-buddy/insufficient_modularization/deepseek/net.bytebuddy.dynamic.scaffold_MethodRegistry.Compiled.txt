    "justification": "Class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 12 fields (nof=12), indicating it's primarily a data structure rather than a behavior-heavy class. The 142 lines of code (loc=142) are within reasonable bounds for a data container with 12 fields. No significant implementation complexity exists (wmc=0, lcom=-1), and decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
