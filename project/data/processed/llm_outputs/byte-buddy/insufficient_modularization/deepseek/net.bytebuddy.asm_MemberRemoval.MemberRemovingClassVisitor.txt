    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 4 fields (nof=4), with 44 lines of code (loc=44). The absence of methods indicates low complexity (wmc=0), and the moderate number of fields does not suggest excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
