    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom) and only 2 fields (nof), indicating minimal internal complexity. With 0 methods, there is no implementation complexity to decompose, and the class size (115 loc) does not inherently indicate insufficient modularization without evidence of complex, multi-responsibility methods."
