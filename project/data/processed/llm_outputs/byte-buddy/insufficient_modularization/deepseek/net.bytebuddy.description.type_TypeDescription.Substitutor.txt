    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Substitutor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 313 lines of code (loc=313), indicating substantial code without proper method decomposition. The high LOC-to-method ratio suggests implementation complexity concentrated in the class body rather than being modularized into methods."
