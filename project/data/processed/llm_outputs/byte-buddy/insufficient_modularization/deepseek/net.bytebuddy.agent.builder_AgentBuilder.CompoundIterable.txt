    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.CompoundIterable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 79 lines of code but declares no methods, indicating that the implementation complexity is not encapsulated in methods and may be contained in field initializations or anonymous classes. This lack of modularization within the class suggests that further decomposition could reduce its complexity and size."
