    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal implementation (loc=34) with a single field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it is already a focused, simple construct. Low complexity metrics (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest no meaningful decomposition is possible to reduce size or complexity."
