    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMethodInvocation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 189 lines of code (loc) with 9 fields (nof) and 0 methods (nom), indicating a high code-to-field ratio and no functional methods. This suggests the class may contain complex initializations or data structures that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
