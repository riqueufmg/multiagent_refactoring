    "justification": "The class has minimal size (loc=41, nof=1) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0), indicating no significant complexity to decompose. LCOM is undefined (-1), and fanin/fanout are zero, showing low coupling. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
