    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.FieldResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 81 lines of code (loc=81) and 3 fields (nof=3) but zero methods (nom=0), indicating a substantial amount of code is not decomposed into methods. This absence of methods suggests the class likely centralizes functionality within its structure rather than distributing responsibilities across smaller, more manageable units. The lack of modularization within the class increases its implementation complexity, as all logic is aggregated without functional decomposition."
