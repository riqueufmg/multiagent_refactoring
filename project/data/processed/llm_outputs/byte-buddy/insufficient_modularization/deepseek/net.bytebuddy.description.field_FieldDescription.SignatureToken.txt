    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0) and only two fields (nof=2), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The lines of code (loc=54) are not excessively high given the absence of methods, and there are no indicators (such as high WMC or LCOM) suggesting that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
