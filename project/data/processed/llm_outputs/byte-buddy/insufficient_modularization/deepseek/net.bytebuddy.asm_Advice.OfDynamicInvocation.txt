    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OfDynamicInvocation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 54 lines of code (loc) and 0 methods (nom), with a high loc-to-method ratio suggesting low decomposition. The lack of methods (nom=0) and negative LCOM (-1.0) indicate no cohesive behavior is defined, yet the class has 3 fields (nof) and dependencies, implying it may be handling multiple responsibilities without modularization."
