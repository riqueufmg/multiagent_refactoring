    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero methods, zero fields, zero constructors, and zero weighted methods per class, indicating minimal functionality and complexity. While lines of code (18) might suggest some implementation, the lack of any structural elements means there is no meaningful functionality to further decompose."
