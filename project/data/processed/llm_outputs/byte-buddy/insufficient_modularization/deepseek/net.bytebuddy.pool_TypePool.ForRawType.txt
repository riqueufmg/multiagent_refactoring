    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForRawType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity (0 methods, 0 weighted method count, 34 lines of code) and a single field. The lack of methods and low implementation size indicates it is already a focused unit, leaving no clear opportunity for decomposition to reduce size or complexity."
