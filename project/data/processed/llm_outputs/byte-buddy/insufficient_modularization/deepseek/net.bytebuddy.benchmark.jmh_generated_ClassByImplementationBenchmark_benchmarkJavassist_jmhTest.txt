    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 263 fields (nof) and 276 lines of code (loc), indicating a large size that could be reduced by decomposition. Although LCOM is 0.0, the high number of fields and moderate complexity (wmc=42) suggest that splitting the class could reduce implementation complexity and size."
