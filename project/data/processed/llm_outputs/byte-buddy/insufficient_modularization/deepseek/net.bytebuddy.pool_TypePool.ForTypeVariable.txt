    "justification": "The class has 20 fields (nof=20) and 290 lines of code (loc=290) with 0 methods (nom=0). This large size and structural complexity for a class containing only data fields suggests insufficient decomposition, as the data could be encapsulated into smaller, more cohesive data structures."
