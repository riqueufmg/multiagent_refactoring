    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.WithInnerClassLoadingLock",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 67 lines of code but no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it likely contains procedural code or complex initialization that hasn't been decomposed into methods. The high loc-to-methods ratio (67:0) suggests insufficient decomposition of functionality within the class."
