    "justification": "Class has high LOC (36) relative to minimal functionality (0 methods, 1 field) suggesting it likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be separated. LCOM value of -1.0 indicates no cohesive methods group, but with 0 methods this suggests the class may be doing work through other means (constructors, initializers) that should be modularized."
