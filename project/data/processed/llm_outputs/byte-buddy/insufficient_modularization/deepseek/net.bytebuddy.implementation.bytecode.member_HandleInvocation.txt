    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.HandleInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class exhibits low complexity with small size (LOC=32, WMC=2) and low method count (nom=2). Metrics indicate high cohesion (LCOM=0.0) and no dependencies on many other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0). The current modularization appears sufficient for its responsibilities, and further decomposition would not clearly reduce size or complexity."
