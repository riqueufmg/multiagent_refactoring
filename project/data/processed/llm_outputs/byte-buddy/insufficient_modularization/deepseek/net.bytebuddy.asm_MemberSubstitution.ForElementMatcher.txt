    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0) but 46 lines of code (loc=46), indicating implementation complexity concentrated in field declarations or initializers without proper method decomposition. The presence of 2 fields (nof=2) and 4 external dependencies suggests responsibilities that could be encapsulated into separate methods or classes to reduce complexity."
