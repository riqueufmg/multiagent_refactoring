    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods (nom=0), with a weighted method count of 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The lines of code (loc=76) are likely due to field declarations or comments, and with no methods, further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
