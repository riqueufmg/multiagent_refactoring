    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High LOC (506) and WMC (9) relative to the number of methods (9) indicate significant implementation complexity. The class contains 2 inner classes and depends on multiple other inner classes (e.g., Factory, CreationAction, Callback, ForLegacyVm, WithCallback, WithDelegation), suggesting multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into separate units to reduce size and complexity."
