    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and therefore no implementation complexity. Although it has 11 fields and 142 lines of code, without methods, further decomposition is unlikely to reduce complexity and might not significantly reduce size if the fields are inherently cohesive."
