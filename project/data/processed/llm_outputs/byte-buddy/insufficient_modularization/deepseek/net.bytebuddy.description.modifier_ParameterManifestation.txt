    "justification": "The class has only one field and a high Lack of Cohesion of Methods (LCOM=0.8), indicating the methods are loosely related and could be split into more cohesive modules. Additionally, the Weighted Methods per Class (WMC=5) and Lines of Code (LOC=46) suggest complexity that may be reduced via decomposition."
