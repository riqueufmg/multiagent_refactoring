    "justification": "Class has 137 lines of code (loc) and 4 fields (nof) with 0 methods (nom). High size combined with lack of method decomposition suggests the class may be handling multiple responsibilities or complex logic in an unmodularized way, possibly in initializers or nested structures, indicating insufficient modularization."
