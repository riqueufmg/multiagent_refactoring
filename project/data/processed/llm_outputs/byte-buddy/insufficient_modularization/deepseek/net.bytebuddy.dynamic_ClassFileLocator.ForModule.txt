    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and a low weighted method count (wmc=0), indicating no behavioral complexity. While the lines of code (loc=143) are relatively high, without any methods, there is no functionality to further decompose. The class appears to be a data holder with minimal complexity."
