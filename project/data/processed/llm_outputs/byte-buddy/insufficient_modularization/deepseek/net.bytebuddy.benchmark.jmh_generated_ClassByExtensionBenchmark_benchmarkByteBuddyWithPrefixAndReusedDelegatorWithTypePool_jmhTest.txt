    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has an extremely high number of fields (263), which suggests it is handling multiple concerns and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity. The lines of code (276) and weighted method complexity (42) further indicate that decomposition might reduce implementation complexity."
