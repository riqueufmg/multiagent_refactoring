    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.DefaultMethodInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero methods (nom=0) and zero fields (nof=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity and no clear responsibilities to decompose further. The LOC of 35 suggests the class may consist primarily of structural code (e.g., declarations) rather than complex logic warranting modularization."
