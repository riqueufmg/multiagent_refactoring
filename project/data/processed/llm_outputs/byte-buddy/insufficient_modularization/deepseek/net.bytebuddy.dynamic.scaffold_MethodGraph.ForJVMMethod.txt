    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.ForJVMMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), and minimal dependencies (fanout=0). It is already a nested class, indicating decomposition, and the absence of methods suggests no behavioral complexity requiring further modularization."
