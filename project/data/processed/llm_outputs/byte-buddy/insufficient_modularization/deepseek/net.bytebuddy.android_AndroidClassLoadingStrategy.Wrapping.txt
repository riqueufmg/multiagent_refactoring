{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.Wrapping",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 36 lines of code (loc=36) and depth of inheritance 2 (dit=2) while containing zero methods (nom=0), zero fields (nof=0), and no functional complexity (wmc=0), indicating it likely contains monolithic code that could be decomposed. The absence of methods/fields with non-trivial LOC suggests insufficient decomposition of responsibilities within the class."
