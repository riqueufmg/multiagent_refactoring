    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.FieldConstant.Cached",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 41 lines of code (loc=41) but defines no methods (nom=0), indicating potential insufficient decomposition. The combination of moderate size with zero methods suggests the class may contain logic that could be extracted into separate methods or classes to reduce size and complexity."
