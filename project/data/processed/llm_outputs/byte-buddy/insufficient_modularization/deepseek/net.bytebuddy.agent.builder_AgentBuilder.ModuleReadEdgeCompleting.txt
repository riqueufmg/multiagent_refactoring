    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 55 lines of code (loc) but 0 methods (nom) and 0 public methods (nopm), indicating it contains only field declarations and/or complex initializations without behavioral abstraction. Its 3 fields (nof) with 3 external dependencies suggest cohesive data grouping without corresponding modular behavior, making further decomposition beneficial for reducing size and complexity."
