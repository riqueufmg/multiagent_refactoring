    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 136 lines of code (loc) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating a high amount of code without behavior. This suggests the class may contain excessive initialization or data definition code that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
