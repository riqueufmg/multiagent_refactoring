    "justification": "The class has 373 lines of code (loc) and 16 fields (nof), yet contains no methods (nom=0, nopm=0). This significant imbalance between data (fields) and behavior (methods), along with the high size and zero methods, indicates the class is likely a large data container or configuration class that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or data structures."
