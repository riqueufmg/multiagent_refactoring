    "justification": "The class has 263 fields (nof=263), which is extremely high, indicating it may be holding too many attributes and responsibilities. Despite having only 9 methods (nom=9) and 276 lines of code (loc=276), further decomposition could reduce complexity by grouping related fields into separate classes."
