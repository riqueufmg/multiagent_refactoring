    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.AnnotationLookup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 3 fields, and 39 lines of code (moderate size). The lack of methods and low complexity metrics indicate minimal implementation complexity, and no dependencies suggest limited external interactions. Further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity significantly."
