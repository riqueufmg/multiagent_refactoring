    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0) indicating minimal implementation complexity. With only 51 lines of code (loc=51) and weighted methods per class of 0 (wmc=0), the class is already at minimal size and complexity. No further decomposition would meaningfully reduce implementation complexity."
