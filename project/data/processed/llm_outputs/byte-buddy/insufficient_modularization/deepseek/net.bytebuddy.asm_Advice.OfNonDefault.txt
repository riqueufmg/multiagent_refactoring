    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OfNonDefault",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one field (nof=1), no methods (nom=0), and zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With 22 lines of code (loc=22), the size is moderate but not excessive for a class with such low complexity. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
