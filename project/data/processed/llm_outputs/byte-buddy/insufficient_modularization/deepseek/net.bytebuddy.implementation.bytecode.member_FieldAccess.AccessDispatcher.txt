    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with no methods (nom=0) and no public methods (nopm=0). It has only one field (nof=1), indicating limited responsibility. With zero weighted methods (wmc=0) and no dependencies (fanout=0), further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
