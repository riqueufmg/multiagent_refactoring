    "justification": "The class has 4 fields and 0 methods, yet it contains 76 lines of code (loc) and exhibits a lack of cohesion (lcom = -1.0). This high code volume without any methods indicates the class has low cohesion and excessive initialization or structural complexity that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and complexity."
