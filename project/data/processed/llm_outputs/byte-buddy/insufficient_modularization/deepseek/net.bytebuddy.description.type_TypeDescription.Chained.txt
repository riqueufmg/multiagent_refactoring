    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Chained",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 0 methods (nom=0) but 28 lines of code (loc=28) with one dependency, indicating potential undisclosed complexity within the class. The combination of relatively high loc for a class without methods suggests insufficient decomposition of code that could be organized into separate methods or classes."
