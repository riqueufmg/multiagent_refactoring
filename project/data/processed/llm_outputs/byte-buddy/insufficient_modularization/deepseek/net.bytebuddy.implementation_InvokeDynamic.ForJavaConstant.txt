    "justification": "The class has only one field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) with zero weighted methods (wmc=0), indicating minimal complexity. The lines of code (loc=28) are moderate, but with no methods and a single field, further decomposition is not feasible to reduce size or complexity."
