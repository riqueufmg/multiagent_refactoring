    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor.LocalVariableAwareMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field, 3 methods, 34 lines of code, and a weighted method count of 8, indicating low complexity and size. Additionally, its lack of cohesion (LCOM = 0.0) suggests high cohesion among methods. Therefore, further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity significantly."
