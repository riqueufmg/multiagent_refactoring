    "justification": "Class has high lines of code (237) with 0 methods and 4 fields, indicating it contains significant implementation complexity without functional decomposition. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests potential cohesion issues, and high fanout (11 dependencies) further indicates the class may be handling multiple responsibilities that could be separated."
