    "justification": "The class has 40 fields (nof=40) and 1213 lines of code (loc=1213), which are extremely high values indicating excessive size and responsibility concentration. The absence of methods (nom=0) suggests it may be a large data container or configuration class that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce complexity."
