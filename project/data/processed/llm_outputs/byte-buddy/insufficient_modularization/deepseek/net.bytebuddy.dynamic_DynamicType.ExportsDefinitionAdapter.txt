    "justification": "The class has a small number of fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0), moderate lines of code (loc=49), and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0), with minimal dependencies, indicating that further decomposition would not significantly reduce size or implementation complexity."
