    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodNameTransformer.Suffixing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2), indicating low implementation complexity. Although loc=33 is moderate, the absence of methods suggests the class is a simple data holder or configuration class, and further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity."
