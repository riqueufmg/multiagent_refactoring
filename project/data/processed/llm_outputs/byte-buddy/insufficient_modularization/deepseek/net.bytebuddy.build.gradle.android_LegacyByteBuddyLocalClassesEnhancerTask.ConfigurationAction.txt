    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.LegacyByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask.ConfigurationAction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 33 lines of code and 3 fields, but 0 methods (nom=0) and an LCOM of -1.0, indicating no method cohesion. This suggests the class may be acting as a data holder or configuration block that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
