    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.CompoundList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (nom=5), low weighted method complexity (wmc=7), moderate lines of code (loc=75), and no instance fields (nof=0), indicating it is already sufficiently modularized with no clear need for further decomposition to reduce size or complexity."
