The file contains multiple nested types (MethodLoading, TypeCastingHandler, NoOp, ForBridgeTarget, OffsetLoading, OffsetWriting, OffsetIncrementing) representing distinct responsibilities (loading, writing, incrementing, type casting, no-op behavior). Low cohesion (lcom 0.3) and a bloated interface indicate the abstraction has not been sufficiently decomposed and should be split into smaller, focused classes."
