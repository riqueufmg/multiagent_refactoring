It depends on and implements many distinct roles (annotation reading, rendering, builders, validators, class loading delegates, numerous variant inner classes) which indicates multiple responsibilities concentrated in one abstraction instead of being split into cohesive smaller classes. The volume and variety of dependencies and nested classes suggest the abstraction is insufficiently decomposed."

The size and scope indicate it handles many aspects of generic type representation and behavior in one place, combining responsibilities that could be separated (formatting/rendering, variable handling, substitutions, etc.). This concentration of functionality in a single nested class signals insufficient modularization."

Its nested types are small variants that appear to represent different shapes/implementations of the same cohesive abstraction. The metrics and structure suggest focused responsibilities and reasonable decomposition via small inner types rather than a single monolithic class."
