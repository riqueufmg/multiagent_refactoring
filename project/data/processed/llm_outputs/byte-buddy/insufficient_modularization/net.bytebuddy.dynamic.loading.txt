It depends on many subsystems and mixes multiple injection strategies and platform-specific logic, indicating concentrated responsibilities that would be clearer and easier to maintain if split into smaller, cohesive components."

      "justification": "Large implementation (LOC 1127) with many members (nof 32, nom 21) and multiple inner classes (SynchronizationStrategy, PersistenceHandler, ChildFirst, UrlDefinitionAction, ByteArrayUrlStreamHandler, etc.). It handles class loading mechanics, URL handling, persistence, synchronization and strategy selection, suggesting too many responsibilities for a single class and benefiting from decomposition."

      "justification": "Substantial size (LOC 450, nof 21) and several nested strategy variants (Default, WrappingDispatcher, InjectionDispatcher, Configurable, UsingLookup, ForUnsafeInjection, etc.). The class encapsulates multiple loading strategies and glue logic, indicating a bloated abstraction that would be clearer if responsibilities were separated into distinct strategy classes or modules."

It aggregates multiple concerns related to module construction, representation and orchestration, suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller module-related abstractions."

      "class": "ClassLoaderDecorator",
      "detection": false,
      "justification": "Relatively small (LOC 70, nom 2) with a narrow role (decorating class loaders) and limited complexity. The presence of a NoOp inner type is consistent with strategy/variation patterns without indicating an overly bloated abstraction."

Its scope appears cohesive (strategy subtypes are limited) and does not exhibit the breadth of responsibilities seen in the larger classes above."
