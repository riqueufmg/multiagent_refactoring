    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 12 classes totaling 959 LOC, with a clear concentration of size and complexity in a few large classes: PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate (235 LOC, WMC 23), PrimitiveNarrowingDelegate (180 LOC, WMC 19), PrimitiveWideningDelegate (178 LOC, WMC 19) and PrimitiveBoxingDelegate (130 LOC, WMC 11). Several inner classes further increase the class count and responsibilities. The package centralizes many related but distinct responsibilities (boxing, unboxing, widening, narrowing) into large, complex classes and nested types, while having no afferent coupling (Ca = 0) and moderate efferent coupling (Ce = 6), indicating concentrated implementation rather than widely reused, modular components. These facts support that the package is excessively large and acts as a God Component."
