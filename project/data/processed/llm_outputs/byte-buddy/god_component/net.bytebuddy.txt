    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 32 classes and 3,541 LOC overall, with several very large classes concentrated in the package. The top class ByteBuddy alone is 898 LOC with 52 methods and WMC 59, indicating high complexity and many responsibilities. Other large classes include ClassFileVersion (476 LOC), NamingStrategy (381 LOC) and TypeCache (369 LOC). The ByteBuddy class also declares a very large set of dependencies across many package areas, suggesting it centralizes orchestration and cross-cutting concerns. The concentration of size and complexity in a few classes plus the package-level size supports identifying this package as a God Component."
