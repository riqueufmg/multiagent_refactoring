    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class and 16 lines of code, with minimal complexity metrics (low WMC, LOC) and no significant internal or external dependencies (fanin/fanout = 0). Given its very small size and low complexity, it is not excessively large and does not qualify as a God Component."
