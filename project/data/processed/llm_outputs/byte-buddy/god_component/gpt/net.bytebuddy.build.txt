    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package net.bytebuddy.build is excessively large and concentrated: 131 classes and 21,284 LOC. Several enormous compilation units concentrate functionality in this package (e.g. Plugin.java ~4,286 LOC with many inner types, Plugin.Engine ~3,681 LOC, Plugin.Source ~956 LOC, Plugin.Default ~568 LOC, Plugin.Factory ~520 LOC, BuildLogger ~478 LOC). The Plugin class alone defines a large number of nested types and responsibilities, indicating high functional concentration. These metrics (large total LOC, very high class count in one package, multiple individual files with thousands of lines and many inner classes) support that this package behaves as a God Component by centralizing excessive code size and responsibilities."
