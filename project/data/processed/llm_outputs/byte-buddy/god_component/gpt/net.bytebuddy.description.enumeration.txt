    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 4 classes and 254 LOC, which is moderate. The largest class, EnumerationDescription, is 138 LOC but has low complexity (wmc=3, nc=1) and the remaining classes are small (27, 46, 43 LOC). Coupled metrics are low (Ce=3, Ca=7) and there is no evidence of an excessively large number of classes or extreme LOC concentration that would indicate a God Component. Overall size and complexity are not excessive in context."
