    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 97 classes and 7,068 LOC, which is large for a single component and indicates concentration of functionality. Several individual classes are very large and/or complex (examples: Binder.FieldProxy — 683 LOC, wmc 27; TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder — 442 LOC; Binder.Morph — 358 LOC, wmc 14; Binder.Pipe — 291 LOC, wmc 14; DefaultMethod — 154 LOC). Many nested/related binder classes are housed in the same package (numerous Binder.* types and TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder inner types), concentrating responsibilities. The combination of high total LOC, high class count and multiple large, complex classes suggests the package is taking excessive responsibility and qualifies as a God Component."
