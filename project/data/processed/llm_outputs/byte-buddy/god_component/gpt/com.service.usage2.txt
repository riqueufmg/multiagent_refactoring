    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package com.service.usage2 contains a single class (ServiceImplementation) with only 5 LOC, 1 method (nom=1), WMC=1, no fields, no incoming/outgoing dependencies (Ca=0, Ce=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The component is very small in both size and class count and shows low complexity, so it does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
