    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.gradle.api.file",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 42 LOC, with individual class LOC of 26 and 16. Complexity metrics (WMC 4 and 2), lack of many methods, and minimal dependencies indicate the component is small and not excessively large, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
