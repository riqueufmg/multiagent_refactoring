    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 8 classes with a total of 1,284 LOC, but complexity and responsibilities are heavily concentrated in a few very large classes: ClassByImplementation (370 LOC, 32 methods, 29 public methods, WMC=66), ClassByExtension (309 LOC, 23 methods, WMC=25) and SuperClassInvocationBenchmark (265 LOC). Several classes have large method counts and high complexity, indicating concentrated responsibilities rather than being evenly distributed. The package also has Ce=7 (it depends on many external packages) and Ca=0 (no incoming dependencies), suggesting the package is relatively self-contained yet large. Taken together—multiple classes with high LOC, high nominal method counts and high WMC—this supports that the package is excessively large and behaves like a God Component."
