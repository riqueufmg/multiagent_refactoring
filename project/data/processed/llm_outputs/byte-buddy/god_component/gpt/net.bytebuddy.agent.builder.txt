    "justification": "The package net.bytebuddy.agent.builder is excessively large: 229 classes and 34,339 LOC. It contains a very large top-level class AgentBuilder (~9,519 LOC) with many large inner components (AgentBuilder.Default ~2,133 LOC, AgentBuilder.RedefinitionStrategy ~2,097 LOC, AgentBuilder.LambdaInstrumentationStrategy ~1,105 LOC, AgentBuilder.ExecutingTransformer ~484 LOC, plus numerous other inner classes and sizable nested types). The concentration of thousands of LOC and many responsibilities (transformation, dispatching, loading strategies, instrumentation strategies, resubmission, listeners, etc., as reflected by class names) indicates a single component managing excessive functionality and size, consistent with the God Component smell."
