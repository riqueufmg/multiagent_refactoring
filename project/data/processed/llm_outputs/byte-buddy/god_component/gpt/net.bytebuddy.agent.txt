    "justification": "The package net.bytebuddy.agent is excessively large and concentrated: it contains 64 classes and 12,617 LOC. Several very large classes/files concentrate most of the size and responsibility (VirtualMachine ~2449 LOC; ByteBuddyAgent ~1185 LOC; VirtualMachine.ForHotSpot ~1213 LOC; VirtualMachine.ForOpenJ9 ~1121 LOC; VirtualMachine.Connection ~1004 LOC). Many nested/inner classes are declared inside the same files (e.g., many VirtualMachine.* and ByteBuddyAgent.* types), increasing file/class size and responsibility. The main classes also have high complexity indicators (ByteBuddyAgent WMC=47) and many methods/fields (e.g., VirtualMachine nof=70, ByteBuddyAgent nof=35). This combination of high LOC, many classes grouped in a single package/file set, and concentrated complexity supports detecting a God Component."
