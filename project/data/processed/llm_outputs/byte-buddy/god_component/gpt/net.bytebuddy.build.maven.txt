    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 29 classes and 2,303 LOC, with a pronounced concentration in a single class file: ByteBuddyMojo (971 LOC, WMC 38, 37 fields). ByteBuddyMojo alone accounts for ~42% of the package LOC and declares numerous inner types (e.g. Transformer, ForLifecycleTypes, ForProductionTypes, ForConfiguredPlugin, ForDiscoveredPlugin, StalenessFilter, TransformationLogger, MavenBuildLogger, Coordinate, FilePrefixMatcher, etc.), indicating many responsibilities bundled into one component. ByteBuddyMojo also has many external dependencies listed, increasing its coupling and responsibility scope. This imbalance (one very large, complex class dominating the package) supports detection of a God Component."
