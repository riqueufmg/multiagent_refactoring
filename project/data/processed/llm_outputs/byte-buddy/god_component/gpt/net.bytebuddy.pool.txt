    "justification": "The package net.bytebuddy.pool is excessively large: 160 classes and 34,265 LOC. It contains multiple very large classes concentrated in the same component (examples: TypePool ~7,626 LOC; TypePool.Default ~6,861 LOC; TypePool.LazyTypeDescription ~4,392 LOC; TypePool.GenericTypeToken ~1,711 LOC; TypePool.TypeExtractor ~712 LOC). Many nested/inner types are defined within a single source (TypePool.java) and the package aggregates substantial functionality and code volume, indicating an overlarge (God) component."
