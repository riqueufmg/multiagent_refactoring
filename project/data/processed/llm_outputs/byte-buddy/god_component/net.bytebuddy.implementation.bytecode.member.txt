    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 25 classes and 1,737 LOC, indicating substantial size for a single component. Several very large classes concentrate most of the code: MethodInvocation (371 LOC), MethodVariableAccess (309 LOC) and FieldAccess (191 LOC). Multiple inner/embedded types are defined in the same files (e.g., many MethodVariableAccess inner types), increasing class count and file complexity. The combination of high LOC, many classes (including large classes) and clustered responsibilities supports identifying this package as a God Component."
