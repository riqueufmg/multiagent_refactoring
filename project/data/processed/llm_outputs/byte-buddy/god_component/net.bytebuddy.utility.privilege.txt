    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 85 LOC in total, which is small for a component-level God Component. Individual classes have low LOC (22, 39, 24), low complexity (WMC = 2 for each), minimal method counts, and no significant coupling (fan-in/fan-out = 0, Ca = 1, Ce = 1). These metrics indicate the component is modest in size and responsibility, so it does not exhibit the excessive size characteristic of a God Component."
