    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 8 classes with a total of 1284 lines of code, which is not excessively large for a benchmarking module. The largest class, ClassByImplementationBenchmark, has 370 lines of code and 66 methods, which is substantial but not unreasonable for a benchmark class. The package's structure appears to be well-organized around different benchmarking scenarios rather than being a single monolithic component."
