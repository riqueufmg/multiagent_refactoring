    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' contains 143 classes and has a total of 26,076 lines of code, indicating an excessively large component. Key classes such as 'DynamicType' (4,937 LOC), 'DynamicType.Builder' (4,407 LOC), 'ClassFileLocator' (1,670 LOC), and 'Transformer' (473 LOC) contribute significantly to this size. The high number of classes and substantial LOC suggest that the package is handling too many responsibilities, which aligns with the characteristics of a God Component."
