    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes with a total of 812 lines of code. The largest classes are ConstructorStrategy (256 LOC) and ConstructorStrategy.Default (158 LOC), which, while substantial, do not indicate an excessively large component. The package's structure appears modular with distinct responsibilities (e.g., SubclassImplementationTarget, ConstructorStrategy, SubclassDynamicTypeBuilder), and no single class dominates the package in terms of complexity or LOC. The distribution of lines of code and number of classes does not suggest a God Component."
