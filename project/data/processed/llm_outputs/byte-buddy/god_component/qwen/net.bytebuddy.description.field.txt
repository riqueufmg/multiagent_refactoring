    "justification": "The package contains 17 classes with a total of 1418 lines of code. The largest classes are FieldList (217 LOC) and FieldDescription (509 LOC), which, while substantial, are not excessively large given their roles as core descriptive components in a bytecode manipulation library. The code is well-organized into multiple cohesive classes with clear responsibilities, and there is no indication of a single component monopolizing functionality or being excessively large in the context of the system."
