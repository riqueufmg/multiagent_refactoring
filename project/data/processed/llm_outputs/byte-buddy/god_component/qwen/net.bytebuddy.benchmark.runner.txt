    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class (QuickRunner) with 23 lines of code, which is not excessively large in terms of either Lines Of Code or number of classes. The class itself has only 2 methods and minimal complexity, indicating it is a small, focused component rather than a God Component."
