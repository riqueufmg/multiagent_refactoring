    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 28 classes with a total of 1768 lines of code. While the package has a substantial number of classes and LOC, the classes appear to be well-organized and focused on specific bytecode constant implementations (e.g., FloatConstant, IntegerConstant, MethodConstant, etc.). The complexity is distributed across multiple cohesive classes rather than concentrated in a single God Component. The package seems to follow a consistent design pattern for representing different types of constants in bytecode manipulation."
