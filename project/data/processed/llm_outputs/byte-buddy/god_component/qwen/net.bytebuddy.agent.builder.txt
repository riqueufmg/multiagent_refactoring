{
    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.agent.builder' contains 229 classes and 34,339 lines of code, indicating an excessively large component. The class 'AgentBuilder' alone has 9,519 lines of code and 293 fields, further contributing to the god component smell. The high number of classes and LOC at both the package and class levels suggests that the component is handling too many responsibilities and is overly complex."
