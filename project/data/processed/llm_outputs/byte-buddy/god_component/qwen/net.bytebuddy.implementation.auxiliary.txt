    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 26 classes with a total of 1979 lines of code. While the number of classes is relatively high, the LOC per class averages around 76, which is not excessively large. The classes appear to be cohesive and related to auxiliary implementations for bytecode manipulation, without any single class dominating the codebase in terms of size or responsibility. No single component within the package exhibits excessive size or complexity that would indicate a God Component."
