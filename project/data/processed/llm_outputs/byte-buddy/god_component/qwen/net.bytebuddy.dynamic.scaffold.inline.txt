    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 20 classes with a total of 2242 lines of code. While the LOC is substantial, the classes are functionally cohesive and focused on dynamic type scaffolding and inlining mechanisms. No single class dominates the codebase in terms of size or responsibility. The distribution of logic across multiple related classes indicates a well-structured design rather than a god component."
