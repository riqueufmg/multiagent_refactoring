    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes with a total of 675 lines of code, which is not excessively large for a specialized bytecode manipulation library. The classes are cohesive and focused on array and collection operations within the bytecode context. No single class dominates the codebase in terms of size or responsibility, and the complexity is appropriately distributed."
