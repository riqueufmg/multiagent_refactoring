    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.android",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.android' contains a single dominant class 'AndroidClassLoadingStrategy' with 654 lines of code and 29 fields, making it excessively large. The class also includes multiple nested static classes (e.g., DexProcessor, ForSdkCompiler, Injecting, etc.) that contribute to its complexity and size. The total package LOC is 2012 with 17 classes, but the primary class dominates the codebase in terms of size and responsibility, indicating a God Component smell."
