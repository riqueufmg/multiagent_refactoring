    "package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes with a total of 238 lines of code. The largest class, Assigner, has 95 lines of code and 7 nested classes, but this is not excessively large given the nature of the functionality (type assignment logic). The other classes are significantly smaller, with most under 40 lines of code. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable for a package handling bytecode assignment operations, and no single class dominates the codebase in terms of size or complexity."
