    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.agent' contains 64 classes with a total of 12,617 lines of code. Two main classes, 'ByteBuddyAgent' (1,185 LOC) and 'VirtualMachine' (2,449 LOC), are excessively large and encapsulate numerous nested classes and extensive functionality, indicating a concentration of responsibilities. The high number of classes and LOC in a single package, combined with the presence of dominant classes that implement core functionalities, suggests the package acts as a God Component by centralizing too much logic and responsibility."
