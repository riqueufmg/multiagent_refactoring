    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 12 classes with a total of 959 lines of code. While the package has a moderate number of classes and LOC, the individual classes are relatively small and focused, with none exceeding 235 LOC (PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate) and most being under 100 LOC. The complexity as measured by WMC is also distributed reasonably across the classes. There is no single class or component that dominates the codebase in terms of size or complexity, which would be indicative of a God Component."
