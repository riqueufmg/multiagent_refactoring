    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 118 classes and has a total of 14,892 lines of code, indicating an excessively large component. Key classes such as PackageDefinitionStrategy (547 LOC), ByteArrayClassLoader (1,127 LOC), ClassInjector (2,245 LOC), and ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator (407 LOC) contribute significantly to the size and complexity, suggesting the package is handling too many responsibilities."
