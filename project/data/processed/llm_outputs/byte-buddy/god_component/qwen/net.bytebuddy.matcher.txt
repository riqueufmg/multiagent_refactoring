    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 73 classes with a total of 5083 lines of code. The class ElementMatchers alone has 198 methods and 1785 lines of code, indicating excessive size and responsibility. The high number of classes and the presence of one dominant class suggest the package is overly large and complex, exhibiting characteristics of a God Component."
