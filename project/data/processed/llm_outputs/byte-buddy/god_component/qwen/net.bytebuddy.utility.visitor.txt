    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes with a total of 993 lines of code. While some individual classes like StackAwareMethodVisitor (318 LOC) and ExceptionTableSensitiveMethodVisitor (237 LOC) are substantial, the overall package size and class distribution do not indicate an excessively large component. The complexity is reasonably distributed across multiple cohesive classes, each serving distinct purposes within the visitor pattern implementation."
