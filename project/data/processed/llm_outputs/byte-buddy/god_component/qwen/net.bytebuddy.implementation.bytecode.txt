    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 27 classes with a total of 1514 lines of code. While the number of classes is relatively high, the classes appear to be cohesive and focused on bytecode manipulation functionalities. The package has a high afferent coupling (22) and low efferent coupling (4), indicating it is widely used but not overly dependent on other packages. The distribution of responsibilities seems合理的 for a specialized domain like bytecode generation, and there's no indication of excessive size or responsibility concentration that would characterize a God Component."
