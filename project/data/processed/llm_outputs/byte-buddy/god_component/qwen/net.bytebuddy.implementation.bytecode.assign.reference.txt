    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes with a total of 976 lines of code. While the GenericTypeAwareAssigner class is relatively large (360 LOC), the code is well-structured into multiple cohesive classes, each handling specific responsibilities within type assignment. The presence of nested classes under GenericTypeAwareAssigner indicates a deliberate design to encapsulate related functionality rather than centralizing all logic into a single God Component."
