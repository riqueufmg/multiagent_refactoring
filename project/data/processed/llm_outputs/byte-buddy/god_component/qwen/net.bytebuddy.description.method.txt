    "package": "net.bytebuddy.description.method",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 53 classes with a total of 7252 lines of code, indicating excessive size. The class MethodDescription alone has 1695 lines of code and 35 fields, showing high complexity and responsibility. Multiple large classes such as ParameterDescription (899 LOC, 33 fields) and several other classes with significant LOC and field counts suggest the package is handling too much functionality, violating the single responsibility principle."
