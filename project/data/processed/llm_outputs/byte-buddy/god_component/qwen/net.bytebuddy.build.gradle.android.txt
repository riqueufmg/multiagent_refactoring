    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 37 classes with a total of 2856 lines of code, indicating a high level of complexity and responsibility. Several classes within the package are excessively large in terms of lines of code and number of fields or methods, such as ByteBuddyAndroidService (292 loc, 10 fields), ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin (528 loc, 24 fields), and ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask (313 loc, 6 fields). The high class count and cumulative size suggest the package is handling too many responsibilities, which aligns with the characteristics of a God Component."
