    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 49 classes with a total of 9225 lines of code, indicating excessive size. The AnnotationValue class alone comprises 2457 lines of code and includes numerous nested classes, which suggests it is handling too many responsibilities. The high number of classes and the large size of individual classes like AnnotationValue and AnnotationDescription (1151 LOC) with many nested components are key indicators of a God Component."
