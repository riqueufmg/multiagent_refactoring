    "justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind' contains 32 classes with a total of 2628 lines of code. The class 'MethodDelegationBinder' alone has 777 lines of code and 28 fields, indicating high complexity and responsibility. The large number of classes and significant LOC suggest that the package is handling too much functionality, which aligns with the characteristics of a God Component."
