    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 59 classes and 11019 lines of code, which is not excessively large for a generated benchmark package. The classes are mostly small JMH-generated benchmarks with low complexity (most have 0 methods and low LOC). There is no single class or component that dominates the codebase in terms of size or responsibility. The structure appears to be a collection of related but separate benchmark tests rather than a single God Component."
