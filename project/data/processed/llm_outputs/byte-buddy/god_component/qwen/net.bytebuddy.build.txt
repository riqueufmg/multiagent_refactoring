    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.build",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.build' contains 131 classes and has a total of 21,284 lines of code, which indicates it is excessively large in terms of both the number of classes and lines of code. The presence of a single class 'Plugin' with 4,286 lines of code and numerous nested classes further supports the detection of a God Component, as it centralizes a vast amount of functionality within one component."
