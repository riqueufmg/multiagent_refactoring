    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.description.type' contains 175 classes and has a total of 33,551 lines of code, which is excessively large. The high number of classes and LOC indicates that the package is handling too many responsibilities, suggesting the presence of a God Component. Additionally, the package has a high efferent coupling (Ce=16) and afferent coupling (Ca=32), further supporting the claim that it is a central, overly complex component within the system."
