    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 29 classes with a total of 2303 lines of code. The class ByteBuddyMojo is excessively large with 971 lines of code and 37 fields, indicating it accumulates too much responsibility. Multiple inner classes are defined within ByteBuddyMojo, suggesting a lack of proper decomposition. The package-level complexity and class size indicate a violation of the single responsibility principle."
