    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 42 classes with a total of 3915 lines of code, indicating excessive size. Several classes within the package are also large and complex, such as AbstractByteBuddyTask (474 LOC, WMC 50), AbstractByteBuddyTaskExtension (360 LOC, WMC 41), and ByteBuddyPlugin (314 LOC). The high number of classes and substantial LOC at both package and class levels suggest the presence of a God Component."
