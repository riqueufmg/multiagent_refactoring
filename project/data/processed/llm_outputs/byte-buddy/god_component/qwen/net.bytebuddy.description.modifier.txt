    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 27 classes with a total of 1317 lines of code. While the number of classes is relatively high, the classes are small and focused, each representing a specific modifier concept (e.g., Visibility, SynchronizationState, FieldManifestation). The largest class, ModifierContributor, has 204 lines of code and includes several inner classes, but this is reasonable given its role as a central contributor to modifier functionality. The overall structure reflects a well-organized domain-specific package rather than a God Component."
