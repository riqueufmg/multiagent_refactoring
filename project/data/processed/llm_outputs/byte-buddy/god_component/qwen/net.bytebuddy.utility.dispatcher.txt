    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class JavaDispatcher with 1180 LOC and 32 fields, making it excessively large. The package also contains 19 classes in total with 2788 LOC, indicating the package itself is large. The JavaDispatcher class contains multiple nested classes and has high complexity with 51 WMC, showing it handles too many responsibilities. The package-level metrics and the dominant size of the JavaDispatcher class indicate a God Component smell."
