    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 25 classes with a total of 1737 lines of code. While the LOC count is moderately high, the classes are functionally cohesive and organized around bytecode member operations (e.g., MethodVariableAccess, FieldAccess, MethodInvocation). The complexity is distributed across multiple specialized classes rather than concentrated in a single excessively large component. No single class dominates the package in terms of size or responsibility."
