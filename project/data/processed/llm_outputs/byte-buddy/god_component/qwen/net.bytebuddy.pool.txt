{
    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.pool",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.pool' contains 160 classes and has a total of 34,265 lines of code. The class 'TypePool' alone comprises 7,626 lines of code and declares 411 fields, indicating excessive size and complexity. The large number of classes and the substantial LOC at both the package and class level suggest that the component is excessively large, fulfilling the criteria for the God Component smell."
