    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 23 classes and 2,300 LOC, indicating a large component. Several classes are very large and concentrated in the same package/file: ModuleDescription is 931 LOC, ForLoadedModule is 421 LOC, ModuleDescriptor is 157 LOC and Latent is 142 LOC. The LOC-to-class ratio and the presence of a single class approaching 1,000 LOC (plus multiple substantial inner/related classes in the same compilation unit) suggest that responsibilities are concentrated and the component is excessively large, consistent with the God Component smell."
