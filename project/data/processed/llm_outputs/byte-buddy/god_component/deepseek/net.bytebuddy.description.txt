    "justification": "Package contains 28 classes and 1656 LOC, but individual classes are relatively small (average ~59 LOC) with focused responsibilities like NamedElement, TypeVariableSource, ModifierReviewable, and ByteCodeElement. The total size is moderate for a core package in a bytecode manipulation library, and no single component shows excessive complexity or lines of code."
