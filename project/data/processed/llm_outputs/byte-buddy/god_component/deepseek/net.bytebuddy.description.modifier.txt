    "justification": "Package has 27 classes with total 1317 LOC, but all classes are small (average ~49 LOC) and focused on a single responsibility (modifier definitions), with high cohesion and no single overly dominant class; overall size is manageable for a utility package in a bytecode manipulation framework."
