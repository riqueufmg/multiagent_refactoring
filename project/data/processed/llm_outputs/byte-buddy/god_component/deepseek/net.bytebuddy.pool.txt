    "justification": "The package contains 160 classes and 34,265 lines of code, which is excessively large. Multiple inner classes within TypePool.java have very high LOC (e.g., TypePool 7,626, TypePool.Default 6,861, TypePool.GenericTypeToken 1,711) and field counts, indicating the component centralizes numerous responsibilities."
