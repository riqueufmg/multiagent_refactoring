    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.description.method",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Package contains 53 classes with 7252 total LOC, indicating excessive size. Multiple large individual classes exist, including MethodDescription (1695 LOC, 35 fields, 29 methods) and ParameterDescription (899 LOC, 33 fields, 5 methods). The high class count and substantial cumulative lines of code suggest the package has too many responsibilities concentrated in one component."
