    "justification": "Package has 42 classes and 3915 LOC, which is moderate for a complex Gradle plugin module. Individual classes like AbstractByteBuddyTask (474 LOC, 32 methods) and AbstractByteBuddyTaskExtension (360 LOC, 38 methods) are substantial but not excessively large relative to the plugin's responsibilities. The codebase shows logical distribution across specialized classes with clear inheritance hierarchies, and no single component dominates excessively in size or responsibility."
