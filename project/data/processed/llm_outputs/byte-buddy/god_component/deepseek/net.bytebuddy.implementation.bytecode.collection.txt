    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes and 675 lines of code, which is moderate for a specialized utility component. The largest individual class (ArrayFactory) has only 235 lines, and the class-level metrics indicate focused responsibilities with low method counts and limited dependencies, not suggesting excessive size or overwhelming complexity."
