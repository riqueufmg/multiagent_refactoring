    "justification": "Package contains 26 classes with total 1979 LOC, distributed across multiple focused classes with reasonable individual sizes (most under 100 LOC). While moderately sized, the package shows good decomposition with specialized classes for auxiliary type implementations rather than a single monolithic component."
