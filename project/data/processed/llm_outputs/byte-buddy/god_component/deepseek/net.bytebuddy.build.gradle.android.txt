    "justification": "Package has 37 classes and 2856 LOC, which is moderately sized for a Gradle plugin package. The largest class (ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin at 528 LOC) contains multiple inner classes that decompose its responsibilities, and no single class appears excessively large or complex beyond typical plugin patterns."
