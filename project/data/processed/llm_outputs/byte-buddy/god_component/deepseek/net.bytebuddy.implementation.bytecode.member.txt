    "justification": "The package contains 25 classes but with a moderate total LOC of 1737, averaging about 69 lines per class. Many classes are small inner classes focused on specific bytecode operations, and the package's cohesion is evident in its narrow responsibility for member access and invocation. The number of classes and LOC is not excessive given the low-level bytecode manipulation domain."
