    "justification": "The package contains 19 classes and 2788 LOC, which is moderate for a utility package. While one class (JavaDispatcher) is large (1180 LOC), it appears to be a main dispatcher class with multiple inner classes, which is a common design pattern for such components. The overall size and structure do not indicate excessive complexity."
