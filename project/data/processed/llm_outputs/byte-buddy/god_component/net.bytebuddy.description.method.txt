    "justification": "The package contains 53 classes and 7,252 LOC, indicating a very large component. Several individual classes are extremely large and feature-rich (e.g. MethodDescription ~1,695 LOC, 29 methods, WMC 29; ParameterDescription ~899 LOC; ParameterList ~505 LOC; plus multiple large inner/auxiliary types), and many responsibilities are co-located in the same package/file (multiple nested types within MethodDescription/ParameterDescription). Coupled with significant incoming/outgoing coupling (Ca=26, Ce=11) making it central to other code, the package exhibits excessive size and concentrated responsibility consistent with a God Component smell."
