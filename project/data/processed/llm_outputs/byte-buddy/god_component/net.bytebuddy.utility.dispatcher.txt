    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 19 classes and 2,788 LOC with heavy concentration in a single component: JavaDispatcher (1,180 LOC, WMC=51) that also declares many nested types (InvokerCreationAction, DirectInvoker, Dispatcher, ForDefaultValue, DynamicClassLoader, Resolver, etc.). Several other large types in the same package (Dispatcher: 501 LOC, ForDefaultValue: 253 LOC, DynamicClassLoader: 244 LOC) indicate multiple large responsibilities co-located. The combination of very large class/file size, high complexity (WMC) and multiple sizeable nested/related classes supports detecting a God Component in this package."
