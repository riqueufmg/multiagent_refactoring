    "justification": "The package net.bytebuddy.dynamic is excessively large: 143 classes and 26,076 LOC at package level. It contains multiple very large types concentrating functionality (examples: DynamicType ~4,937 LOC, DynamicType.Builder ~4,407 LOC, DynamicType.AbstractBase variants totaling ~1,970 LOC, ClassFileLocator ~1,670 LOC, DynamicType.Adapter ~1,214 LOC) plus many additional inner/adaptor classes. The size is concentrated in a few huge classes and many nested/related classes, indicating a single component responsible for many concerns (type building, class-file location, loading/injection, scaffolding and many adapters). These elements together justify detecting a God Component smell."
