    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (Provider) with only 18 LOC and low complexity (WMC=2, nom=2). There is only one class in the package (num_classes=1) and no signs of aggregation of many classes or very large source size. Coupling is minimal (Ce=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) and metrics do not indicate an excessively large component, so this package does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
