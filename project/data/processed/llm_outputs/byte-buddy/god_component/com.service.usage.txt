    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.service.usage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class and only 5 LOC (num_classes=1, loc=5). Class metrics are very small (wmc=1, nom=1, nopm=1, loc=5) and there are no incoming/outgoing dependencies (Ca=0, Ce=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). These indicators show the component is minimal in size and responsibility, so it does not exhibit a God Component smell."
