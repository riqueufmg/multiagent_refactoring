    "justification": "Package 'com.service.definition' contains a single class (num_classes=1) with only 3 LOC. Class metrics show low complexity (wmc=1), no fanin/fanout, and no incoming/outgoing package dependencies (Ca=0, Ce=0). There is no evidence of excessive size in terms of lines of code or number of classes, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
