    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 20 classes totaling 2,242 LOC, indicating a large component surface. Several classes concentrate much of that size and complexity: MethodRebaseResolver (425 LOC), MethodRebaseResolver.Resolution (305 LOC) and DecoratingDynamicTypeBuilder (323 LOC, WMC=36, 36 methods) are notably large and complex. The package groups multiple responsibilities (builders, resolvers, implementation targets, matchers) and many nested/inner types, suggesting responsibility concentration. Coupling metrics (Ce=20, Ca=8) show the package has many outgoing and incoming dependencies, reinforcing its central, heavy role. Taken together — high total LOC, multiple very large classes, concentrated complexity and coupling — these elements support detection of a God Component."
