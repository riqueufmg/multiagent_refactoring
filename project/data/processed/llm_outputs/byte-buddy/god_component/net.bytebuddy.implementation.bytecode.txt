    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 27 classes and 1,514 LOC, which is moderate in size and does not indicate an excessively large component. The LOC is distributed: the largest class (StackManipulation) is 209 LOC (~13.8% of package LOC) and the next largest classes (Duplication 134 LOC, ByteCodeAppender 131 LOC, StackSize 111 LOC) together do not dominate the package. Many classes are small (around 30–60 LOC), showing decomposition of responsibilities rather than a single monolith. The package is cohesive (all classes relate to bytecode implementation) and coupling (Ca=22, Ce=4) is consistent with a core utility package rather than evidence of a god component. Based on this contextual assessment (without fixed thresholds), the package does not exhibit the God Component smell."
