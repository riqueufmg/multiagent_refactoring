    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
