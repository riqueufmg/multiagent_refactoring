    "justification": "InstrumentableMatcher has a small number of direct relationships: 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher) and 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.SubclassDynamicTypeBuilder). The total set of distinct connected abstractions is 3, which is not a large number and therefore does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell. (While the outgoing targets themselves reference many other types, the analysis of this class in isolation shows only two direct outgoing and one direct incoming dependency.)"
