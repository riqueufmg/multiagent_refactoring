    "justification": "The analyzed class has only one explicit outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and only one incoming dependency source in the provided data (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant). Although those related classes (JavaDispatcher and JavaConstant) themselves reference many other types, the analyzed class itself does not show a large number of direct incoming or outgoing relationships; therefore it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
