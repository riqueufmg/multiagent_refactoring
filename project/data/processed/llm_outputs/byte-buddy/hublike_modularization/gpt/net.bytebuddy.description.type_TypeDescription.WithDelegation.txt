    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, and net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, but it has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; the absence of incoming dependencies means this class does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
