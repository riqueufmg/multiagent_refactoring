    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StackAwareMethodVisitor has four outgoing dependencies (OpenedClassReader, MethodDescription, StackSize, AccessControllerPlugin) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing is small (4), so the hub-like smell is not present."
