    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForParameterizedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. Incoming dependencies are empty (incoming_dependencies: []), and it has only two direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList). A hub-like smell requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; here the incoming count is zero and the direct outgoing count is only 2, so the class is not a hub."
