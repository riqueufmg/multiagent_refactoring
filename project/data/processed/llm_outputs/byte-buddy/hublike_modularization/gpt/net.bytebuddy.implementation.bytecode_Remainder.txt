    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Remainder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Remainder has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; the provided data shows a small number of outgoing links and no incoming links, so the smell is not present."
