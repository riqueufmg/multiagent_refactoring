    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. For this class: incoming_dependencies is empty (no incoming dependencies). Outgoing dependencies list contains only two direct targets: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList. Although TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, the analysis must consider the class in isolation; the class under analysis has only 2 outgoing edges and 0 incoming edges, so it does not meet the 'hub' criteria."
