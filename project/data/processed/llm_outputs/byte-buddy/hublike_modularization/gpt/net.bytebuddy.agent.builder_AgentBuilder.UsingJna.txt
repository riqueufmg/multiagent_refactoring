    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. AgentBuilder.UsingJna has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). Although ClassInjector (the single outgoing target) has many dependencies itself (27 listed), UsingJna’s direct dependency degree is low and it has no incoming links, so it does not qualify as a hub."
