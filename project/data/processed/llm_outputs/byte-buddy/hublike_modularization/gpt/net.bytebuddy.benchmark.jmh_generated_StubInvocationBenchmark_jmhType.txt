    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 5 incoming dependencies (from StubInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkJavassist_jmhTest, StubInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkByteBuddy_jmhTest, StubInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkCglib_jmhTest, StubInvocationBenchmark_baseline_jmhTest, StubInvocationBenchmark_benchmarkJdkProxy_jmhTest) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; since outgoing dependencies are absent, this class does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
