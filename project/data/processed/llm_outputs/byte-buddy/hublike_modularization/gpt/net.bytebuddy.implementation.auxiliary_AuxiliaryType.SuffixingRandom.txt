    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.utility.RandomString. Because there are no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing links, it does not meet the 'hub-like' pattern. (Note: the many dependencies of HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin are not incoming dependencies of this class and therefore do not make it a hub.)"
