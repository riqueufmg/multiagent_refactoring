    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number on either side (incoming = 0, outgoing = 3), so the smell is not detected."
