    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodReturn",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a small set of outgoing dependencies on core types (4): net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition. More importantly, it is referenced by a large number of other abstractions (49 distinct incoming dependents), including high-level and widely used classes such as net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation (and many of its nested/related types), net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall, net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder, net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.MethodCallProxy, and many Implementation-derived appenders and adapters. The combination of many incoming references (numerous callers across the codebase) together with dependencies on several core types indicates a hub-like modularization smell: MethodReturn acts as a central hub interacting with a large number of other abstractions."
