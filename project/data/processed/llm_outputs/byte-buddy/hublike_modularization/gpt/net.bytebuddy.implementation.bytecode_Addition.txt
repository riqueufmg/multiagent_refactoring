    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Addition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Addition has a moderate number of incoming dependencies (8 distinct classes reference it: net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice; net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OffsetMapping; net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Target; net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ReadWrite; net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForVariable; net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForField; net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod; net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.Appender) but only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize). The hub-like smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; Addition exhibits many incoming links but only few outgoing links, so it is not a hub-like modularization."
