    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender.OnRecordComponent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists 16 dependencies, the analyzed class itself directly depends on a single abstraction and has no incoming links, so it is not a hub."
