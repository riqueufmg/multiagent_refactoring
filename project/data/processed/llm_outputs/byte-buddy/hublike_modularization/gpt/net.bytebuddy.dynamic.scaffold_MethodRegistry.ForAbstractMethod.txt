    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided counts are low. (Although the two outgoing targets list many of their own dependencies, this class itself directly depends on only two abstractions and has no incoming links, so it is not a hub.)"
