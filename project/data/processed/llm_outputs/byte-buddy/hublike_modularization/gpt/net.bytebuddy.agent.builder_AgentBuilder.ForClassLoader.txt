    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator. It has one incoming dependent class: net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder (listed as depending on AgentBuilder.ForClassLoader). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
