    "justification": "QueueFactory has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, net.bytebuddy.utility.QueueFactory.Dispatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin) but has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies (high fan-in and fan-out). Given the absence of incoming dependencies and only four outgoing links, the hub-like smell is not detected."
