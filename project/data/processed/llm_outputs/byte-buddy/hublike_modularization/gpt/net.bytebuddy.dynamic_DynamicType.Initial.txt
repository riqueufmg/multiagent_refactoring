    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition (2 distinct outgoing). Incoming dependencies: only net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType references this class (1 distinct incoming). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. In isolation, DynamicType.Initial shows a low number of incoming (1) and outgoing (2) relationships, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
