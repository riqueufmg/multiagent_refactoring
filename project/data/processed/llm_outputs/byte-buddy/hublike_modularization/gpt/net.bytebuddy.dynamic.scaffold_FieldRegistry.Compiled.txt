    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 7 (net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldRegistry, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Incoming dependencies: 1 (only referenced by net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldRegistry). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relations; here outgoing degree is moderate but incoming degree is minimal. Although some outgoing targets (e.g., TypeWriter, TypeDescription) themselves have large dependency graphs, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of incoming dependents and therefore does not meet the hub-like criterion."
