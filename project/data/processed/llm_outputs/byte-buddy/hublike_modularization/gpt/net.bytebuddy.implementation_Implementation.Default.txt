    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (19 distinct outgoing abstractions: TypeInitializer, MethodReturn, ParameterList, AuxiliaryType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AnnotationValue, Visibility, StackManipulation, TypeList, Implementation, TypeWriter, MethodDescription, AnnotationValueFilter, ByteCodeAppender, TypeDescription, ParameterDescription, ClassFileVersion, AnnotationList, FieldDescription) but zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies means this class is not a hub."
