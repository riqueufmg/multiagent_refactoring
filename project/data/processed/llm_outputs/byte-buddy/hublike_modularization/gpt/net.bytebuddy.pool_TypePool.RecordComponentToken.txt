    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming couplings and therefore does not meet the smell criteria."
