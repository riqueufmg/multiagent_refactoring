    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodReturn, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and a single incoming dependency entry (from net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). A hub-like modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships; here both incoming (1) and outgoing (4) counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
