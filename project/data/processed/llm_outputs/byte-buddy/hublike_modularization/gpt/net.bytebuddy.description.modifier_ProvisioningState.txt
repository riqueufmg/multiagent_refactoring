    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ProvisioningState",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ProvisioningState has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor) and only 2 incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable and net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase). A hub-like modularization would require the abstraction to have dependencies to and from a large number of other abstractions. Although the incoming classes reference many modifier types, ProvisioningState itself does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing connections (1 outgoing, 2 incoming), so it is not a hub."
