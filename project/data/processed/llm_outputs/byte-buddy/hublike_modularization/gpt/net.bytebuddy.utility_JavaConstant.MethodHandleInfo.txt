    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant). Outgoing dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction itself to have many incoming and outgoing relationships with many other abstractions. Although the referenced neighbors (JavaConstant and JavaDispatcher) have many dependencies, the analyzed class has only a single incoming and a single outgoing dependency, so it does not exhibit a hub-like coupling pattern."
