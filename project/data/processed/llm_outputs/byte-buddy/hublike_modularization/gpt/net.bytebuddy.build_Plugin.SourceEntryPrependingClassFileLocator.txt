    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.SourceEntryPrependingClassFileLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.StreamDrainer, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing links. Given incoming = 0 and a small number of outgoing dependencies, it does not qualify. (Analysis performed in isolation; dependencies of the referenced classes are not counted toward this class's incoming/outgoing.)"
