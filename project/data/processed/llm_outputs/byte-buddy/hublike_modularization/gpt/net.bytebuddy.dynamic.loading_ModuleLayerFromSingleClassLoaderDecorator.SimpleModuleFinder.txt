    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited to 3 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.ConstructorStrategy, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, and net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher. Incoming dependencies are from a single abstraction: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator (one incoming source). Because the class has only a small number of outgoing connections (3) and only one incoming dependent, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
