Outgoing dependencies: only two direct dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher. Although those outgoing classes reference many other types, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing connections (0 incoming, 2 outgoing), so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
