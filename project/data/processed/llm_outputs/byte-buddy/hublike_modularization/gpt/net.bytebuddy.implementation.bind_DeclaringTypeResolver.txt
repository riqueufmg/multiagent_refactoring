    "justification": "DeclaringTypeResolver has only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder) and only 2 direct incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.AmbiguityResolver). These are a small, focused set of relationships (mostly within the same package and related descriptor/benign binder classes), not a large number of incoming and outgoing connections required to classify it as a hub-like modularization."
