    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForInstrumentedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ForInstrumentedType is not hub-like: it has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies: []) and only a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing ties to many other abstractions. Although the incoming class (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) lists many dependencies, those are dependencies of Advice, not multiple direct incoming/outgoing relations for ForInstrumentedType. Per the provided data and the requirement to analyze the class in isolation, the criteria for a hub are not met."
