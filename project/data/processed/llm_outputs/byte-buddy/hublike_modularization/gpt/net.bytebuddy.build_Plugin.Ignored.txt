    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Ignored",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Plugin.Ignored has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit that. Note: TypeDescription (the single outgoing dependency) itself lists many dependencies, but those are not direct dependencies of Plugin.Ignored and are not considered when analyzing the class in isolation."
