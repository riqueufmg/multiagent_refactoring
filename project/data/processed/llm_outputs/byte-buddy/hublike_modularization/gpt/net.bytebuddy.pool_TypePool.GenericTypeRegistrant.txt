    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader) and only one incoming dependent class (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here both counts are low (1 outgoing, 1 incoming), so the smell is not present."
