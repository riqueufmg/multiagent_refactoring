    "class": "net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy.PrefixingRandom",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.RandomString) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections. Although HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself lists many other types, those are dependencies of the outgoing dependency, not direct incoming/outgoing links of the analyzed class. Given the low outgoing count (2) and no incoming links, this is not a hub."
