    "justification": "The class has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (12 distinct abstractions: TypeList, RecordComponentDescription, MethodDescription, FieldList, MethodList, RecordComponentList, CachedReturnPlugin, FieldDescription, AnnotationList, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AnnotationSource, TypeDescription) but only a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing connections; here incoming connections are minimal (1), so the hub smell is not present."
