    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 15 distinct abstractions (Assigner, ConstantValue, TypeDefinition, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, ParameterDescription, FieldLocator, ParameterList, MethodCall, FieldDescription, InstrumentedType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation, TypeDescription, NullConstant). Incoming dependencies: only 1 abstraction (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). Hub-like modularization requires both high incoming and high outgoing coupling; here the outgoing degree is moderate but the incoming degree is very low (1), so the class is not acting as a hub."
