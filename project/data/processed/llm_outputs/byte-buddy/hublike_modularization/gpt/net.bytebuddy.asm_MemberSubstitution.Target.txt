    "justification": "MemberSubstitution.Target has 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution) and 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement). The counts of incoming and outgoing direct relations are small and do not constitute a hub:Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Transitive/deeper dependency lists of the referenced classes are present in the input but, per the isolation constraint, do not make MemberSubstitution.Target itself a hub."
