    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForByteArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Here, incoming_dependencies is empty and outgoing_dependencies contains a single entry, so the criterion is not met. (Note: the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many of its own dependencies, but the analyzed class itself only depends on that one class.)"
