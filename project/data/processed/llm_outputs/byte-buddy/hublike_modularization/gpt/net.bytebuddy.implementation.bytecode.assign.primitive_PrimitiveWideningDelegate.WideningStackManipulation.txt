    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 3, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
