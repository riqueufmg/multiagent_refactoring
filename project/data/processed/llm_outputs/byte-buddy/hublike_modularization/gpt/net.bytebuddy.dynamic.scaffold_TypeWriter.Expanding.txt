    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. For net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Expanding, outgoing_dependencies is empty and incoming_dependencies contains only one referring class (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter). Although TypeWriter has many dependencies, those are not listed as dependencies of Expanding. Therefore Expanding does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies and is not a hub."
