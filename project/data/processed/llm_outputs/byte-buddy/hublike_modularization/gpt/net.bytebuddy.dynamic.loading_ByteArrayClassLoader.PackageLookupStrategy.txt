    "justification": "Direct incoming dependencies: only one class (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader) lists ByteArrayClassLoader.PackageLookupStrategy. Direct outgoing dependencies: only one dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) is listed for the class. Although the outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) has many of its own dependencies, those are transitive and not direct dependencies of PackageLookupStrategy. Given the low number of direct incoming and outgoing connections, this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
