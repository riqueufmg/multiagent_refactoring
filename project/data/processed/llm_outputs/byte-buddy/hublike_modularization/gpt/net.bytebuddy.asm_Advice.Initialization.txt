    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []), and only a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice. Although net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice references many types, Advice.Initialization itself does not exhibit both many incoming and many outgoing relationships required for a Hub-like Modularization smell."
