    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StackSize has a large number of incoming dependencies (it is referenced by many classes across packages, e.g. net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Addition, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess, etc.), indicating it is widely used. However, its outgoing dependencies are minimal — only net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition are listed as its dependencies. Because Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming AND many outgoing dependencies, StackSize does not meet the definition (many incoming but only two outgoing), so the smell is not detected."
