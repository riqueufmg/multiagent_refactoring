Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows a single incoming and a single outgoing connection. (The expanded dependency list for net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant shows many transitive dependencies, but those are not listed as direct outgoing dependencies of MemberSubstitution.NoOp in the provided data.)"
