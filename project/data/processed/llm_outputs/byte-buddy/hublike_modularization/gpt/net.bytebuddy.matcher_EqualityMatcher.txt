    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.EqualityMatcher",

    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Under the provided data and considering the class in isolation, it does not meet the 'large number' criterion for incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
