    "justification": "Advice.Access has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. Although the outgoing dependency classes list many of their own dependencies, those are transitive and not direct dependencies of Advice.Access. Based on the provided data (1 incoming, 2 outgoing), Advice.Access does not exhibit a hub-like coupling pattern."
