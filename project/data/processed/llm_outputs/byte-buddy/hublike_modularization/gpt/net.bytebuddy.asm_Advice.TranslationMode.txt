    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and/or outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Although that incoming class references many other types, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.TranslationMode itself is referenced by a single class and does not exhibit a large number of incoming/outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
