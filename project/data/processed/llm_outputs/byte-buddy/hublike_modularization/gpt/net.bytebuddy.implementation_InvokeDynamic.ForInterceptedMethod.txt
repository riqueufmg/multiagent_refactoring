    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForInterceptedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency source (net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the incoming class lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links for ForInterceptedMethod in the provided data, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
