    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_jmhType) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; these counts (outgoing=1, incoming=0) do not meet that criterion."
