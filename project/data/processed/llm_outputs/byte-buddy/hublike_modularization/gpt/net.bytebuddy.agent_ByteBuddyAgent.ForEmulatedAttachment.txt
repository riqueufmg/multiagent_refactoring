    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.ForEmulatedAttachment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine, and only one incoming dependency recorded: from net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent. Although net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine itself depends on many types, those are not direct dependencies of ByteBuddyAgent.ForEmulatedAttachment. Therefore the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization (it is not directly connected to a large number of other abstractions)."
