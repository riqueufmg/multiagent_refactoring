    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing ties; in isolation this class does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies, so it is not a hub."
