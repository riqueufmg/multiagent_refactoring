    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: five direct targets — net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. Although several of the outgoing targets themselves reference many other abstractions, the analyzed class has no incoming dependencies and only five direct outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
