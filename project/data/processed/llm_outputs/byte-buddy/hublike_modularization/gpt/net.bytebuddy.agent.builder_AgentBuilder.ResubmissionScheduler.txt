    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, listed in analyzed_package.dependencies and outgoing_dependencies) and only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, shown in incoming_dependencies). Both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are minimal (1 each), so it does not act as a hub connecting a large number of other abstractions."
