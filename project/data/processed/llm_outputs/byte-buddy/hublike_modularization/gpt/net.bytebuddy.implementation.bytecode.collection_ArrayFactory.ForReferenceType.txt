    "justification": "Not detected. The class has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the incoming_dependencies list is empty and the outgoing count is small, so this class is not a hub."
