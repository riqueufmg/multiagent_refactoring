    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the analyzed class lacks incoming dependencies, so the condition is not met. (The referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin has many of its own dependencies, but that does not make the analyzed class a hub.)"
