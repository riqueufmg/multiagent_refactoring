    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender.Target",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a very small number of direct relationships: a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender and a single outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin (the single outgoing target) itself references many other types, the analyzed class's direct incoming/outgoing degree is low (1 incoming, 1 outgoing), so it does not qualify as a hub."
