    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. In this data the class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). Although DynamicType lists many dependencies, that reflects the incoming class's own relations; OpensDefinition itself has only one incoming link and no outgoing links, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
