    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Openness",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Openness has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor) and only two incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable and net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase). Although those incoming classes reference many modifier types, Openness itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (outgoing = 1, incoming = 2), so it does not qualify as hub-like modularization."
