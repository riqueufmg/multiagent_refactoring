    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires the abstraction itself to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not satisfy that (outgoing count = 2, incoming count = 0)."
