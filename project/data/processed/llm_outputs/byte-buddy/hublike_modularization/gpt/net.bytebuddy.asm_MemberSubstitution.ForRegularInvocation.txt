    "justification": "Incoming dependency count is low (1 incoming: net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Outgoing dependency count is modest (5 outgoing: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not meet that criterion (incoming=1, outgoing=5)."
