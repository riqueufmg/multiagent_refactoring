Outgoing dependencies: 5 (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has outgoing links but no incoming links, so it does not qualify as a hub in isolation."
