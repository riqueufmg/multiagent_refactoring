    "justification": "ClassInjector.Target has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet those criteria."
