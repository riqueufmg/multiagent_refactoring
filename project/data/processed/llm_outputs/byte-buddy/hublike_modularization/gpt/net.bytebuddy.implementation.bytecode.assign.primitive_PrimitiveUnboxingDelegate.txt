    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies (8): Assigner, TypeDefinition, PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate.UnboxingResponsible (inner), StackSize, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation, TypeDescription, PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate.ExplicitlyTypedUnboxingResponsible (inner). Incoming dependencies (2): PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate.ExplicitlyTypedUnboxingResponsible and PrimitiveTypeAwareAssigner. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing set is moderate and the incoming set is small (2), so this class does not exhibit a hub-like dependency profile."
