    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.EntryPoint.Unvalidated",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "EntryPoint.Unvalidated has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.build.EntryPoint, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeValidation, and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although some of its outgoing targets (e.g., DynamicType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) themselves reference many types, EntryPoint.Unvalidated does not exhibit many incoming links and only a small set of outgoing links, so it is not a hub."
