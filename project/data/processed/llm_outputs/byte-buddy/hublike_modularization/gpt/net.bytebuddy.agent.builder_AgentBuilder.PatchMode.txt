    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.PatchMode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.PatchMode has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; these counts are low. Although the two referenced classes themselves have many internal dependencies, PatchMode's direct incoming/outgoing relationship set is small and does not meet the hub-like criterion."
