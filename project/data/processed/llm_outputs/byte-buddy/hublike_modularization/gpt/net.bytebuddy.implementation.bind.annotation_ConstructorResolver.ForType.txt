    "justification": "Not detected as Hub-like Modularization: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the two outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, the analysis of this class in isolation shows insufficient incoming and outgoing dependency counts to qualify as a hub."
