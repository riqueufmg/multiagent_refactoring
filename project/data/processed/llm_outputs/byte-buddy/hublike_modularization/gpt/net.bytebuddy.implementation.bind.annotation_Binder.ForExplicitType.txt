    "justification": "Not detected: incoming_dependencies is empty (no incoming relations) and the class has only three direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; while the referenced outgoing classes have many dependencies themselves, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large count of incoming or outgoing ties."
