    "justification": "DynamicType.Simple has only two direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, and only one incoming dependency: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType. While the referenced outgoing types list many of their own dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of distinct incoming and outgoing relationships required to classify it as a hub."
