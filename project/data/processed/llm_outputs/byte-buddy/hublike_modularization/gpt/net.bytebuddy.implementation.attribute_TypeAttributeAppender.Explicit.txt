    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []), and only two outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender. Although those two outgoing classes list many dependencies themselves, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing connections, so it is not a hub."
