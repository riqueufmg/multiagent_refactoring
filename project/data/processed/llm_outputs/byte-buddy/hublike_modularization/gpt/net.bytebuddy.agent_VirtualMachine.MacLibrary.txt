    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine). Although VirtualMachine lists many dependencies, net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.MacLibrary itself is only referenced by one abstraction and does not depend on many others, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
