    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although that target class has many dependencies, they are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class. Therefore the class is not a hub."
