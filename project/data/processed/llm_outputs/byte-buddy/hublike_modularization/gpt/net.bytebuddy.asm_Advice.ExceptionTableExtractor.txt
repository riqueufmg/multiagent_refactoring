    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ExceptionTableExtractor",

    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. (While the outgoing dependency references additional classes, those are not direct incoming/outgoing relationships of the analyzed class.)"
