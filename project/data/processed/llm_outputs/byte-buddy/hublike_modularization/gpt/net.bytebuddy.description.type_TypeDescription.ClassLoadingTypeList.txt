    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; this class lacks both a large number of incoming dependencies and a large number of distinct outgoing dependencies. (The outgoing target TypeList itself has many dependencies, but those are not direct incoming/outgoing ties of the analyzed class when considered in isolation.)"
