    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Given the provided data, TypeList.Explicit only directly depends on a single other abstraction and has no incoming links, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria. (Note: TypeDescription itself lists many dependencies, but per the isolation constraint only the analyzed class's direct incoming/outgoing dependencies are considered.)"
