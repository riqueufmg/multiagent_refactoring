    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Negation has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; Negation does not exhibit a large number of connections. (Note: one outgoing target, Implementation, has many dependencies, but that does not make Negation itself a hub when considered in isolation.)"
