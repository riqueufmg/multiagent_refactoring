    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the class to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 1 outgoing dependency (to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although that outgoing target (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself depends on many classes, the analyzed class does not have multiple direct incoming/outgoing links. Therefore it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
