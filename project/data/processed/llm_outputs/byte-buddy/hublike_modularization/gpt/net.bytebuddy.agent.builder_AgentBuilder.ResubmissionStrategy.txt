    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, and net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, and only 1 incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). The counts of incoming (1) and outgoing (3) are small and do not indicate a hub-like module."
