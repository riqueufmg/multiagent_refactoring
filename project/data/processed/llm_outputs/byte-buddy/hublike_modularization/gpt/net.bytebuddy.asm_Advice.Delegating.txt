Incoming dependencies: only 1 abstraction (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) references Advice.Delegating. Because the class has a modest number of outgoing links (7) and a single incoming link in the provided data, it does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies required to qualify as a hub-like modularization smell."
