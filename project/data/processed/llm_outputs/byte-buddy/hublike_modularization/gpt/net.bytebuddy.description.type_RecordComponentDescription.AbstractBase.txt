    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription. Because there are no incoming dependencies and the direct outgoing dependency set is small (3), this class does not meet the criteria for a hub-like modularization."
