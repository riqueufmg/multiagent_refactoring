    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.ClassLoading has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Although TypePool itself references many types (66 distinct dependencies listed), AgentBuilder.ClassLoading does not have both a large number of incoming and a large number of outgoing dependencies in the provided data, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
