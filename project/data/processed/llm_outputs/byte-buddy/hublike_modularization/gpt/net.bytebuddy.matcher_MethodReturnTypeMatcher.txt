    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. For MethodReturnTypeMatcher: incoming_dependencies = 0 (no classes depend on it). outgoing dependencies = 3: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher. The outgoing count (3) is small and there are no incoming dependencies, so it does not qualify as a hub."
