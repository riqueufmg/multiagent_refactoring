    "justification": "The class has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod references HashCodeMethod.NoOp). There is no evidence in the provided data of a large number of distinct incoming and outgoing connections required to qualify as hub-like modularization."
