    "justification": "InstrumentedType exhibits hub-like modularization: it has a large number of outgoing dependencies (e.g. TypeInitializer, JavaType, TypeDescription, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, TypeList, RecordComponentList, ModuleDescription, ByteCodeAppender, Factory, Default — 22 listed outgoing dependency targets) while also showing very high incoming usage from many core components across the system (DynamicType and its variants, DynamicType.Builder, DynamicType.AbstractBase, MethodRegistry and MethodRegistry.Handler, many dynamic builders such as SubclassDynamicTypeBuilder / Rebase/Inlining/Redefinition builders, AgentBuilder and AgentBuilder.Default/TypeStrategy, Advice, ByteBuddy, Implementation and many Implementation variants, MethodCall and its Factory/ArgumentLoader/TargetHandler, MethodDelegation and delegates, EqualsMethod, HashCodeMethod, ToStringMethod, StubMethod, InvokeDynamic, ExceptionMethod, etc.). The combination of broad fan-out (numerous classes it depends on) and broad fan-in (numerous important clients depending on it) identifies InstrumentedType as a hub-like abstraction."
