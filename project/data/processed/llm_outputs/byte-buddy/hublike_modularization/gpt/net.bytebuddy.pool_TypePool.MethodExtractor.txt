    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue) and zero incoming dependencies. Although those two outgoing targets list many of their own dependencies, the class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming and outgoing connections, so the hub-like smell is not present."
