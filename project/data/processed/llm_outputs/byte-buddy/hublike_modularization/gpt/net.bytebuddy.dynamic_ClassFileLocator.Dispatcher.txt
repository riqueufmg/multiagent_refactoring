    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of outgoing dependencies (3): net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, and net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin. It has a single incoming dependency entry from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows low in-degree (1) and low out-degree (3), so this class is not a hub."
