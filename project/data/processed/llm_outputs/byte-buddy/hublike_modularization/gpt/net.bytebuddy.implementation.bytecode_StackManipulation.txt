    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StackManipulation has a very large number of incoming dependencies from many other abstractions (examples: net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice and many of its nested types, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, numerous net.bytebuddy.implementation.* classes such as MethodCall, InvokeDynamic, EqualsMethod, HashCodeMethod, etc.), indicating it is widely depended upon. However, its outgoing dependency set is small — only the listed dependencies: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation.Size, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation.Dispatcher (5 entries). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and a large number of outgoing dependencies. Because StackManipulation exhibits many incoming but only a small number of outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module in the provided data."
