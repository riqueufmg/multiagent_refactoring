    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []), and only three outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; neither condition is met here."
