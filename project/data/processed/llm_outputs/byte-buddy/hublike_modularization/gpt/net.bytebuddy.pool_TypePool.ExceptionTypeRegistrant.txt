    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ExceptionTypeRegistrant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependency relationships. While the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing dependencies of TypePool.ExceptionTypeRegistrant, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
