    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = 0) and only three outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has neither high in-degree nor a large out-degree, so it is not a hub."
