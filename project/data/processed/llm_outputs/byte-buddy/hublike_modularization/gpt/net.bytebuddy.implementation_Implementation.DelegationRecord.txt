    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = 0) and only five outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). The smell requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not meet that criterion."
