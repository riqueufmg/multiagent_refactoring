    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 outgoing direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender). Although TypeDescription itself lists many related types, the analyzed class's outgoing degree is low and its incoming degree is zero; therefore it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
