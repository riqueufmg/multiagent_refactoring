    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: only 2 direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy). Although those two referenced classes themselves list many dependencies, the analyzed class itself has few direct incoming/outgoing links and therefore does not act as a hub connecting a large number of abstractions."
