    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.RawAnnotatedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "RawAnnotatedType has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like Modularization is characterized by an abstraction having many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The provided data shows few direct incoming/outgoing relations, so this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell. (While TypeList and TypeDescription themselves reference many types, those are not listed as direct dependencies of RawAnnotatedType in the input.)"
