    "justification": "Direct outgoing dependencies: 5 (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue). Direct incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.MethodCallProxy). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing links. Although some of the outgoing target types themselves have many internal dependencies, the analyzed class has a small set of direct outgoing dependencies (5) and only a single incoming dependent, so it does not meet the criterion for a hub."
