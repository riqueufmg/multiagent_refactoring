    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.StalenessFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StalenessFilter has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; these counts are low, so the smell is not detected. (Note: while net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin itself references many abstractions, StalenessFilter's direct dependency degree remains small.)"
