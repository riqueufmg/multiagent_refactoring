    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveWideningDelegate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PrimitiveWideningDelegate has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5): net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. It has a single incoming dependency recorded (1): net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveTypeAwareAssigner. By the provided definition, a hub-like module would show dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class exhibits only modest outbound coupling and minimal inbound coupling based on the supplied data, so it does not qualify as hub-like."
