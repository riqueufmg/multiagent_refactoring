    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 9 distinct abstractions (Assigner; AnnotationDescription; MethodDescription; ParameterDescription; FieldLocator; JavaType; HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin; TypeDescription). Incoming dependencies: only 1 abstraction (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing links; while Advice.Unresolved has multiple outgoing dependencies, it has a single incoming dependency in the provided data, so it does not meet the 'hub-like' criterion."
