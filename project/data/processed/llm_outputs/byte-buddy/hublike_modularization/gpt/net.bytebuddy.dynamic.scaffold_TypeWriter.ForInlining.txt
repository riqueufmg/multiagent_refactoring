    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has many outgoing dependencies (23 total), e.g. net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader, net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper. However, it has only one incoming dependency in the provided data: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here outgoing are many but incoming relationships are not (only the enclosing TypeWriter), so the smell is not detected based on the provided, in-isolation data."
