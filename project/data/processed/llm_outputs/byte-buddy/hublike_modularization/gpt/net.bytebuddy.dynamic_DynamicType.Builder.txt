    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (many distinct abstractions are referenced, e.g. net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, etc.), but the incoming dependency set contains only a single abstraction (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType) referencing this builder. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here the outgoing side is large while the incoming side is not, so the smell is not detected."
