    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder) and one outgoing dependency (to net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). It does not exhibit dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
