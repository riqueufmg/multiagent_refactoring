    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 1 outgoing dependency (depends on net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although that outgoing class has many of its own dependencies, the subject class itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
