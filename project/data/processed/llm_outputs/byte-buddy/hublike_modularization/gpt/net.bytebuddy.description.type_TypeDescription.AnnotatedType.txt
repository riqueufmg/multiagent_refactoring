    "justification": "Incoming dependencies are numerous (57 distinct references including TypeDescription.WithEagerNavigation, TypeDefinition, MethodDescription, FieldList, ClassFileVersion, AnnotationList, JavaDispatcher, etc.), but outgoing dependencies are minimal (only one direct outgoing: net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming side is large while the outgoing side is not, so the smell is not detected."
