    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForMissingValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies (high fan-in and fan-out). Although the outgoing target classes list many dependencies themselves, the analyzed class itself does not show a large number of incoming or outgoing connections, so the smell is not detected."
