    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.UnresolvedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; these counts do not meet that criterion."
