    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor.ContextClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ContextClassVisitor has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; these counts are small, so the smell is not present."
