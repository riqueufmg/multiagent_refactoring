    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 4 direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList. Because there are no incoming dependencies and only a small number (4) of direct outgoing dependencies, this class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
