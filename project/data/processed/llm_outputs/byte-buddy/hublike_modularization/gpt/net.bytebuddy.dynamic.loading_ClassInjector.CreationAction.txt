    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ClassInjector.CreationAction has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy) and one recorded incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). While the related ClassLoadingStrategy and ClassInjector abstractions list many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing ties of CreationAction per the provided data. Therefore CreationAction does not exhibit hub-like modularization (it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions)."
