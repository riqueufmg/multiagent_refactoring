    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited to 3 distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Incoming dependencies include only a single class (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Because the class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships (incoming = 1, outgoing = 3), it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
