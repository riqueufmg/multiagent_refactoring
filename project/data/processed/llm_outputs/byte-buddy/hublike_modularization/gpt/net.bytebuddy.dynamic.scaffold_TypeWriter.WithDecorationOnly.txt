    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. This class has many outgoing dependencies (16 distinct outgoing types including net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, etc.) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). The absence of incoming links prevents it from being a hub as defined."
