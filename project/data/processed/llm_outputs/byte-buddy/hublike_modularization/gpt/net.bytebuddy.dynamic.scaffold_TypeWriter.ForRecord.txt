    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 0 (no outgoing_dependencies). Incoming dependencies: 1 (only net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter references this class). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has neither a large incoming fan-in (only one incoming) nor any outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
