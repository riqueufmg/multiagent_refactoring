    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not exhibit that pattern."
