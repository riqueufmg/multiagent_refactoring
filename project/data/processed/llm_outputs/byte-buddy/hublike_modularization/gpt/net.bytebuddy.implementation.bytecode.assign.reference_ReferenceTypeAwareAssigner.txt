    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ReferenceTypeAwareAssigner has only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.TypeCasting) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner). These low counts of direct incoming and outgoing relationships do not constitute a hub-like module. Note: while TypeDescription (one outgoing) itself relates to many types, those are not direct dependencies of ReferenceTypeAwareAssigner and therefore do not make it a hub in isolation."
