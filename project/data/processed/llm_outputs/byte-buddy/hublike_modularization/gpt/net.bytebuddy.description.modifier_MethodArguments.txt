    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor) and zero incoming dependencies according to the provided data (outgoing_dependencies lists ModifierContributor; incoming_dependencies is empty). Therefore it is not a hub."
