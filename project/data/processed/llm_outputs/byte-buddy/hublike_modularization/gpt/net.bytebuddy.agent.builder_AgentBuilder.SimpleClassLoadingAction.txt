    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although that outgoing dependency itself references many types, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of the analyzed class in isolation, so the class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
