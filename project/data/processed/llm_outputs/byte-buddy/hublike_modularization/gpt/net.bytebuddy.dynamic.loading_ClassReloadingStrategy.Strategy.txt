    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy.Strategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy). Outgoing count = 1 (TypeDescription). Incoming count = 1 (ClassReloadingStrategy). Although TypeDescription (an outgoing dependency) itself has many dependencies, those are not dependencies of Strategy. Therefore Strategy does not exhibit hub-like modularization (it does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
