    "justification": "No incoming dependencies are reported for this class (incoming_dependencies: []). It has four direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here incoming coupling is zero and outgoing coupling is modest (4), so the hub-like smell is not present."
