    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithDrain",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter) and only three outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows neither a large incoming set nor a large outgoing set, so this class is not a hub."
