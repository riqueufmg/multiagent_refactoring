    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.DefaultValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DefaultValue has 8 outgoing dependencies (DoubleConstant, IntegerConstant, TypeDefinition, LongConstant, FloatConstant, StackManipulation, Implementation, NullConstant) and 3 incoming dependencies (StubMethod, VoidAwareAssigner, Binder). These dependencies are concentrated on closely related constant classes and core bytecode/implementation types (StackManipulation, Implementation, TypeDefinition) rather than a large, diverse set of unrelated abstractions. The incoming dependency set is small (3 callers) and the outgoing set is focused, indicating a cohesive role rather than a hub-like connector; therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
