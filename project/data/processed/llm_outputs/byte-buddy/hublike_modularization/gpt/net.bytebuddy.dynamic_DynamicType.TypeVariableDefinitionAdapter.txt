    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.TypeVariableDefinitionAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only two direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeVariableToken) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 2, so the smell is not present."
