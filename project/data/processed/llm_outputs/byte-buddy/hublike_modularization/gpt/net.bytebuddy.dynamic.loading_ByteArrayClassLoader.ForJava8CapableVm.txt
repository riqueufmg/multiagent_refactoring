    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. (Note: the outgoing dependency itself lists many dependencies, but that does not create many direct incoming/outgoing links for the analyzed class.)"
