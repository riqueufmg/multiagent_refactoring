    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). That yields a small set of direct incoming/outgoing relations (4 unique other abstractions). Because Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, the provided data does not indicate a hub-like structure for net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForMethod."
