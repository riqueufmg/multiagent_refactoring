    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization is not detected because AgentBuilder.NoOp has a small number of direct relationships: 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) and 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Although the outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, AgentBuilder.NoOp's own incoming/outgoing degree is low (2 outgoing, 1 incoming), so it does not act as a hub."
