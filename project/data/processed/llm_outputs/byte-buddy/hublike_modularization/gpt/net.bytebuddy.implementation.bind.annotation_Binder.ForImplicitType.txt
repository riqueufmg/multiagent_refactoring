    "justification": "Hub-like modularization not detected: the analyzed class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) and only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder). Both incoming and outgoing connection counts are low (incoming = 1, outgoing = 1). Although the outgoing target (Implementation) itself references many types, that does not increase the analyzed class's direct incoming/outgoing dependency counts; therefore it is not a hub."
