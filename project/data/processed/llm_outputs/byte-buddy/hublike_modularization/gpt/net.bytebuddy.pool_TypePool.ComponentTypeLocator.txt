    "justification": "The class has a small number of incoming and outgoing dependencies: incoming references = 1 (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and outgoing dependencies = 2 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Because it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (only these two outgoing and one incoming), it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
