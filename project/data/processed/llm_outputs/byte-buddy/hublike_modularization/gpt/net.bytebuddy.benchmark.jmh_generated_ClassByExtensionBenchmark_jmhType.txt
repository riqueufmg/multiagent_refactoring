    "justification": "The class has many incoming dependencies (16 distinct classes in net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated reference it, e.g. multiple ClassByExtensionBenchmark_*_jmhTest classes) but has zero outgoing dependencies (no dependencies listed). Hub-like Modularization requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; since outgoing_dependencies = 0, this class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
