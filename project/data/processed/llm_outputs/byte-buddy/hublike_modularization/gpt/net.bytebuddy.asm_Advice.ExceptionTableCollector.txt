    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ExceptionTableCollector",

    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows minimal connections (Outgoing count = 1, Incoming count = 0), so the smell is not present."
