    "justification": "Not detected: CollectionSizeMatcher has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit that pattern. (While the outgoing targets list many of their own dependencies, CollectionSizeMatcher itself does not have many incoming/outgoing relations.)"
