    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodRebaseResolver, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not meet that criterion."
