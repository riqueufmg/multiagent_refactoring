    "justification": "Not detected: the class has outgoing dependencies to three abstractions (net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and the number of outgoing dependencies is small, so it does not qualify."
