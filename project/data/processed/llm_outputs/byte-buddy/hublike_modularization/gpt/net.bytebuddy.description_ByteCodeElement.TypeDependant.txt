    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement.TypeDependant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only one outgoing dependency (depends on net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies; those conditions are not met here. Note: ByteCodeElement has several dependencies, but those are outgoing from ByteCodeElement, not incoming to ByteCodeElement.TypeDependant, and thus do not make TypeDependant a hub."
