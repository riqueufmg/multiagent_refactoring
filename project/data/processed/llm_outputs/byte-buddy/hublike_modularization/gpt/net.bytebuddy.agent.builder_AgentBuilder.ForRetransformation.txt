    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; the provided data shows only a single direct outgoing link and no incoming links. Note: although the referenced AgentBuilder lists many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of ForRetransformation in the provided data."
