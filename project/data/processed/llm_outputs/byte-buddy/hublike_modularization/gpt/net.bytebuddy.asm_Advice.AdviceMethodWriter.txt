    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AdviceMethodWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Advice.AdviceMethodWriter has 5 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and only 1 documented incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Although several of those outgoing targets themselves reference many other abstractions, the analyzed class itself does not show a large number of distinct incoming and outgoing direct dependencies. Therefore it does not meet the criterion for Hub-like Modularization."
