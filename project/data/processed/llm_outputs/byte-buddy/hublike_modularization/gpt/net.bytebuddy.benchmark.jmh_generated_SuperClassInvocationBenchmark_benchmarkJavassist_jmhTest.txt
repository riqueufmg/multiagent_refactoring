    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_jmhType) and 0 incoming dependencies, so it does not exhibit high bidirectional connectivity and therefore is not a hub."
