    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. For this class: incoming_dependencies = [] (no incoming dependencies). Outgoing dependencies include 7 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.enumeration.EnumerationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue. Because there are outgoing links but zero incoming links, the class does not meet the definition (both incoming and outgoing) and therefore is not detected as a hub-like modularization."
