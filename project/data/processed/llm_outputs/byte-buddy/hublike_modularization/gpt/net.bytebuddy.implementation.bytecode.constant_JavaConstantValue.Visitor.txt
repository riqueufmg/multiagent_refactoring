    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant) and only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.JavaConstantValue) in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and many outgoing). Although net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class and, per the constraint to consider the class in isolation, do not make the analyzed class a hub."
