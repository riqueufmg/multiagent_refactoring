    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Value",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MemberSubstitution.Value has only 2 direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Although the referenced TypeDescription and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin entries list many of their own dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships. Therefore it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization criterion."
