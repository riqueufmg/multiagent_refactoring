    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement) but has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both widespread incoming and outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions; this class lacks incoming relationships and only directly depends on a small set of other abstractions. Although one outgoing dependency (TypeDescription) itself references many types, the smell is evaluated for the analyzed class in isolation, so it does not qualify as a hub."
