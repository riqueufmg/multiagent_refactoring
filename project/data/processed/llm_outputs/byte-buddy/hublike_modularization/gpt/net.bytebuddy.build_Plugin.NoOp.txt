    "justification": "Plugin.NoOp has a small number of relationships: incoming dependencies from 1 abstraction (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin) and outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). The total set of distinct other abstractions involved is 3, which does not indicate a hub-like module with many incoming and outgoing dependencies."
