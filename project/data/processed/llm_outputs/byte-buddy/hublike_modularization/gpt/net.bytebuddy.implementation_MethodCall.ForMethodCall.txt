Outgoing dependencies: 6 (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). The class has a small, focused set of both incoming and outgoing relationships rather than dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
