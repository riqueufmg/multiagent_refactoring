    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ReadOnly",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Advice.ReadOnly has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. The provided data shows few direct outgoing links and no incoming links, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria. (Note: TypeDescription itself depends on many types, but those are transitive and do not make Advice.ReadOnly have many direct incoming/outgoing dependencies.)"
