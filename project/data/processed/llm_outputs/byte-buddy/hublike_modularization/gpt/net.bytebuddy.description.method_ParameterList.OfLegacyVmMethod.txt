    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have substantial numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; those conditions are not met. (Although the two outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit the required high incoming/outgoing coupling.)"
