    "justification": "Incoming dependency count = 1 (only net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution references ForFieldAccess). Outgoing dependency count = 6 (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming links are minimal and outgoing links are moderate, so the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
