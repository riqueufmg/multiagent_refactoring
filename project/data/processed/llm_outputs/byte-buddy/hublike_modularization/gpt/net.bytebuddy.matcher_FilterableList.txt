    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FilterableList has a large number of incoming dependencies (24 distinct classes depend on it, e.g. net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList.Empty) but only a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many dependencies in both directions; here the incoming fan-in is high while the outgoing fan-out is minimal (1), therefore FilterableList does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
