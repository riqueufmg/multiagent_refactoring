    "justification": "No incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; with both incoming and outgoing dependency counts at zero, this class does not exhibit the smell."
