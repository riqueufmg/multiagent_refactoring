    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, and it has 0 incoming dependencies. Because it does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies (incoming = 0, outgoing = 3), it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
