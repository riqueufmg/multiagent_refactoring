    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.SubTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SubTypeMatcher has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. Although the cited outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, SubTypeMatcher in isolation does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
