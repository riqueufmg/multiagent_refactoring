    "justification": "ModifierMatcher has a small number of direct incoming and outgoing couplings: outgoing dependencies = {net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ModifierMatcher.Mode, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher} (3); incoming dependencies = {net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ModifierMatcher.Mode} (2). These counts are low and do not indicate an abstraction acting as a hub. (Although some referenced collaborators like ElementMatchers and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin themselves list many dependencies, those are indirect and do not increase ModifierMatcher's direct incoming/outgoing dependency footprint.)"
