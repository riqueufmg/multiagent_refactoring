    "justification": "Ownership is referenced by a large number of other abstractions (14 incoming dependents in the provided data, e.g. net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable). However, it has only a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many dependencies in both directions (high incoming and high outgoing). Because Ownership's outgoing degree is minimal, the smell is not detected."
