    "justification": "The class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (≈55 distinct types listed, e.g. MethodCall.TargetHandler, MethodCall.Factory, Implementation, MethodDescription, TypeDescription/TypeDefinition, FieldDescription, MethodGraph, FieldLocator, Assigner, StackManipulation, ByteCodeAppender, JavaConstant, ConstantValue, many MethodCall.For* inner variants) while also having multiple incoming dependents (at least 6 distinct callers/clients shown, e.g. net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory and its CreateClassVisitorFactory, MethodCall.Factory, MethodCall.ArgumentLoader, MethodCall.ForMethodCall, MethodCall.TargetHandler, MethodCall.FieldSetting). The combination of a large outgoing fan‑out and several incoming dependents indicates a hub-like role, i.e., Hub-like Modularization."
