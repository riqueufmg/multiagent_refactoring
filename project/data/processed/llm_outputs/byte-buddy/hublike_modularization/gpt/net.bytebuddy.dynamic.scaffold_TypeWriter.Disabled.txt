    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: none (empty list). Incoming dependencies: a single incoming dependent (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. This class has zero outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependent, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell. Note: the long dependency list shown under the incoming dependent belongs to TypeWriter itself, not to TypeWriter.Disabled."
