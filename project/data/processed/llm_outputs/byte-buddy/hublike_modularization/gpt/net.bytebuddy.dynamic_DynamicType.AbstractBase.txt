    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are numerous (≈43 distinct types, e.g. net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter). However incoming dependencies are minimal: only one incoming component is listed (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). Although there is a mutual link with net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType (appears in both outgoing and incoming lists), the class does not have a large number of incoming dependencies. Because the smell requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies, this class does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
