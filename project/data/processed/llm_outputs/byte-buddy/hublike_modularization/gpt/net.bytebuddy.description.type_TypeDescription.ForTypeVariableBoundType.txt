    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForTypeVariableBoundType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and only 1 incoming dependency source (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; these direct counts are small. (Note: the listed targets themselves depend on many types, but that does not increase the analyzed class's direct incoming/outgoing dependency counts.)"
