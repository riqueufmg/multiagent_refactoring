    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 12 distinct abstractions (Assigner, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, ParameterDescription, FieldLocator, MethodCall, InstrumentedType, FieldDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation, TypeDescription, Duplication). Incoming dependencies: only 1 abstraction (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although TargetHandler has many outgoing dependencies, it has a single incoming dependency, so it does not meet the criterion for a hub-like module."
