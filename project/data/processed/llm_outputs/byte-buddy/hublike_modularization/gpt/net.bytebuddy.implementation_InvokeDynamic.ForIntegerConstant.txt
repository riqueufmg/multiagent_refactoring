    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Because it lacks incoming links and has a small number of direct outgoing links, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
