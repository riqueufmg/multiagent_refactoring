    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.DefaultValue) and 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). These counts are low and do not indicate a hub-like concentration of many incoming and outgoing relationships, so the smell is not detected."
