    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency (one class: net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Here there are zero outgoing links and only one incoming link, so the hub-like smell is not present."
