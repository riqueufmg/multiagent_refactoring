    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.BuildLogger",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BuildLogger has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and only 2 incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidService and net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.LegacyByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows small incoming and outgoing counts, so the smell is not present."
