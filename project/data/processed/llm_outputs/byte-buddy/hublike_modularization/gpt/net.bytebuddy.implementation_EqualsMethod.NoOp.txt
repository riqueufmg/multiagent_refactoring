    "detection": false,
    "justification": "EqualsMethod.NoOp has a small number of relations: 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod). Although EqualsMethod itself depends on many abstractions, EqualsMethod.NoOp is not connected to a large number of other abstractions in both directions, so it does not meet the hub-like modularization symptom."
