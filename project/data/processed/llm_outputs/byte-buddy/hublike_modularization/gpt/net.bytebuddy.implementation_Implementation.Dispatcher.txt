    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies for the class are empty (outgoing_dependencies = []). There is only a single incoming dependency entry (incoming_dependencies length = 1) from net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the incoming class lists many dependencies, those are dependencies of the incoming class, not direct multiple incoming/outgoing ties to Implementation.Dispatcher. Considering the class in isolation, it does not exhibit the required large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
