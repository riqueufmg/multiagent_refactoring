    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class lacks incoming dependencies and its outgoing dependency count is small, so it does not exhibit the hub-like smell."
