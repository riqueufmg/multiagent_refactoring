    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has only one direct incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy) and one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). While JavaDispatcher lists many internal dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of ClassReloadingStrategy.Dispatcher itself. With only one incoming and one outgoing abstraction, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
