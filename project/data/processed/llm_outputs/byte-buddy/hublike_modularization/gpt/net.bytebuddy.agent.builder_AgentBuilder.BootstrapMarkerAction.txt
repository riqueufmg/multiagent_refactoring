    "justification": "The class has a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder) and a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; here there is only one direct incoming and one direct outgoing dependency. Note: although AgentBuilder and ClassLoadingStrategy themselves reference many other types in the provided data, those are not direct additional incoming/outgoing edges for BootstrapMarkerAction in the given inputs."
