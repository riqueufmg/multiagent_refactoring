    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and 2 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Because incoming = 0 and outgoing = 2 (a small number), it does not meet the criteria for a hub. Note: the outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, but per the analysis constraint the class is considered in isolation, so those do not make this class a hub."
