    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RenamingPlugin.RenamingRemapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. With incoming=0 and outgoing=1, this class does not meet the criteria. Note: OpenedClassReader has its own dependencies, but those are indirect and do not make RenamingRemapper a hub when analyzed in isolation."
