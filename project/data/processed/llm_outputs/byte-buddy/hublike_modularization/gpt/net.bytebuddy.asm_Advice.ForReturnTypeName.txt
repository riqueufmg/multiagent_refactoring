Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming AND outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions. Here the class has zero outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria. (Note: net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice itself references many types, but that reflects the caller's dependencies, not many distinct incoming/outgoing ties for Advice.ForReturnTypeName.)"
