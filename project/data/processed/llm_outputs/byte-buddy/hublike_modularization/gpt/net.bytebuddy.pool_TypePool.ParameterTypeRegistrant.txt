    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No. The class has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only one direct outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections; despite the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin listing many of its own dependencies, TypePool.ParameterTypeRegistrant itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies."
