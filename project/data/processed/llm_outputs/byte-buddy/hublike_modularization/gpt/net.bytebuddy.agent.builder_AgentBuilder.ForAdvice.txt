    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has many outgoing dependencies (9 direct: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and those outgoing targets reference many other abstractions, but there are no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []). Because there are no incoming dependencies, the class does not meet the requirement of having both large incoming and outgoing coupling and therefore is not detected as Hub-like Modularization."
