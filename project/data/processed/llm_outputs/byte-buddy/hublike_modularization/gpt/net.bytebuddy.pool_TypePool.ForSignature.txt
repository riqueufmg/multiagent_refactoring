    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForSignature",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one recorded outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and a single recorded incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections to many other abstractions; the provided data shows only one incoming and one outgoing relationship, so the smell is not present. (Although HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself depends on many types, that does not increase the analyzed class's direct incoming/outgoing dependency counts.)"
