    "justification": "The class has only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). Given the low number of distinct incoming and outgoing relationships in the provided data, it does not meet the definition of Hub-like Modularization (an abstraction with dependencies to a large number of other abstractions)."
