    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: only two direct dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Although those two targets themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class has no incoming links and only two outgoing links, so it does not exhibit the required pattern of having both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
