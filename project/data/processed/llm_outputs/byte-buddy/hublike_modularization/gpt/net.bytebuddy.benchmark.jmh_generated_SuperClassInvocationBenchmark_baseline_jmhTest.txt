    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_jmhType, and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided counts (outgoing=1, incoming=0) do not meet that criterion."
