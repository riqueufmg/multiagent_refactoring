    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SyntheticState has a low degree of outgoing coupling (1 outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor) and a modest number of incoming dependents (4 incoming classes: net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType, net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable, net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase). Although some incoming classes reference many other abstractions, SyntheticState itself does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections required to qualify as hub-like modularization."
