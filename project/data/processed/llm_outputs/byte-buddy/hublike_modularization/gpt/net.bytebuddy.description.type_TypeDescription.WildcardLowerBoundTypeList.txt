    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.WildcardLowerBoundTypeList",

    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Here outgoing_count=1 and incoming_count=0, so it does not meet the 'large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies' criterion. (Note: the outgoing target TypeList has many dependencies, but the analysis is limited to the class in isolation.)"
