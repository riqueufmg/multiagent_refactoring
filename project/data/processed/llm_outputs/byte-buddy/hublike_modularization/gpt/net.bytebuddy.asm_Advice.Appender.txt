    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. However, incoming_dependencies is empty (0). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although some of the outgoing targets (notably net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice and AsmVisitorWrapper) themselves depend on many other types, Advice.Appender has no incoming links in the provided data, so it does not meet the hub-like condition."
