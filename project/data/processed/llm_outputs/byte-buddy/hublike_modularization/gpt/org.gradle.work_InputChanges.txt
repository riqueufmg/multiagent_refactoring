    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTask) and one outgoing dependency (org.gradle.api.provider.Provider). This is a small number of connections and does not meet the 'large number of other abstractions' criterion for Hub-like Modularization when analyzed in isolation."
