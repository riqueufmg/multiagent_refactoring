    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Transformation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Transformation has 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin, net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.PluginArgument, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) and 2 incoming dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTaskExtension, net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTask). These are small numbers of direct incoming and outgoing ties and do not constitute a hub. While some referenced targets (e.g., Plugin, ClassFileLocator) themselves reference many types, the analysis is constrained to the Transformation class in isolation and shows no large number of direct dependencies in both directions."
