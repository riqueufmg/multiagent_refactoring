    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.TypeExtractor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has outgoing dependencies on 6 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue. It has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies (high in-degree and out-degree). Because this class has no incoming dependencies (in-degree = 0), it does not meet the hub-like pattern despite having multiple outgoing links."
