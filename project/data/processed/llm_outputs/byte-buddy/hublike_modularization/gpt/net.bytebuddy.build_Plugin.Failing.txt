    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here Plugin.Failing is referenced by a single class and does not depend on other abstractions, so it is not a hub."
