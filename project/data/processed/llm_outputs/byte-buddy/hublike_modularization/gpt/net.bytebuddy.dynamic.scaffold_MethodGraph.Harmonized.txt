    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. In the provided data this class has a single outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, and a single incoming dependent class entry: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph. There is no evidence of many distinct incoming or outgoing abstraction relationships for MethodGraph.Harmonized in the input (outgoing count = 1, incoming count = 1), so it does not meet the hub-like modularization smell criteria."
