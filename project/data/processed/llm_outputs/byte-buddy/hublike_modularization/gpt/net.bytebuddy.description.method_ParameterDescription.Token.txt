    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ParameterDescription.Token has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (4): net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin. It has a single incoming depender (1): net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here both incoming (1) and outgoing (4) counts are low. Although some of its outgoing dependencies themselves depend on many types, those are transitive and do not make Token directly hub-like. Therefore the smell is not detected."
