    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, and only one incoming dependency recorded: net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows low numbers of incoming and outgoing links. (Note: Implementation itself lists many dependencies, but those are dependencies of Implementation, not of the analyzed class.)"
