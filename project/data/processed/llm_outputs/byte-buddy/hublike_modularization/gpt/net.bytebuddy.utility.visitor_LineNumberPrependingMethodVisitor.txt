    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low coupling in the provided data: only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; the observed fan-in and fan-out are minimal, so the smell is not detected."
