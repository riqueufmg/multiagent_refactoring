    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the single outgoing target (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself depends on many types (16 dependencies listed), the analyzed class does not exhibit the required high number of incoming and outgoing relationships in isolation."
