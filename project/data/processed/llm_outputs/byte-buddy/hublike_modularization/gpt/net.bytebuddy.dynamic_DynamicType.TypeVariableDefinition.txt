    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.TypeVariableDefinition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList) and a single incoming dependency entry (referenced by net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here both counts are low. Although the outgoing targets (TypeList, AnnotationList) themselves reference multiple other types, the analysis must consider the class in isolation, so those transitive connections do not make DynamicType.TypeVariableDefinition a hub."
