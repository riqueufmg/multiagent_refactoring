    "justification": "Not detected: Advice.WriterFactory has a limited outgoing dependency set (5 types: net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and only a single incoming dependency listed (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the incoming side here is limited to one client, so it does not qualify as hub-like."
