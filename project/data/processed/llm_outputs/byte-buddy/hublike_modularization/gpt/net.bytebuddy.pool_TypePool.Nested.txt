    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and a small set of direct outgoing dependencies (4 direct dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing are limited, so the smell is not detected."
