    "justification": "SerializedConstant has 8 outgoing dependencies (Duplication, TypeCreation, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation, TypeDescription, NullConstant) but zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; because the in-degree is 0, this class is not a hub."
