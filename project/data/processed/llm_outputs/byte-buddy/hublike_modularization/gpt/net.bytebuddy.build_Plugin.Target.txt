    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Target has a small set of relationships when considered in isolation — 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low incoming/outgoing counts, so the smell is not present."
