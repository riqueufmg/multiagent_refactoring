    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. For net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForConstant the provided data shows zero incoming dependencies (\"incoming_dependencies\": []). While it has outgoing dependencies to four other abstractions (MethodDescription, TypeDescription, CachedReturnPlugin, AnnotationValue) — and those targets themselves have many dependencies — the analyzed class lacks incoming coupling. Because it does not have a large number of incoming dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
