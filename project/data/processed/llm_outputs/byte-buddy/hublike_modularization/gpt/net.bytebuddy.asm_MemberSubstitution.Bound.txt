    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Bound",

    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has outgoing dependencies to 8 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. However, there are 0 incoming dependencies reported. Because the class lacks incoming dependencies (incoming count = 0) despite multiple outgoing links (outgoing count = 8), it does not meet the definition of a hub (which requires many incoming and outgoing connections). Therefore detection = false."
