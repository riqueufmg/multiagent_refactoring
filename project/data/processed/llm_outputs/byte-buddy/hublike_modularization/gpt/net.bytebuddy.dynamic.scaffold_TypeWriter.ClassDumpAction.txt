    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization is not detected because the class has a small number of direct connections: outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter). The definition requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not exhibit a large incoming or outgoing fan-in/fan-out when considered in isolation."
