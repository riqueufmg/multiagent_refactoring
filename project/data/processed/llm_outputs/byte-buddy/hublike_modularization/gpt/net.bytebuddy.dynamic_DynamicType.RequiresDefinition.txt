    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. Although net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType lists many dependencies, those are not incoming/outgoing links for RequiresDefinition itself."
