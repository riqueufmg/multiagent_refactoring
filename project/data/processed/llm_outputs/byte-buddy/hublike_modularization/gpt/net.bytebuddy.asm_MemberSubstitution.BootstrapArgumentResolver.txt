    "justification": "Not detected: the class has a small set of outgoing dependencies (4: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant) and only a single incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections, which is not the case here."
