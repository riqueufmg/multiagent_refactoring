    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FileSystem.Files has a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing target (JavaDispatcher) itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links to FileSystem.Files in the provided data, so FileSystem.Files does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
