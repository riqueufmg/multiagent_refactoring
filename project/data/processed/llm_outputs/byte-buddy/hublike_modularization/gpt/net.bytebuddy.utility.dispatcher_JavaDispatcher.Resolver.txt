    "justification": "JavaDispatcher.Resolver has only one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing counts are low (1 each). Note: while HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself depends on many types, those are not direct dependencies of JavaDispatcher.Resolver under the provided, per-class data."
