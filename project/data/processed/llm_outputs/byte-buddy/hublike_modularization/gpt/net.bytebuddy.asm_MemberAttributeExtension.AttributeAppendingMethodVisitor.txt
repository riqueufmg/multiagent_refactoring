    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only four direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Per the constraint to consider the class in isolation, transitive dependencies of the outgoing targets are not counted."
