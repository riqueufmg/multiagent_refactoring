    "justification": "MemberSubstitution.Sort has only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Although the referenced dependencies themselves have many relations, the class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections required for Hub-like Modularization."
