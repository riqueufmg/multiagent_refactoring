    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.CodeTranslationVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although Advice.CodeTranslationVisitor has outgoing dependencies to multiple abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription), there are no incoming dependencies reported. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming dependency set is empty, so the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell based on the provided data."
