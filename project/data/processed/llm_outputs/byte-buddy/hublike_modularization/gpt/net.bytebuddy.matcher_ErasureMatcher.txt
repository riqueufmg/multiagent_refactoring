    "justification": "Not detected: incoming_dependencies is empty (no other abstractions depend on this class) and outgoing dependencies are limited to two abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here incoming count = 0 and outgoing count = 2, so the smell is not present."
