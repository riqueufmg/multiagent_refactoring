    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: although the class has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (10 distinct abstractions: Assigner; AnnotationDescription; MethodDescription; StackManipulation; ParameterDescription; JavaConstant; HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin; TypeList; TypeDescription; NullConstant), it has only a single incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). The smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here the incoming degree is low (1), so the class is not hub-like."
