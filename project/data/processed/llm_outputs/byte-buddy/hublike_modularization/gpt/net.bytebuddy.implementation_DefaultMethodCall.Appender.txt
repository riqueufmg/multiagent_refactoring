    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.DefaultMethodCall.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Although the outgoing targets themselves reference many types, the analyzed class in isolation shows low fan-out (3) and no fan-in (0), so it does not qualify as a hub."
