    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (no other abstractions depend on it) and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender). Although one outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself references many types, the analyzed class does not exhibit both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
