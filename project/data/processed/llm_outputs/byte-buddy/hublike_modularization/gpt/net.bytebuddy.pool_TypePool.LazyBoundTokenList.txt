    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 3 direct targets — net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections; this class has no incoming connections and only three outgoing dependencies, so it does not qualify as a hub. (Note: some outbound targets themselves list many dependencies, but the smell is evaluated on the class's own incoming/outgoing degree.)"
