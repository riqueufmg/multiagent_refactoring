    "justification": "JavaType has a small set of direct outgoing dependencies (6: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType.LatentTypeWithSimpleName) while being referenced by a very large number of other abstractions. The provided incoming_dependencies list includes ~72 distinct classes/modules (examples: net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice and many of its nested types, net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution and its nested types, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder and multiple AgentBuilder components, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector and ClassInjector.UsingLookup, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator and its variants, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool and variants, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy and related strategies, net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic and related providers, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation, among many others). The high incoming fan-in combined with the outgoing links makes JavaType act as a central hub connecting a large portion of the system, which matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
