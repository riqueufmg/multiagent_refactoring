    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Narrowable has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows no outgoing edges and a single incoming edge, so the hub-like smell is not present. (Note: AgentBuilder itself lists many dependencies, but those are dependencies of AgentBuilder, not of AgentBuilder.Narrowable.)"
