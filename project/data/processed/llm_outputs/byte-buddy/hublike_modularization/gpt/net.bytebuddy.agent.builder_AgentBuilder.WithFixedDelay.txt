    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and outgoing links). Here the class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies. Note: although the single outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself depends on many types, the analysis is performed in isolation for this class, so those transitive connections do not make this class a hub."
