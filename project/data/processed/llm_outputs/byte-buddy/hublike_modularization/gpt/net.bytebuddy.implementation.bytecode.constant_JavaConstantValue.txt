Incoming dependencies (1): net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.Invokedynamic. Hub-like Modularization is characterized by an abstraction having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; here the class has only five outgoing and a single incoming dependency, which is not a large bidirectional coupling and therefore does not qualify as hub-like."
