    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.MethodInvoker",

    "justification": "MethodDelegationBinder.MethodInvoker has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder) and 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). These are small counts of incoming/outgoing relationships and do not represent dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. (While the two outgoing targets list many transitive dependencies, the analyzed class itself directly depends on only two abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization.)"
