    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
