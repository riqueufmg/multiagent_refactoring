    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and outgoing). Given the low counts (1 outgoing, 0 incoming), the smell is not present."
