{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.MethodTokenList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (no other abstractions depend on it) and only 2 explicit outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList and net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows low counts for both. (Per the constraint, analysis considers the class in isolation and does not assume additional transitive dependencies.)"
