    "justification": "Not detected: the analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here both counts are low. Note: while the referenced classes list many dependencies themselves, the analysis is limited to the analyzed class in isolation and its direct incoming/outgoing couplings."
