    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []) and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin). Although the referenced Plugin node lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of the analyzed class. With 0 incoming and a single direct outgoing dependency, this class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
