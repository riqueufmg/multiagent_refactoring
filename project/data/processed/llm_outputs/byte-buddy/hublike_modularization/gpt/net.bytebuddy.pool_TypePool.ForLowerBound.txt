    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 0 outgoing dependencies (incoming_dependencies: [], outgoing_dependencies: []). The analyzed_package.dependencies list is also empty. Because Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, this class does not meet that criterion."
