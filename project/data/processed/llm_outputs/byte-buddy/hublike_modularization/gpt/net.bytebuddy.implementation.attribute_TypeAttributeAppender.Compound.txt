    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.TypeAttributeAppender.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only a single outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class exhibits low connectivity. Note: although HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin has many dependencies, those are indirect and do not make the analyzed class a hub when considered in isolation."
