    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Inversion has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself depends on many types, AgentBuilder.Inversion's direct dependency set is small (one) and it has no incoming links, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
