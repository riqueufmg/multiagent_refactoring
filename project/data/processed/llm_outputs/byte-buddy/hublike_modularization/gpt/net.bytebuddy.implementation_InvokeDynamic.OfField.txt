    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not meet that criterion."
