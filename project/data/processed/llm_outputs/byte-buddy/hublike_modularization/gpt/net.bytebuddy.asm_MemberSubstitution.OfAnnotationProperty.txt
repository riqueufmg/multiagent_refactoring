    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 5 classes — net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because this class has zero incoming dependencies and only five outgoing dependencies, it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
