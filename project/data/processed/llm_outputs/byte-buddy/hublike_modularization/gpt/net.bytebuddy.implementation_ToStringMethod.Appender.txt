    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.ToStringMethod.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of direct relationships: 6 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodReturn, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.ToStringMethod). Under the Hub-like Modularization definition an abstraction must have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both incoming and outgoing directions. Given the low incoming count and a modest number of outgoing links, this class does not meet the criterion for a hub-like module. (Per constraints, analysis considers the class in isolation and does not treat the extensive internal dependencies of referenced types as links of this class.)"
