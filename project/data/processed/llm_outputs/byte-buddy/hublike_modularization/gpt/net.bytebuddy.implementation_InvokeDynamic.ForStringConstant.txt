Outgoing dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only three outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell. Note: although one outgoing dependency (TypeDescription) itself has many dependencies, those are not incoming to the analyzed class and therefore do not make this class a hub."
