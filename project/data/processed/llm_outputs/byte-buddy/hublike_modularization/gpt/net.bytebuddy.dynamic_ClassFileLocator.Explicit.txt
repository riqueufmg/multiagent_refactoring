    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only two direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections. Although the two referenced classes list many of their own dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
