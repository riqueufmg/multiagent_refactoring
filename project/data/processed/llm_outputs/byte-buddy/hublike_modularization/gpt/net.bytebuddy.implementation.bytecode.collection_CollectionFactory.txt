    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.CollectionFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CollectionFactory has only two outgoing direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and zero incoming dependencies. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions. Although one of its outgoing targets (TypeDescription) references many classes, CollectionFactory itself does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies based on the provided data, so it is not a hub."
