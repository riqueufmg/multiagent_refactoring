    "justification": "AgentBuilder.ForPatchWithGap has 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class shows low outgoing coupling (2) and no incoming coupling, so it is not a hub. Note: the many dependencies listed under the two outgoing classes are indirect (dependencies of those classes), not direct incoming/outgoing relationships of AgentBuilder.ForPatchWithGap."
