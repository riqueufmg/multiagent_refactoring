    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies per the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion. Note: although the two referenced classes have many internal dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class in the supplied data."
