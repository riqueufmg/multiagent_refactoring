    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. For this class: incoming_dependencies is empty (no incoming dependents). Outgoing dependencies exist but only to three abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator. Because there are zero incoming dependencies, the class does not meet the 'hub' criterion and therefore is not detected as Hub-like Modularization."
