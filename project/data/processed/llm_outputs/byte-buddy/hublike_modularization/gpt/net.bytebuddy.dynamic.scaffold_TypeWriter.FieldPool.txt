    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.FieldPool",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter) and 4 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter). Neither the incoming nor outgoing sets constitute a large number of connections required to consider it a hub-like module. While some referenced classes themselves have many dependencies, the analysis of this class in isolation shows limited direct incoming and outgoing links, so it is not a hub."
