    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter) and 6 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Although some of those outgoing types themselves reference many other types, the analysis must consider the class in isolation. Given the limited number of direct incoming and outgoing connections, this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
