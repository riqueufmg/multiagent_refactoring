    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has multiple outgoing dependencies (7 direct dependencies: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.enumeration.EnumerationDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription), and those targets further reference many other abstractions. However, there are no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; because this class lacks incoming dependencies, it does not qualify as a hub."
