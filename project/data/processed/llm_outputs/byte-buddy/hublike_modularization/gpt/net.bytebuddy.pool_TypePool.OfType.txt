    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: only one direct dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only a single outgoing dependency, so the smell is not present. Note: the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin has many dependencies, but considering the class in isolation, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links for TypePool.OfType."
