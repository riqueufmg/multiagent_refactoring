    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 6 direct outgoing dependencies [net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodAccessorFactory, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription] and zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming coupling is absent and direct outgoing coupling is limited. (Although those outgoing targets have many transitive dependencies, the smell is judged on the class's direct incoming/outgoing relationships.)"
