Outgoing dependencies: 3 direct dependencies — net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 3 (small). Although the referenced outgoing classes list many transitive dependencies, the analysis of this class in isolation shows it is not a hub."
