    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 0 (none). Incoming dependencies: 1 (only from net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has no outgoing dependencies and only a single incoming reference, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
