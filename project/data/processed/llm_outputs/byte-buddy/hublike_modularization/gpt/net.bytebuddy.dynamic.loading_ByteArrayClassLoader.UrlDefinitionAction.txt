    "justification": "Not detected: the class has outgoing dependencies to three abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships (outgoing count = 3, incoming count = 0), so it is not a hub."
