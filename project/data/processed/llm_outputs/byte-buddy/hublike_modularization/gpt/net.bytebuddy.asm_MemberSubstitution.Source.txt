Incoming dependencies (1): net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution. The class has a small number of distinct incoming and outgoing relationships (5 outgoing, 1 incoming) and therefore does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell, which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
