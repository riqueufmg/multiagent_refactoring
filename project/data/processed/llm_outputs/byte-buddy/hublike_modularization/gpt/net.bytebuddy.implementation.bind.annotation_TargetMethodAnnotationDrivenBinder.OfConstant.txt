    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections; this class does not meet that criterion when considered in isolation."
