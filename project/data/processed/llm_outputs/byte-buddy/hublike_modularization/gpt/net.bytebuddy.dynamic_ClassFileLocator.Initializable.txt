Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. This class has no outgoing dependencies and only a single incoming dependency; although the incoming class (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing dependencies of ClassFileLocator.Initializable in the provided data."
