    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only four direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and has a small set of outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
