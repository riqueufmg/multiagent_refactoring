    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 2 (direct dependencies are net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList). Although the outgoing entry for TypeDescription lists many transitive dependencies, the analyzed class itself has only two direct outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (which requires many incoming and many outgoing relationships)."
