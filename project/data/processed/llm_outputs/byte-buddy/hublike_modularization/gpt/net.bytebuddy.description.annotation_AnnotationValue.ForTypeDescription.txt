    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 3 direct targets — net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription (outgoing target has ~24 dependencies), net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription (outgoing target has ~57 dependencies), and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue (outgoing target has ~18 dependencies). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction itself to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has no incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependency targets, so it does not meet the hub-like modularization criterion."
