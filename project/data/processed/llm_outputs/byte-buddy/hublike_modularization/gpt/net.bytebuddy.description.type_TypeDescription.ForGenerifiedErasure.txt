    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: only 3 direct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only a small number of outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
