    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: two direct dependencies only: net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader and net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription. Although MethodDescription lists many dependent types, those are dependencies of an outgoing dependency, not direct incoming links to this class. Hub-like Modularization requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
