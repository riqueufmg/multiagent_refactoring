    "justification": "TypePool.LazyInterfaceList has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided metrics (outgoing count = 1, incoming count = 0) do not meet that criterion."
