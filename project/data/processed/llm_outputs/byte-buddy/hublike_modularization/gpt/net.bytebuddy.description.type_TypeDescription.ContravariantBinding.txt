    "justification": "No hub-like modularization detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here the incoming set is empty and the outgoing set is small. (Note: the fact that the two referenced classes themselves depend on many others does not make the analyzed class a hub, since its direct in/out-degree remains low.)"
