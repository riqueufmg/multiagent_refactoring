    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependent (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). Although that incoming class lists many dependencies, those are dependencies of ClassInjector, not multiple distinct incoming/outgoing links to ClassInjector.Default. Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction itself to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming_count=1 and outgoing_count=0, so the smell is not present."
