    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList, and net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, but it has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Here incoming_dependencies is empty and the outgoing degree is small (3), so it does not qualify as a hub."
