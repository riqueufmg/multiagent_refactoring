    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class shows low fan-in (0) and low fan-out (2), so it is not a hub."
