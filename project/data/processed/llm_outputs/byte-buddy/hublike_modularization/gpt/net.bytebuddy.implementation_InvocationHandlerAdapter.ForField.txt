    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. For this class: incoming_dependencies = 0 (no classes depend on it). outgoing_dependencies = 5 (depends on StackManipulation, FieldLocator, FieldDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation). Because there are no incoming dependencies and only a small set of outgoing dependencies, the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
