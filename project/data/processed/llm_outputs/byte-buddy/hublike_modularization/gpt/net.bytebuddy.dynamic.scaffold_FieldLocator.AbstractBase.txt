    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no classes depend on this abstraction). Outgoing (direct) dependencies: 2 -> net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Although net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription has many of its own dependencies, FieldLocator.AbstractBase itself has a small number of direct incoming/outgoing ties and no incoming dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like modularization criterion (which requires many incoming and outgoing relationships)."
