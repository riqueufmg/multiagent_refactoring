Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; here both are minimal. Note: MethodDescription lists many of its own dependencies, and MethodGraph lists many dependencies, but those are second-level relations and do not make MethodGraph.Unresolved have a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies."
