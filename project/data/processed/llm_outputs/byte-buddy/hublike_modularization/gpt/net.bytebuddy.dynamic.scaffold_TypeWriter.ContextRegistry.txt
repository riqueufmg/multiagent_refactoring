    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ContextRegistry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one recorded incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter) and one recorded outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows minimal, single links on both sides, so the smell is not present."
