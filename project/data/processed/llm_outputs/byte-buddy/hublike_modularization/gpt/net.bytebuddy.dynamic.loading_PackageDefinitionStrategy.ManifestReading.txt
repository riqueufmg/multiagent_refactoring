    "justification": "Not detected as Hub-like Modularization. The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing edges for the analyzed class in isolation, so the analyzed class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
