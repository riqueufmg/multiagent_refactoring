Incoming dependencies are from a single abstraction: net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription. With only 2 outgoing and 1 incoming dependency (per the provided data), the class does not exhibit the large number of incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
