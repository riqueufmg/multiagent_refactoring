    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; Plugin.ForFile does not meet that criterion. While the outgoing target (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) has many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit numerous incoming or outgoing links."
