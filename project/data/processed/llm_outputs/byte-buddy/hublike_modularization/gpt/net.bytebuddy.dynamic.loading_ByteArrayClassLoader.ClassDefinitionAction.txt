    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing references, so it does not meet the smell criteria. (Although the outgoing targets list many dependencies themselves, those are not incoming to this class and the analysis is limited to the class in isolation.)"
