    "justification": "The class has a small number of connections: 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory) and 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
