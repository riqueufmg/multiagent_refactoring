    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Illegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing dependency count is small, this class does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
