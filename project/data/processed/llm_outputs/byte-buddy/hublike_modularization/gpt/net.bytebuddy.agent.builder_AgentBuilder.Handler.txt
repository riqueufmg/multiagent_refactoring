    "justification": "The class has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and a single incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). These low incoming/outgoing connection counts do not constitute dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization based on the provided data."
