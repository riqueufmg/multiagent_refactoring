    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many dependencies, the analyzed class itself has a single direct outgoing dependency and no incoming dependencies, so it does not qualify as a hub."
