    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForExplicitMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; these counts (incoming=0, outgoing=2) do not meet that criterion. Note: the listed dependency targets themselves have many internal dependencies, but those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of the analyzed class."
