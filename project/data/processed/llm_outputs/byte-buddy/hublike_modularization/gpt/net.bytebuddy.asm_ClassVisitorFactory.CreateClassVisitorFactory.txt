    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and 10 outgoing dependencies (Assigner; MultipleParentClassLoader; ConstructorStrategy; MethodDescription; MethodReturn; DynamicType; MethodCall; ByteBuddy; HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin; Implementation). Because there are no incoming dependencies, it does not satisfy the requirement of having many incoming and outgoing ties and therefore is not a hub."
