    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OfDefaultValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to four abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription) but has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although some outgoing targets themselves reference many types, the analyzed class does not exhibit a high incoming degree and thus does not meet the hub-like criteria."
