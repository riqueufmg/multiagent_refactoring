    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MethodDelegation.Appender is not a hub: incoming_dependencies is empty (0 incoming). It has only 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; in isolation this class lacks incoming links and has a small number (4) of outgoing links, so the hub smell is not present."
