    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to five abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodAccessorFactory, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies prevents this class from being a hub."
