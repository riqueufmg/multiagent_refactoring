    "justification": "The class has only one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criteria. (Although the referenced Implementation class lists many dependencies, those are transitive and do not make StackManipulation.Illegal a hub in isolation.)"
