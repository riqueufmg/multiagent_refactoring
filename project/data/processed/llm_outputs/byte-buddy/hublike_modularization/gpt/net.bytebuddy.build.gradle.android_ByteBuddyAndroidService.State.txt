    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidService.State",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: AndroidDescriptor, ClassFileLocator, Plugin, TypePool, ByteBuddy (5 outgoing edges, each to high-degree abstractions). Incoming dependencies: only one known incoming class (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidService) references this class. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependency relationships. Although ByteBuddyAndroidService.State has multiple outgoing links to heavily connected abstractions, it has only a single incoming dependency in the provided data; therefore it does not meet the criterion of having large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
