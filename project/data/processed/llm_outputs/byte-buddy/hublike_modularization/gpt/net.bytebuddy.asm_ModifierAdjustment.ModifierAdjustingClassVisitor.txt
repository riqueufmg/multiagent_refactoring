    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ModifierAdjustment.ModifierAdjustingClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (3: net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription) and only one incoming dependency (1: net.bytebuddy.asm.ModifierAdjustment). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. While one outgoing dependency (TypeDescription) lists many of its own dependencies, those are transitive and not direct dependencies of the analyzed class; the analysis is constrained to the class in isolation. Therefore the class is not a hub."
