    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FieldAccess.FieldPutInstruction has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing target (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of FieldPutInstruction itself, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
