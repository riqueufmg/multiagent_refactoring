    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is an empty list) and only a single incoming abstraction (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Although Advice depends on many types, ForMethodName is referenced by only one other abstraction and does not itself depend on many others. Hub-like Modularization requires both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies, which is not present here."
