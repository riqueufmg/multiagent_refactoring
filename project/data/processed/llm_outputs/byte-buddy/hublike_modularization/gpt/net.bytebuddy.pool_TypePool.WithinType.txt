    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.WithinType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; the provided data shows few outgoing links and no incoming links, so the smell is not present."
