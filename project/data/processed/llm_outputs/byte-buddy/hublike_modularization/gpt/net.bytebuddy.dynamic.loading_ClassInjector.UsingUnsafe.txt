    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, net.bytebuddy.description.type.PackageDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher (6 distinct outgoing dependencies). Incoming dependencies: only one listed incoming class references this abstraction — net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector (the incoming_dependencies list contains a single entry where ClassInjector depends on ClassInjector.UsingUnsafe). The smell 'Hub-like Modularization' requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. In the provided data UsingUnsafe has a modest number of outgoing dependencies (6) and only a single incoming dependency, so it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
