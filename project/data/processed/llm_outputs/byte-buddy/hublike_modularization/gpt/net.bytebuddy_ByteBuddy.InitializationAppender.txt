    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy.InitializationAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication). Although those outgoing classes themselves reference many other types, the analyzed class lacks the required combination of a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty), so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
