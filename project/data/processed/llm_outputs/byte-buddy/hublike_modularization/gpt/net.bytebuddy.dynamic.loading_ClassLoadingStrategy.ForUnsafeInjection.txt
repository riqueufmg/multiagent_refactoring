    "justification": "The class is not a hub. Incoming dependencies = 0 (none). Outgoing dependencies = 2 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). Although those two target classes have many of their own dependencies, the analyzed class itself has only two outgoing links and no incoming links; hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections."
