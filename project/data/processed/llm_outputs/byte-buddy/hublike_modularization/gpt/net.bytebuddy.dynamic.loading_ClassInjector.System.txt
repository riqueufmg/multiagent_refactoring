    "justification": "Class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector) and one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; those large counts are not present here. Note: JavaDispatcher has many dependencies, but it is a single direct outgoing dependency of ClassInjector.System, so ClassInjector.System is not a hub."
