    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin (listed in analyzed_package.dependencies and outgoing_dependencies contains a single entry for CachedReturnPlugin) and has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Therefore it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
