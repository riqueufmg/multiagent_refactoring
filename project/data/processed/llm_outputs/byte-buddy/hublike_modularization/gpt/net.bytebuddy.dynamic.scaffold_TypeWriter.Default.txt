    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (34 distinct types including net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry, net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, etc.), but it has zero incoming dependencies in the provided data. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Because incoming dependencies are absent, the class does not meet the definition of a hub in this data set."
