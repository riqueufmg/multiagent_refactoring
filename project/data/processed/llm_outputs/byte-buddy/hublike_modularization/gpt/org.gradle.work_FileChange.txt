    "justification": "FileChange has 1 outgoing dependency (org.gradle.work.ChangeType) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
