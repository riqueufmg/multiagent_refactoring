    "justification": "Not detected. The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing links. (While the outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, the smell is evaluated for the analyzed class in isolation.)"
