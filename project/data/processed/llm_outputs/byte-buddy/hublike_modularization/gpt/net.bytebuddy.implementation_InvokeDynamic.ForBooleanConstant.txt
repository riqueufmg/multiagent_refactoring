    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForBooleanConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships; this class lacks incoming dependencies. Although one outgoing target (TypeDescription) itself references many types, the analyzed class does not exhibit both large incoming and outgoing coupling and therefore is not a hub."
