    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList.OfConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here outgoing count = 1 and incoming count = 0, so it is not a hub. (Although ParameterDescription itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of ParameterList.OfConstructor.)"
