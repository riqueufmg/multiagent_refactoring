    "justification": "Direct outgoing dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). Direct incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only a single incoming and a single outgoing dependency for this class. Note: MethodDescription lists many dependencies, but those are indirect and not listed as direct dependencies of ParameterDescription.InGenericShape in the provided data."
