    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Loader has no outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only a single incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Although AgentBuilder references many other types, AgentBuilder.Loader itself does not have many incoming or outgoing relationships; therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
