    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No — Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation. Although those target classes themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing links, so it is not a hub."
