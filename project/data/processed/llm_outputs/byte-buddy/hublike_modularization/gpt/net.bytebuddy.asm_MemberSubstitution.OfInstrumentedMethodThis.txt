    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfInstrumentedMethodThis",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner) and a single incoming depender (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Although MemberSubstitution references many types, the analyzed class itself is referenced by only that one class and directly depends on only Assigner, so it does not exhibit hub-like connectivity."
