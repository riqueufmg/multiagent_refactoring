    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 8 distinct abstractions (Assigner; AnnotationDescription; MethodDescription; ParameterDescription; JavaConstant; JavaType; HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin; TypeDescription). Incoming dependencies: a single client abstraction (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution) references this class. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections. Here the incoming degree is very low (1) and the outgoing degree is moderate (8), so the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
