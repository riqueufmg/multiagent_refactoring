    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = 0) and a limited set of outgoing dependencies (7 distinct abstractions) — MethodDescription, ParameterList, AnnotationList, AccessControllerPlugin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, and JavaDispatcher. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not meet that criterion."
