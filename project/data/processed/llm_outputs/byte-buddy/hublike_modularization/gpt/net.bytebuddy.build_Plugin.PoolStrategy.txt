    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and many outgoing). Although net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool (the referenced outgoing) itself lists many dependencies, Plugin.PoolStrategy only directly depends on that one abstraction and is only referenced by Plugin, so it does not meet the hub-like pattern."
