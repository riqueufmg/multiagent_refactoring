    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.OfMethodHandleDesc",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has only one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and only one direct incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant referencing OfMethodHandleDesc). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Here the counts are low (1 incoming, 1 outgoing). Note: JavaDispatcher's many dependencies are dependencies of that referenced class, not direct dependencies of OfMethodHandleDesc, so they do not make OfMethodHandleDesc a hub."
