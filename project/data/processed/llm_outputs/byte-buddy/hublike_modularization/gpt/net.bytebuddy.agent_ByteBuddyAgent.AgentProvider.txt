    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.Installer) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent). Although ByteBuddyAgent itself lists many dependencies, only a single incoming edge to AgentProvider is present in the provided data, so AgentProvider is not a hub."
