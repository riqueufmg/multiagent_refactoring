    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies only to net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList and net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool (out-degree = 2) and has no incoming dependencies listed (in-degree = 0). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing ties with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
