    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies (4): net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription. Incoming dependencies (1): net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder. Both the number of distinct incoming abstractions (1) and outgoing abstractions (4) are small and do not constitute a large number of bi-directional connections. Although some target classes have many internal dependencies, the analysis of this class in isolation shows it is not a hub-like module."
