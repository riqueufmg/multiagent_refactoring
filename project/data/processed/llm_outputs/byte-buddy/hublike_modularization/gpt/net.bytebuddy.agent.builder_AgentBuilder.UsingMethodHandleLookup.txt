    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although AgentBuilder lists many dependencies, UsingMethodHandleLookup itself does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing relations in the provided data, so it is not a hub."
