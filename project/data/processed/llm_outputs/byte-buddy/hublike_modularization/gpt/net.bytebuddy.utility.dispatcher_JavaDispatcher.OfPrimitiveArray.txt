    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.OfPrimitiveArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Although JavaDispatcher has many dependencies, OfPrimitiveArray itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing links, so it is not a hub."
