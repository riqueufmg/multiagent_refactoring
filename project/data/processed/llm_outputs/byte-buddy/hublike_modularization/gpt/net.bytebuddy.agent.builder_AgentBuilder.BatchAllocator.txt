    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.BatchAllocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and only 1 incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependency connections; the provided data shows neither a large number of incoming dependents nor a large number of direct outgoing dependencies. Note: although one outgoing target (TypeDescription) itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of BatchAllocator and therefore do not make BatchAllocator a hub in the provided, isolated context."
