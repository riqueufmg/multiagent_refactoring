    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Eager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Plugin.Eager has a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although TypePool lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing relations of Plugin.Eager when the class is considered in isolation, so it is not a hub."
