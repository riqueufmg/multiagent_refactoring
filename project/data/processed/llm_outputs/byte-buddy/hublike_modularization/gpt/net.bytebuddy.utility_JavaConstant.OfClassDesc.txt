    "justification": "The class has a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies with numerous other abstractions; the provided data shows only one incoming and one outgoing relationship, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell. Note: JavaDispatcher's many dependencies are dependencies of that target class, not direct incoming/outgoing links of OfClassDesc itself."
