    "justification": "The class has only a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator). With only 1 incoming and 1 outgoing abstraction referenced in the provided data, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions)."
