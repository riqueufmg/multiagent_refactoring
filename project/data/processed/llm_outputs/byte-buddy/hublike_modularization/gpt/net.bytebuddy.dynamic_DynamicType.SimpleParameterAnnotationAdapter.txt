    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.SimpleParameterAnnotationAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows only a small number of outgoing links and no incoming links, so the hub-like smell is not present."
