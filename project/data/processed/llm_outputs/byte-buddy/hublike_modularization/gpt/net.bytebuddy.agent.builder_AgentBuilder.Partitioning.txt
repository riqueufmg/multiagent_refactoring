    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many of its own dependencies, those are transitive and do not increase the analyzed class's direct incoming/outgoing counts. Therefore this class is not a hub."
