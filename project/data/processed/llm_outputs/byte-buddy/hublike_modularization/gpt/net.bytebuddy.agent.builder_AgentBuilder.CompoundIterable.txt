    "justification": "AgentBuilder.CompoundIterable has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here both counts are low. Although the outgoing target (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself depends on many classes, those are not direct dependencies of AgentBuilder.CompoundIterable in the provided data, so the class is not a hub."
