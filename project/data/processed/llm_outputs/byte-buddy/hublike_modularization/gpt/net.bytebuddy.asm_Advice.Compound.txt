    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows neither a large outgoing fan‑out nor any incoming fan‑in for this class."
