    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.Transformation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. For Transformation the provided data shows only a single outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin (1 outgoing). Incoming dependencies are from three classes: net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo, net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.Transformer, and net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.ForConfiguredPlugin (3 incoming). Because the outgoing dependency count is very low (1) and the incoming count is modest (3), Transformation does not meet the criterion of having a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Note: although net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin itself references many types, the analysis is limited to Transformation in isolation and therefore Plugin's internal dependencies are not counted toward Transformation's outgoing dependency count."
