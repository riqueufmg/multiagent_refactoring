    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ModifierContributor has a large number of incoming dependencies (46 distinct clients reference it, e.g. net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Builder, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy and many modifier subtypes such as Visibility, Ownership, FieldManifestation). However, it has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor.ForModule). The hub-like modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the incoming degree is high but the outgoing degree is very low, so the class does not satisfy the 'both many incoming and many outgoing' condition and is not detected as hub-like."
