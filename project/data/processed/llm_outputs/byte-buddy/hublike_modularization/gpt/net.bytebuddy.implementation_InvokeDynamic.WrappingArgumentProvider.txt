    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). The smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class lacks incoming dependencies and does not exhibit a large number of direct outgoing dependencies."
