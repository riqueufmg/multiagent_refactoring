    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 5 direct targets — net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has outgoing links but no incoming links, so it is not a hub."
