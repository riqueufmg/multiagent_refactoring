    "justification": "MethodVariableAccess exhibits hub-like modularization: it has a high out-degree (11 outgoing dependencies: MethodVariableAccess.TypeCastingHandler, TypeDefinition, MethodDescription, MethodVariableAccess.NoOp, StackManipulation, ParameterDescription, StackSize, CachedReturnPlugin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation, MethodVariableAccess.MethodLoading) and a high in-degree (27 incoming dependents including net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice (and many Advice inner types), net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution (and many subtypes), net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.EqualsMethod (and related checks/appender), net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder (and related appenders/proxies), net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.BindingMechanic, etc.). The class therefore has both many incoming and many outgoing connections across diverse subsystems, matching the hub-like modularization smell."
