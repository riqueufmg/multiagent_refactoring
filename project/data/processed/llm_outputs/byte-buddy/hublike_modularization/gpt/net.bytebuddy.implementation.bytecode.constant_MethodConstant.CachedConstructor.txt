    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.MethodConstant.CachedConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming count is zero and the outgoing count is small (3). Although the referenced classes themselves list many dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit a large fan-in and fan-out and therefore is not a hub."
