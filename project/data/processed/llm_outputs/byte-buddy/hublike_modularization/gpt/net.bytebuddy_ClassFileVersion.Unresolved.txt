    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion.Unresolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires the class to have both numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin has many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of ClassFileVersion.Unresolved. Given incoming=0 and outgoing=1, it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
