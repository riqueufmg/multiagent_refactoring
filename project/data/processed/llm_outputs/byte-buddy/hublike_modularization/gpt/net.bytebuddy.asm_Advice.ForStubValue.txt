Outgoing dependencies (4): net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription. Incoming dependencies (1): net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice. Although one outgoing target (TypeDescription) lists many internal dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links to Advice.ForStubValue in the provided data. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
