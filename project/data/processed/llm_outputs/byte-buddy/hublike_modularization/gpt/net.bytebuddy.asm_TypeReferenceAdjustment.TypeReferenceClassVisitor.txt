    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeReferenceAdjustment.TypeReferenceClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, and net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher. Although net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool itself depends on many other types, those are transitive dependencies of TypePool, not direct incoming dependencies to the analyzed class. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
