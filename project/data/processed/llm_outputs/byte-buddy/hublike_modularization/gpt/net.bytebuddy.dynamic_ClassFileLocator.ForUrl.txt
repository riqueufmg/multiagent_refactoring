    "justification": "The class is not a hub: incoming_dependencies is empty (no classes depend on it) and it has only three outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
