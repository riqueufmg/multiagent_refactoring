    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion (incoming count = 1, outgoing count = 0). Note that the long dependency list belongs to the incoming class, not to FieldAccessor.ForBeanProperty itself."
