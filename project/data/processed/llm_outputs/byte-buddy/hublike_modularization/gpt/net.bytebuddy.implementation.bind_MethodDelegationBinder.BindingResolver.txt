    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; these counts are low and do not indicate a hub."
