Outgoing dependencies: 2 direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class has no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
