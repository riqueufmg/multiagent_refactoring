    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Nexus",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Nexus has no outgoing dependencies (empty dependency list) and only three incoming dependents: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor.Dispatcher, and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor.CreationAction. A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; Nexus does not meet this criterion (0 outgoing, 3 incoming), so the smell is not detected."
