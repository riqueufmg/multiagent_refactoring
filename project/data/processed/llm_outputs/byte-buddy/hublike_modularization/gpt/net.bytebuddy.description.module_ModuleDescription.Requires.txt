    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; the provided data does not show many incoming or outgoing links for this class."
