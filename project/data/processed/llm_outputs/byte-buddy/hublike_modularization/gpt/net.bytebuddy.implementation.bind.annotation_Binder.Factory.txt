    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization is not detected: the class has a small number of outgoing dependencies (3: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder). There is no evidence in the provided data of dependencies to or from a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
