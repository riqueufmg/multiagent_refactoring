    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships; the provided data shows small counts (incoming=1, outgoing=2), so this is not a hub."
