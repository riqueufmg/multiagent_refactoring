    "justification": "ClassInjector.AccessResolver has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here neither the incoming count (1) nor the outgoing count (0) is large. The long dependency list belongs to ClassInjector, not to AccessResolver."
