    "detection": true,
    "justification": "TypeDefinition has a large number of both outgoing and incoming dependencies. Outgoing: the analyzed entry lists 11 direct dependencies (e.g. TypeDefinition.AnnotatedType, TypeDefinition.Sort, RecordComponentList, MethodList, FieldList, StackSize, AccessControllerPlugin, TypeList, TypeDescription, JavaDispatcher, ModifierReviewable). Incoming: nearly 100 distinct classes reference TypeDefinition (examples include high-level consumers such as net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType and its Builder/AbstractBase, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice and many of its nested types, net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution and its nested types, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers, and many implementation/bytecode classes like MethodCall, InvokeDynamic, Removal, Duplication, FieldAccess, MethodReturn). The combination of many outgoing ties to core type abstractions (TypeDescription, TypeList, MethodList, FieldList, etc.) and a very large in-degree from diverse subsystems (dynamic, asm, implementation, matcher, utility) matches the Hub-like Modularization smell (an abstraction acting as a central hub with widespread incoming and outgoing coupling)."
