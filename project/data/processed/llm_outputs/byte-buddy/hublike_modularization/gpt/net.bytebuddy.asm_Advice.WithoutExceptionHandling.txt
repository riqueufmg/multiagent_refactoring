    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. Although the referenced Implementation type has many internal dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies."
