    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.AbstractPropertyAccessorMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing count = 1 and incoming count = 0, so this class is not a hub. Note: MethodDescription lists many of its own dependencies, but they are not direct incoming/outgoing links of the analyzed class per the provided data."
