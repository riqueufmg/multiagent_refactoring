    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer.ForJava9CapableVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin has many of its own dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies (outgoing count = 1, incoming count = 0), so it is not a hub."
