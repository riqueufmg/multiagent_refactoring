    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Stubbing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of outgoing dependencies (4): net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation. It has a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution (one referring abstraction). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; here Stubbing has few outgoing links and only one incoming link, so it does not qualify as a hub."
