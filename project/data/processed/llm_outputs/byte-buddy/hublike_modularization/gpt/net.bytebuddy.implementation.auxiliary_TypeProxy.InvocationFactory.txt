    "justification": "InvocationFactory has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) and 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy) according to the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; those large numbers are not present here. Although the referenced Implementation class has many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links for InvocationFactory in the given context, and the analysis is constrained to the provided dependencies only."
