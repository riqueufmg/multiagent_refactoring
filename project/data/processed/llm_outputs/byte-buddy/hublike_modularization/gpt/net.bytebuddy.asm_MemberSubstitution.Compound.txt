    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MemberSubstitution.Compound has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing target HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself depends on many classes (e.g., MethodAttributeAppender, AnnotationDescription, MethodDescription, AnnotationOrderComparator, Sort, ElementMatchers, AnnotationValueFilter, ClassFileLocator, EqualsMethod, Plugin, DynamicType, InvokeSuper, FieldDescription, ValueMatcher, ElementMatcher, TypeDescription), these are not direct incoming/outgoing relations of MemberSubstitution.Compound. Therefore the class is not a hub."
