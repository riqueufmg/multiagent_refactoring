    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.IncompleteToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and only one direct incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Although HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many dependencies, those are transitive from that single outgoing edge. The provided data shows no large number of distinct incoming and outgoing direct dependencies for TypePool.IncompleteToken, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
