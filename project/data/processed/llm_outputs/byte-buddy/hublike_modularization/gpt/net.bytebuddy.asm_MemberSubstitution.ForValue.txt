    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has outgoing dependencies to 5 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) but has 0 incoming dependencies. The lack of incoming dependencies means it does not meet the 'both incoming and outgoing with many abstractions' criterion for a hub-like module."
