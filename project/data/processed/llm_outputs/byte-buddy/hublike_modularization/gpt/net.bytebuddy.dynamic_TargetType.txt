    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TargetType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "TargetType is referenced by a large number of other abstractions (high fan-in): examples from incoming dependencies include net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Builder, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.AbstractBase, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType (and its Factory and Default), net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy (and ByteBuddy.EnumerationImplementation), and several net.bytebuddy.description.type.* classes (TypeDescription, TypeDescription.Generic, TypeDescription.Visitor, TypeDescription.Substitutor, TypeDescription.ForDetachment). On the outgoing side TargetType directly depends on net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and that TypeDescription entry itself lists a very large set of collaborators (e.g. TypeDescription.WithEagerNavigation, OfParameterizedType, TypeDefinition, ParameterAssigner, AnnotatedParameterizedType, TypeVariableSource, AnnotationStripper, StackSize, JavaType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Substitutor, RenderingDelegate, ForLoadedType, Dispatcher, Builder, TypeList, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, AnnotationList, ElementMatcher, and many others). The combination of many incoming references to TargetType plus its outgoing linkage to a TypeDescription that touches many additional abstractions indicates TargetType behaves as a hub-like abstraction."
