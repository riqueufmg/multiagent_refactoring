    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator). A hub requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not meet that criterion."
