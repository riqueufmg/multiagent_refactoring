    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no incoming references). Outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription). Although the two outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists 16 dependencies; ModuleDescription lists 11), the analyzed class only directly depends on two abstractions and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships, which is not the case here."
