    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Processor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not exhibit many incoming links and has a small number of direct outgoing links, so it is not a hub."
