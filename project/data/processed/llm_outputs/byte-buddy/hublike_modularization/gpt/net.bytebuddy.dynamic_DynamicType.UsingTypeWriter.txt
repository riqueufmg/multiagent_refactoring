    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.UsingTypeWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). Although that target (DynamicType) lists many dependencies, the class itself is not directly connected to a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
