    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AnnotationValue.Loaded has a small set of direct relations: outgoing dependencies to net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue (3 distinct outgoing), and a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue (1 incoming). Although one outgoing target (TypeDescription) itself references many classes, AnnotationValue.Loaded does not directly depend on a large number of different abstractions nor is it directly depended on by many abstractions, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
