    "justification": "Duplication is referenced by a very large number of other abstractions: 55 incoming classes in the provided data (examples: net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder). At the same time it has outgoing dependencies to multiple core abstractions (5 outgoing: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication.WithFlip, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). The combination of a very high incoming fan-in (many clients depending on Duplication) together with outgoing ties to several widely-used core types (StackManipulation, StackSize, Implementation, TypeDefinition) matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
