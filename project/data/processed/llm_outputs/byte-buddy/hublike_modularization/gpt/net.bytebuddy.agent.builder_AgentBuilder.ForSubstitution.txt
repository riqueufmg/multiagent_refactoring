    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForSubstitution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although ResettableClassFileTransformer (the single outgoing dependency) itself has many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of AgentBuilder.ForSubstitution per the provided data, so the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
