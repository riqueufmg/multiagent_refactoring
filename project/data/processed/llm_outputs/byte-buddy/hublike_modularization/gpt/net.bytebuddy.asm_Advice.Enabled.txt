Outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has neither a large incoming dependency set nor a large outgoing dependency set; therefore it is not a hub."
