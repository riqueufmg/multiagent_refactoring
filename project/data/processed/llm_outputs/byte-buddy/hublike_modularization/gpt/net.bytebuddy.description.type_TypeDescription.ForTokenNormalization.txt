    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForTokenNormalization",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. While net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription itself references many types, those are transitive dependencies of a dependency, not direct incoming/outgoing links of ForTokenNormalization. Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing direct dependencies, which is not the case here."
