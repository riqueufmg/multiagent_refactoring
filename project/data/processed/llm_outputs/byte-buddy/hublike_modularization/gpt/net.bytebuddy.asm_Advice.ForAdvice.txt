    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited (5 distinct targets: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Incoming dependencies are minimal (only one provided incoming class: net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows a small, focused set of incoming and outgoing links, so the smell is not present."
