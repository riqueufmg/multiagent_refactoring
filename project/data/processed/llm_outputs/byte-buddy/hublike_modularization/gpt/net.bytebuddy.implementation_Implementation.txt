    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits hub-like modularization: it has a large set of outgoing dependencies (33 distinct types listed in the analyzed_package.dependencies, e.g. net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and is referenced by many other abstractions (numerous incoming dependencies across packages shown in incoming_dependencies). Examples of incoming dependents include high-level components such as net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter (and many of its inner types), net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper (and its variants), net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder (and its variants), net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, and a large set of net.bytebuddy.implementation.* classes (MethodCall, MethodDelegation, FieldAccessor, SuperMethodCall, many bytecode helpers, auxiliary types, binders, etc.). The combination of many outgoing links to diverse abstractions and many incoming links from diverse clients matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
