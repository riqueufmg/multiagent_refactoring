    "justification": "Advice.Disabled has a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) and a single incoming dependency origin (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; Advice.Disabled does not meet this criterion."
