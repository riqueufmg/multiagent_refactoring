    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Harmonizer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one direct outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription. It has a single direct incoming dependency shown: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph (which lists MethodGraph.Harmonizer among its dependencies). Although MethodDescription (the outgoing target) itself depends on many other types, those are transitive/indirect and, per the requirement to consider the class in isolation, do not make Harmonizer a hub. A hub-like modularization requires the abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing direct dependencies; Harmonizer has low counts for both (1 incoming, 1 outgoing)."
