    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer.Callback",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency (only net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer references it). Although ResettableClassFileTransformer itself depends on many abstractions, ResettableClassFileTransformer.Callback does not have incoming/outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
