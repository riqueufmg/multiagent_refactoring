    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ShiftRight.Unsigned",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ShiftRight.Unsigned has 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ShiftRight) and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. The direct fan-in (1) and fan-out (2) are small. Although the outgoing dependency Implementation itself references many types, those are transitive and do not increase the direct dependency counts for ShiftRight.Unsigned given the provided data."
