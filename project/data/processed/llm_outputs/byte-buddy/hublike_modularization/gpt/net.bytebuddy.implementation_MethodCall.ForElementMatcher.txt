    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForElementMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (4: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and a single incoming dependency entry (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Given only one incoming dependent and four direct outgoing dependencies, this class does not meet the 'large number of both incoming and outgoing' criterion and therefore is not a hub."
