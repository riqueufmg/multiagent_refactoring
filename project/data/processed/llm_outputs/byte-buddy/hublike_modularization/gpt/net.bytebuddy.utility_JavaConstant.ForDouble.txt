    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.ForDouble",

    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced TypeDescription itself depends on many classes (56 listed), the analyzed class in isolation only directly depends on a single abstraction and has no incoming dependencies, so it is not a hub."
