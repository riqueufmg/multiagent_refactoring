    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) but has 0 incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; because incoming dependencies are absent, this class does not qualify as a hub."
