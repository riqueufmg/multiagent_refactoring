    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class lacks incoming dependencies and has only a small number of outgoing dependencies. While the outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, that does not make this class a hub when considered in isolation."
