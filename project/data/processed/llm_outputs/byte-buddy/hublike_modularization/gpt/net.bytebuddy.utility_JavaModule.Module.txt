    "justification": "The class has a low number of both incoming and outgoing relationships: only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and only one incoming dependent (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low in-degree and out-degree, so the smell is not detected."
