    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall) and 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator). Because it does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships, it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
