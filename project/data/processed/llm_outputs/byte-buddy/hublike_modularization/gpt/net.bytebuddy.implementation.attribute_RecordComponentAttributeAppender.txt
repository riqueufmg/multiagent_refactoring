    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.RecordComponentAttributeAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has a large number of incoming dependencies (18 distinct dependents, e.g. net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Builder, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.RecordComponentRegistry, etc.), but only 4 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter. Because the outgoing dependency set is small while only the incoming set is large, the class does not meet the criterion of having large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies and therefore is not detected as hub-like modularization."
