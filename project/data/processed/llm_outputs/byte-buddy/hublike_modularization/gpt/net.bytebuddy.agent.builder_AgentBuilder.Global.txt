    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and outgoing); this class does not meet that criterion."
