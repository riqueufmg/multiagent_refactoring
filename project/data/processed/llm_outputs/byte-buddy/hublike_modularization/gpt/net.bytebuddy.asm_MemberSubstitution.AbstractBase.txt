    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Incoming dependencies are empty (incoming_dependencies: []). The class has direct outgoing dependencies to four abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, and net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription. Although those outgoing targets themselves reference many other types, the analyzed class lacks incoming coupling. Hub-like Modularization requires large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because incoming dependencies = 0, this class does not meet the hub-like criterion."
