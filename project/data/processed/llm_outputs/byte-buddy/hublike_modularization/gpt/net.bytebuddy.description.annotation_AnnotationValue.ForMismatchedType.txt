    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections. Although the two outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, the analysis is limited to the class in isolation and its direct incoming/outgoing links, which do not indicate a hub."
