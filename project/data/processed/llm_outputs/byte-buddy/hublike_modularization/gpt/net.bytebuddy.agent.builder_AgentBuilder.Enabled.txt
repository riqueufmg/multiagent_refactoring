    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Enabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Enabled has zero incoming dependencies and only four outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and its outgoing fan-out is small, so the smell is not present."
