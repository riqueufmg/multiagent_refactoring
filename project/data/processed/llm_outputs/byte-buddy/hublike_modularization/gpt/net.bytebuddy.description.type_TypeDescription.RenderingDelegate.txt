    "detection": false,
    "justification": "RenderingDelegate has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion) and only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies to and from a large number of other abstractions. Although ClassFileVersion (the outgoing target) itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of RenderingDelegate per the provided data. Therefore RenderingDelegate does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
