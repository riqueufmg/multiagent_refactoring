    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 3 direct dependencies — net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has zero incoming and only three outgoing direct dependencies (a small number). Therefore it is not a hub-like modularization (analysis considered the class in isolation)."
