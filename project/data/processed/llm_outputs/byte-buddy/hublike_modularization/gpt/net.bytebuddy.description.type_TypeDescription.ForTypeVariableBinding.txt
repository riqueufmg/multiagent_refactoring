    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList. However, its incoming_dependencies list is empty (0). Because there are no incoming dependencies, the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization despite having multiple outgoing links."
