    "justification": "Not detected: ClassInjector.MethodHandles has a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). Although JavaDispatcher itself lists many dependencies, MethodHandles directly depends only on JavaDispatcher and is directly referenced by only ClassInjector, so it does not exhibit large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies required for a hub-like modularization."
