    "justification": "Not detected: the class has a small number of direct dependencies. Outgoing dependencies (3): net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize. Incoming dependencies (1): net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships; this class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming/outgoing dependencies. (Although its outgoing targets are themselves highly connected, the analysis considers the class in isolation and does not count transitive connections.)"
