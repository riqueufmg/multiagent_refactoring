    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []), and only two outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 2. (Note: the two outgoing targets themselves reference many types—HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin has 16 dependencies and Implementation has 32—but that does not make this class a hub because it lacks many incoming dependencies.)"
