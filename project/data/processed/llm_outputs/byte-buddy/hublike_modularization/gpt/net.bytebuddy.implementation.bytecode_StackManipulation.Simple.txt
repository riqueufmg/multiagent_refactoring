    "justification": "Not detected: Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation. The lack of incoming dependencies and the small number of outgoing dependencies do not meet the hub-like criteria."
