    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Formal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypePool.Formal has outgoing dependencies to four abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, and net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool. It has zero incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although some outgoing targets (e.g., TypePool, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) themselves reference many classes, TypePool.Formal itself exhibits only 4 outgoing links and no incoming links, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
