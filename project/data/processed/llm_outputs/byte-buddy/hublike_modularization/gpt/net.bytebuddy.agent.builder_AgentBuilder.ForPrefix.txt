    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 2 other abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodNameTransformer) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here the connection counts (outgoing=2, incoming=0) are low, so the smell is not detected."
