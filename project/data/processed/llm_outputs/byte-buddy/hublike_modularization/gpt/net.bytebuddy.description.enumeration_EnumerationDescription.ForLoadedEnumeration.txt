    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Although that target class has many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class; per the isolation constraint only direct incoming/outgoing relations are considered. Therefore the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
