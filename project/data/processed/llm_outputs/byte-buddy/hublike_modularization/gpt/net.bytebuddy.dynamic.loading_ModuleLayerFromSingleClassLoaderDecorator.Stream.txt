    "justification": "The class has only one direct outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, and only one incoming dependency recorded: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links to a large number of other abstractions; the direct dependency counts here are low, so this is not a hub."
