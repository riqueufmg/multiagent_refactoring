    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine). Outgoing dependencies: 0 (none). Although net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine itself depends on many classes (e.g., ForJnaSolarisDoor, WindowsLibrary, Factory, PosixOwnerProvider, SolarisLibrary, Dispatcher, ForJnaWindowsNamedPipe, WindowsAttachLibrary, ForJnaPosixSocket, Connection, PosixLibrary, MacLibrary), the analyzed class (VirtualMachine.Dispatcher) has only a single incoming dependency and no outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and/or outgoing relationships with other abstractions, which is not the case here."
