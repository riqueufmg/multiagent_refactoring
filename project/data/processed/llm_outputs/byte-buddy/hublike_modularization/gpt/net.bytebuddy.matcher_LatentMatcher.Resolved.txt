    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. For net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher.Resolved the incoming_dependencies list is empty and the outgoing dependencies are only two abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher. Because there are no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing dependencies, this class does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
