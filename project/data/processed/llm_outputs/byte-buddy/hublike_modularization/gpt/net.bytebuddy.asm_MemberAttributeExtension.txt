    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MemberAttributeExtension has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (10): MethodAttributeAppender, OpenedClassReader, MethodDescription, AnnotationValueFilter, AnnotationList, FieldDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AsmVisitorWrapper, FieldAttributeAppender, Implementation. However, it has only 2 incoming dependencies (DispatcherAnnotationPlugin, SafeVarargsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections. Because incoming dependencies are low while outgoing are moderate, the class does not meet the hub-like pattern based on the provided data."
