    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are numerous (13 distinct referenced abstractions: TypeList, RecordComponentDescription, MethodDescription, FieldList, MethodList, RecordComponentList, StackSize, ClassFileVersion, CachedReturnPlugin, FieldDescription, AnnotationList, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AnnotationSource, TypeDescription), but incoming dependencies are minimal (only one incoming class: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription references OfParameterizedType). Hub-like modularization requires the abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the incoming fan-in is not large (single incoming), so the class does not meet the hub-like criterion."
