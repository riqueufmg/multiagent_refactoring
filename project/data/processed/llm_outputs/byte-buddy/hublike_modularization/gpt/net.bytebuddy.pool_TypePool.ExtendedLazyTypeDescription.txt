    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Although those outgoing dependencies themselves reference many other types, the smell 'Hub-like Modularization' requires the abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class lacks incoming relationships and has only a small number of direct outgoing dependencies."
