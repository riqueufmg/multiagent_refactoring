    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
