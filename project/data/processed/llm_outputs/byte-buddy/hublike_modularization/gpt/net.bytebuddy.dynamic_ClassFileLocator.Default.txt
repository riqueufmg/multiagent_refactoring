    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition."
