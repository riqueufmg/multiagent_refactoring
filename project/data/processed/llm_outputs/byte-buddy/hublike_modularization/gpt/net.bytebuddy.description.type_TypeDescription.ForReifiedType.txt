    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. This class has outgoing dependencies to 6 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList) but has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Because there are no incoming dependencies (and the number of outgoing dependencies is modest), the hub-like modularization smell is not detected."
