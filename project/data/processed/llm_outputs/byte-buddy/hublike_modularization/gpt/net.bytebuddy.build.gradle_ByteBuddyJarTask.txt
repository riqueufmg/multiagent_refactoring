    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ByteBuddyJarTask has only two direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin and org.gradle.api.tasks.PathSensitivity) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyJarTaskExtension). Although net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin itself lists many related types, those are dependencies of Plugin, not direct dependencies of ByteBuddyJarTask. Given the low number of direct incoming and outgoing connections, the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
