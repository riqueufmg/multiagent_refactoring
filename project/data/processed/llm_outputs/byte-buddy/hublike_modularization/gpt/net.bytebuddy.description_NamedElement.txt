    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 11 (examples: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription). Outgoing dependencies: 0. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although NamedElement has a large number of incoming dependencies (high in-degree), it has no outgoing dependencies (out-degree = 0), so it does not meet the 'both incoming and outgoing' condition for Hub-like Modularization."
