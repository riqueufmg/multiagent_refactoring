Outgoing direct dependencies = 4 (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, Implementation), which is not a large number. Although those outgoing targets themselves reference many types, the analyzed class does not exhibit both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies required for Hub-like Modularization."
