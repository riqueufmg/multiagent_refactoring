    "justification": "incoming_dependencies is empty (no classes depend on net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.OptionalMethodMatchAdapter). The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, and net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependency relations; this class lacks incoming relations and has a small number of outgoing relations, so the smell is not present."
