    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 10 distinct abstractions (e.g. Assigner, AnnotationDescription, TypeDefinition, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, JavaConstant, JavaType, TypeList, TypeDescription, ParameterDescription). Incoming dependencies: only 1 provided (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing links; here the class has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (10) but only a single incoming dependency, so it does not exhibit a hub-like coupling pattern."
