    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and thus does not meet the smell's criteria."
