    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Because it lacks a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships (only a single outgoing link and no incoming links), it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
