    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections to many other abstractions; this class does not exhibit that pattern."
