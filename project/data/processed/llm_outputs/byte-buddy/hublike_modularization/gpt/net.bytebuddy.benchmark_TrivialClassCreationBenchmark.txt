    "justification": "Not detected: the class has outgoing dependencies to only three abstractions (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeValidation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 3 (small), so the smell is not present."
