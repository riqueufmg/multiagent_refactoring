    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
