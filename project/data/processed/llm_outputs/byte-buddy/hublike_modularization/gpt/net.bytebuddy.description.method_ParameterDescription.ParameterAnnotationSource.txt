    "justification": "The class has only one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and only one direct incoming dependency source (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription). Because it does not have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
