    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "AsmVisitorWrapper exhibits hub-like modularization: it has numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies. Outgoing: it directly depends on many core abstractions (OpenedClassReader, MethodDescription, FieldList, MethodList, TypePool, FieldDescription, ElementMatcher, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation, TypeDescription). Incoming: a large set of distinct classes depend on it (examples: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType and its variants (Builder, AbstractBase, Adapter), net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter (and many TypeWriter variants such as Default, ForInlining, ForCreation), net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder (and Transformer, ForAdvice), net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice (and Default, Appender, StackMapFrameHandler), net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution, MemberAttributeExtension (and its ForField/ForMethod), multiple build plugins (AccessControllerPlugin, RenamingPlugin), and utility dispatchers (JavaDispatcher and DynamicClassLoader)). Counts from the provided data: 10 distinct outgoing dependencies and 33 distinct incoming dependents, indicating the class is a central hub connecting many other abstractions."
