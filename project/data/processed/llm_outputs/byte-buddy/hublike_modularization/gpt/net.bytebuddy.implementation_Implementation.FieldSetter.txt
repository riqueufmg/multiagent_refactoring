    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Implementation.FieldSetter has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue) but has zero incoming dependencies. Because the incoming dependency count is 0, it does not meet the definition of a hub (which requires substantial both-way coupling)."
