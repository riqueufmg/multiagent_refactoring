    "justification": "Plugin.ForFailedElement has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. Although TypeDescription itself is highly connected (it lists many dependencies), the analyzed class references only that single abstraction and therefore does not qualify as a hub."
