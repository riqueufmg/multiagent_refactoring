    "detection": false,
    "justification": "RebaseImplementationTarget has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (10 distinct abstractions: MethodGraph, MethodDescription, MethodRebaseResolver, StackManipulation, ClassFileVersion, JavaConstant, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeList, TypeDescription, Implementation) but only 2 incoming dependents in the provided data (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Default). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections; here the incoming fan-in is low, so the class does not qualify as a hub based on the given metrics."
