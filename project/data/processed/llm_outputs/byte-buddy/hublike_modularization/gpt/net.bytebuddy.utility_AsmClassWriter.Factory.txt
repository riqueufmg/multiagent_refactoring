    "justification": "The class has a limited number of direct relationships in the provided data: 6 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader) and a single incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not show a large number of direct incoming or outgoing connections in the provided dataset. Therefore it is not detected as hub-like."
