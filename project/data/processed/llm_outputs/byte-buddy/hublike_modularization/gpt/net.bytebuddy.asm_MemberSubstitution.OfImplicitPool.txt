    "justification": "The class has 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not. Note: net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution itself depends on many types, but those are not outgoing dependencies of MemberSubstitution.OfImplicitPool, so the class is not a hub."
