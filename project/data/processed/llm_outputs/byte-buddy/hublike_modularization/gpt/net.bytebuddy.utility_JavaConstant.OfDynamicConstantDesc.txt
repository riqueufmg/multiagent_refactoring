    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.OfDynamicConstantDesc",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher (1). It has only one incoming dependency recorded: net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant (1). Although the referenced JavaDispatcher and JavaConstant list many of their own dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of distinct incoming or outgoing relationships, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization criterion."
