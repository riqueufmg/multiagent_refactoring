    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Graph",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Given the provided data and the requirement to analyze the class in isolation, the counts (outgoing=2, incoming=0) do not meet the 'large number' criterion."
