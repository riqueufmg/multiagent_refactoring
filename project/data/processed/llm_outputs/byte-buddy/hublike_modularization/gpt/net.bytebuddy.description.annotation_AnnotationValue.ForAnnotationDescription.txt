    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; the absence of incoming dependencies prevents this class from being a hub."
