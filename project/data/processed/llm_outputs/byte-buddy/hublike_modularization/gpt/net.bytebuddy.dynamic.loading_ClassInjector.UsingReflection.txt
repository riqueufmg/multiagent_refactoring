    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has many outgoing dependencies (9): TypeValidation, Visibility, ClassLoadingStrategy, ConstructorStrategy, PackageDefinitionStrategy, DynamicType, AccessControllerPlugin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, JavaDispatcher. However, it has zero incoming dependencies (0). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because incoming dependencies are absent, the smell is not present."
