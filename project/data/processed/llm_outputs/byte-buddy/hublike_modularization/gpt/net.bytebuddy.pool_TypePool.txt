    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "TypePool exhibits hub-like modularization: it has a very large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies in the provided data. Incoming: ~101 distinct classes depend on TypePool (examples: net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter and many net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.* inner/related classes). Outgoing: TypePool depends on ~66 distinct abstractions (examples: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader and many TypePool inner tokens such as TypePool.GenericTypeToken, TypePool.AnnotationToken). The presence of both a high indegree (~101 incoming) and a high outdegree (~66 outgoing), spanning many packages and many internal TypePool components, indicates it functions as a central hub and therefore matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
