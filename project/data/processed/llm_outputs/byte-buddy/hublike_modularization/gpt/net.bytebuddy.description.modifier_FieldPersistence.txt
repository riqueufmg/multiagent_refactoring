    "justification": "FieldPersistence has a low degree of coupling in the provided data: it has a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor) and only three incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable, net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase). Although those incoming classes reference many other modifier types, FieldPersistence itself is connected to only four other abstractions in total, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
