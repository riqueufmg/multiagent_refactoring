    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.AnnotationToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AnnotationToken has a small number of direct dependencies: outgoing = 3 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and incoming = 1 (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Although there is a bidirectional link with TypePool, the class does not have incoming and outgoing relations with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
