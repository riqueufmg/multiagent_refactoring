    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections; here incoming is empty and outgoing is small, so it does not qualify as a hub."
