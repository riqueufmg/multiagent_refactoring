    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. MethodCallProxy has a large number of outgoing dependencies (21 distinct referenced abstractions such as net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeValidation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, etc.). However, it has only a single incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder). Because the class does not exhibit a large number of incoming dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
