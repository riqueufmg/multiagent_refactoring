    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.DecorationClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only four direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer). While some of those depend on many other types, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships required to qualify as hub-like modularization."
