    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Although CachedReturnPlugin lists many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not have many direct incoming or outgoing relationships (outgoing=1, incoming=0), so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
