    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.TypeLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Binder.TypeLocator has only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder). Although the two referenced types themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation is directly connected to only a small number of other abstractions, so it does not meet the hub-like modularization criterion."
