    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing dependency TypeList itself depends on multiple types, the analyzed class's direct dependency counts (incoming=0, outgoing=1) are too low to qualify as a hub."
