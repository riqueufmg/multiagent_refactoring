    "justification": "Plugin.Filtering has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; the absence of incoming dependencies means this class does not qualify as a hub."
