    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only outgoing dependencies to a limited set of six abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies and the modest number of outgoing links rule out this smell."
