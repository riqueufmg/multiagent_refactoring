    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForInstrumentedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation (listed in outgoing_dependencies). It has a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall (listed in incoming_dependencies). Although the referenced Implementation class itself depends on many other types, MethodCall.ForInstrumentedMethod does not directly have a large number of incoming and outgoing connections to other abstractions, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
