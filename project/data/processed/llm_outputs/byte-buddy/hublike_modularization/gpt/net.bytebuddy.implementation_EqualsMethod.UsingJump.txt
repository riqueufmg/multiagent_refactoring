    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and only 1 incoming dependency reported (net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relations; the provided data shows a small number of both incoming and outgoing connections, so the smell is not detected."
