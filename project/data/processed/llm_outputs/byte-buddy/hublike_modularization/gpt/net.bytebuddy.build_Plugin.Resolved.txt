    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Resolved",

    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies exist to 5 distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) but there are 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Here incoming_dependencies is empty, so the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization despite its outgoing links."
