Outgoing dependencies: Advice.ForHandle directly depends on 7 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Total distinct adjacency (incoming + outgoing) = 8. Under the provided, isolated data this number of incoming and outgoing links is not a large number and therefore does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria. Note: several of the outgoing types themselves have many dependencies, but those are indirect and outside the class-in-isolation connectivity considered here."
