Outgoing dependencies (6): net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodAccessorFactory, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only six outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like modularization smell."
