    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.StringSetMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StringSetMatcher has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing links. Although HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many of its own dependencies, those are transitive and the analysis must consider the class in isolation; therefore the hub smell is not present."
