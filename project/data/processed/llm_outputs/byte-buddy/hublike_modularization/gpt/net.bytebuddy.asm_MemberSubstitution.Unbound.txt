    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming=0 and outgoing=5 (not a large fan-out in isolation), so it is not a hub."
