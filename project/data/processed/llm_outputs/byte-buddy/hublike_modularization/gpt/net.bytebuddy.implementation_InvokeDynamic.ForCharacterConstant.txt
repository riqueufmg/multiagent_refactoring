    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: three distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has zero incoming dependencies and only three outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
