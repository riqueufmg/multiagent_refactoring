    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and has a small outgoing dependency set, so it does not match the smell."
