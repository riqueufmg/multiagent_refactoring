    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription. Although net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription itself references many types, those are not direct incoming dependencies of the analyzed class. Therefore, in isolation this class is not a hub."
