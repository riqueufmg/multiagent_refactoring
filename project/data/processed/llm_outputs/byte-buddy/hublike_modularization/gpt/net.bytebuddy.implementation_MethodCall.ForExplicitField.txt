    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription. Because it lacks incoming dependencies and has a very small number of outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
