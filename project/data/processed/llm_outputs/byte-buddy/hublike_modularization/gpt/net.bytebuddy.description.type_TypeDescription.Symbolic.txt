    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and 6 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationSource. Because there are no incoming dependencies (and only a moderate number of outgoing dependencies), the class does not qualify as a hub."
