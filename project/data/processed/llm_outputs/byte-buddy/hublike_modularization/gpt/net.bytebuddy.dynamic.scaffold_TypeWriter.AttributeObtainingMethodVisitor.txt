    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not meet that criterion. Note: while the outgoing target (OpenedClassReader) has its own dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of the analyzed class."
