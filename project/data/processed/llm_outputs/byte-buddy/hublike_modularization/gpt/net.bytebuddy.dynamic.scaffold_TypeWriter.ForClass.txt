    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter). Outgoing dependencies: 0. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class has only a single incoming dependency and no outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit the smell."
