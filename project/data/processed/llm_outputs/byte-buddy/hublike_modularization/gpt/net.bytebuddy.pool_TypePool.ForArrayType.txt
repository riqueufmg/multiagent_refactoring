Hub-like Modularization requires the class to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has neither multiple incoming nor multiple outgoing connections (incoming: [], outgoing: [net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin]). Although the target plugin lists many dependencies, they are not direct incoming links to the analyzed class."
