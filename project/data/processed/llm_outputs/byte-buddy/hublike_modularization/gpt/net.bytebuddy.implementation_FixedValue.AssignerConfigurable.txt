    "justification": "FixedValue.AssignerConfigurable has only one incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue) and only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner). A hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; here both counts are low. Note: Assigner itself has many dependencies, but those are dependencies of Assigner, not additional direct incoming/outgoing connections of FixedValue.AssignerConfigurable."
