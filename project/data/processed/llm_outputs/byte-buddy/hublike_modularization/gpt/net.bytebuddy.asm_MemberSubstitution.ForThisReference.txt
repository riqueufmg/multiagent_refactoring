    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (10): net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. However, it has only a single incoming dependency recorded: net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution. Because its in-degree is low (1) despite multiple outgoing links, it does not qualify as a hub-like module."
