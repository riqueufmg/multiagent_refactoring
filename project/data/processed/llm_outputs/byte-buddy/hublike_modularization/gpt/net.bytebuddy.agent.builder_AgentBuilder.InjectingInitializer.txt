    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.InjectingInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []). Its direct outgoing dependencies are limited to four abstractions: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator (outgoing degree = 4). Although those referenced classes themselves have many internal dependencies (ClassInjector: 27, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin: 16, TypeDescription: 57, ClassFileLocator: 19), the analyzed class does not exhibit both a large number of incoming and outgoing direct relationships required for Hub-like Modularization. Therefore, the smell is not detected."
