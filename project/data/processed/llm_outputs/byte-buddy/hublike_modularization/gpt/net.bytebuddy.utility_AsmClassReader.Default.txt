    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. AsmClassReader.Default has outgoing dependencies to four abstractions: net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, and net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin. Its incoming dependencies list contains only a single abstraction: net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader. The counts of incoming (1) and outgoing (4) dependencies are not large, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
