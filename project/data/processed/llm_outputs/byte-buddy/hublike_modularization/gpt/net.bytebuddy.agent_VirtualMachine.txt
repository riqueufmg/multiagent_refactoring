    "justification": "VirtualMachine has a large number of outgoing dependencies (12): ForJnaSolarisDoor, WindowsLibrary, Factory, PosixOwnerProvider, SolarisLibrary, Dispatcher, ForJnaWindowsNamedPipe, WindowsAttachLibrary, ForJnaPosixSocket, Connection, PosixLibrary, MacLibrary. It also has multiple incoming dependencies (3): ByteBuddyAgent, ByteBuddyAgent.AttachmentProvider, ByteBuddyAgent.ForEmulatedAttachment. The presence of many incoming and many outgoing links (15 distinct relationships in total) identifies VirtualMachine as a hub-like abstraction."
