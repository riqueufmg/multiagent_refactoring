    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StringMatcher has a small number of outgoing dependencies (3): net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.StringMatcher.Mode, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher. It has only one incoming dependency entry: net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers (i.e., a single class depends on StringMatcher). Although ElementMatchers itself depends on many types, StringMatcher itself does not show many distinct incoming or outgoing relationships in the provided data. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
