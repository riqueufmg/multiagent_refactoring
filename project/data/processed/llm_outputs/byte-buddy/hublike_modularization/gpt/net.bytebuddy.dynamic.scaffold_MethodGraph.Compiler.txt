    "justification": "The class has a limited set of outgoing dependencies (6 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility; net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph; net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription; net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher; net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin; net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and only a single incoming dependency recorded (referenced by net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies across a large number of other abstractions; this class does not exhibit that pattern based on the provided data."
