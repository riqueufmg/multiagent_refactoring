    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Multiplication",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Multiplication has a small number of direct relations: outgoing dependencies = 2 (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize) and incoming dependencies = 2 (net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod, net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.Appender). Because both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are low, it does not meet the criterion for Hub-like Modularization. Note: although one outgoing dependency (Implementation) itself lists many dependencies, the analysis considers the Multiplication class in isolation and counts its direct incoming/outgoing relationships."
