    "justification": "ModifierReviewable has a high number of outgoing dependencies (16 distinct modifier-related abstractions: MethodStrictness, MethodManifestation, Openness, Visibility, SyntheticState, ParameterManifestation, RequiredPhase, Mandate, EnumerationState, FieldPersistence, Ownership, Transitivity, SynchronizationState, TypeManifestation, FieldManifestation, ProvisioningState) and is referenced by many incoming abstractions across multiple packages (examples include ElementMatchers, TypeDefinition, TypeDescription, TypeDescription.Generic, TypeDescription.AbstractBase, TypeVariableSource, ByteCodeElement, FieldDescription, ModuleDescription, MethodDescription, ParameterDescription). The presence of numerous incoming references combined with numerous outgoing dependencies satisfies the definition of Hub-like Modularization (an abstraction with both incoming and outgoing ties to a large number of other abstractions)."
