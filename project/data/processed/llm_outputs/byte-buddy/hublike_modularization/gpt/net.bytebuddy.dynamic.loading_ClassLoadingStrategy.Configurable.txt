    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoaderDecorator) and only 1 incoming dependent (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Although the incoming dependent (ClassLoadingStrategy) itself references many classes, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of distinct incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not hub-like."
