    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForAnnotationValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue. Although those target classes list many of their own dependencies, the smell requires the analyzed abstraction itself to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships. Given zero incoming dependencies and only three direct outgoing dependencies, this class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
