    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Asynchronous has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing ties to other abstractions; this class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies."
