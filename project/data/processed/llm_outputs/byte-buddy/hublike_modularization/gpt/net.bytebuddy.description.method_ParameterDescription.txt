    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ParameterDescription exhibits hub-like modularization: it has outgoing dependencies to a large set of distinct abstractions (17 distinct outgoing dependencies, e.g. MethodDescription, ParameterDescription.Token, ParameterList, TypeDescription, AnnotationList, ByteCodeElement, JavaDispatcher, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, CachedReturnPlugin, AccessControllerPlugin, ModifierReviewable) and it is depended upon by a very large number of other abstractions (144 distinct incoming dependencies). Incoming references come from many packages and core components (examples include net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType and many of its nested types, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter and its subcomponents, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice and many nested Advice classes, net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall and its helpers, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool and its lazy variants, numerous ParameterList and MethodDescription variants, and many other classes across net.bytebuddy.dynamic, net.bytebuddy.asm, net.bytebuddy.implementation, net.bytebuddy.pool). The combination of many incoming collaborators (dozens) and many outgoing collaborators across multiple modules indicates the class functions as a central hub and hence shows the Hub-like Modularization smell."
