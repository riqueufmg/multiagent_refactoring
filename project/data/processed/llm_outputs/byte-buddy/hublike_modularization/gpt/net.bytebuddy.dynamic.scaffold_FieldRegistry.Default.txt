    "justification": "Not detected as Hub-like Modularization because the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although this class has outgoing dependencies to multiple abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldRegistry, net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription), the lack of incoming dependencies prevents it from being a hub."
