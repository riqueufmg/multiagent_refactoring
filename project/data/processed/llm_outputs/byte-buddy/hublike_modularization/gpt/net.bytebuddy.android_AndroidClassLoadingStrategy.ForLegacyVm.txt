    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number of either, so the smell is not detected."
