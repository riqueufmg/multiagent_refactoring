    "detection": true,
    "justification": "RecordComponentRegistry has both a substantial number of incoming and outgoing ties to many distinct abstractions, indicating hub-like modularization. Outgoing dependencies (8) include: TypeWriter, LatentMatcher, RecordComponentAttributeAppender, Transformer, RecordComponentRegistry.Compiled, ElementMatcher, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeDescription. Incoming dependencies (10) come from many core/different components, e.g. DynamicType, DynamicType.Builder, DynamicType.AbstractBase, DynamicType.Adapter, RecordComponentRegistry.Compiled, RecordComponentRegistry.Default, SubclassDynamicTypeBuilder, RebaseDynamicTypeBuilder, AbstractInliningDynamicTypeBuilder, and RedefinitionDynamicTypeBuilder. The class therefore mediates between multiple subsystems (dynamic types/builders, matchers, attribute appenders, type descriptions, and build plugins) and is depended on by many major builders/adapters, matching the definition of a hub with numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies."
