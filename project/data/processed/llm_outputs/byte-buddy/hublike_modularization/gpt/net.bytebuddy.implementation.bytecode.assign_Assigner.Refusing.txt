    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Given outgoing_count=2 and incoming_count=0, this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
