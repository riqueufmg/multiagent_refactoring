    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.ConstructorStrategy.WithMethodAttributeAppenderFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced classes themselves list many transitive dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies."
