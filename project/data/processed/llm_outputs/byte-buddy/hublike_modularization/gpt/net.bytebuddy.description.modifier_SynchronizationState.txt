    "justification": "SynchronizationState has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor) and only 2 incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable and net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase). Although those incoming classes reference many modifier types, SynchronizationState itself does not have a large number of distinct incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
