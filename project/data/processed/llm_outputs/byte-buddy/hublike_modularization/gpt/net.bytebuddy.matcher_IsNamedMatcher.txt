    "justification": "IsNamedMatcher has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.NamedElement, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing connections."
