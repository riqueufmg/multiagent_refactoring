    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Because there are no incoming dependencies and the number of outgoing dependencies is small, this does not meet the hub-like modularization criteria."
