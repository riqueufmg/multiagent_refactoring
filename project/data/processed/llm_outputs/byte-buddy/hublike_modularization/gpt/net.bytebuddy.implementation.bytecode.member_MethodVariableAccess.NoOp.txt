    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess. There are not a large number of incoming and outgoing connections, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
