    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because this class has no incoming dependencies, the smell is not detected despite its outgoing links."
