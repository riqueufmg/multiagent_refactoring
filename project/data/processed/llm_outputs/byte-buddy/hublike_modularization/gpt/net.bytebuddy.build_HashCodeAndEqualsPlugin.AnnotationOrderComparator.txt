    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). These counts are small and do not indicate a hub-like coupling."
