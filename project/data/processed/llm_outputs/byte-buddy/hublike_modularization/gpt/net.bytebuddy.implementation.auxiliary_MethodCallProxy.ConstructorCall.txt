    "justification": "ConstructorCall has a small set of direct outgoing dependencies (5): net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodReturn, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It has a single direct incoming dependency entry (1): net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.MethodCallProxy. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows only few direct incoming and outgoing connections, so this class is not a hub."
