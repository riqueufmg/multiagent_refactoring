    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Virtual",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the two referenced classes list many of their own dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing connections, so it is not a hub."
