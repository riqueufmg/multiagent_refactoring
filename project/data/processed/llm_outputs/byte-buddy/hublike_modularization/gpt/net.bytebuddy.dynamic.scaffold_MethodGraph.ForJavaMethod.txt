    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.ForJavaMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, and only one incoming dependency: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Although MethodDescription (an outgoing target) itself references many types, the ForJavaMethod class in isolation directly depends on a single other abstraction and is directly depended on by a single abstraction, so it does not meet the criteria for a hub."
