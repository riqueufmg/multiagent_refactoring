    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.MethodLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Analyzed in isolation, MethodCall.MethodLocator has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It has a single incoming dependency recorded: net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall (which references MethodCall.MethodLocator). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Here the incoming degree is 1 and the outgoing degree is 5, which does not constitute a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, so this class is not detected as a hub."
