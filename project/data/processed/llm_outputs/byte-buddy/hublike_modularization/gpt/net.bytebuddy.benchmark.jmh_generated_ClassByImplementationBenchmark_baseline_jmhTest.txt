    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_jmhType) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class has very few connections and therefore does not exhibit the smell."
