    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. In the provided data Plugin.Instantiator has a single outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin. Although the outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself depends on many types, those are not direct dependencies of Plugin.Instantiator. Because Plugin.Instantiator has only one incoming and one outgoing dependency, it does not meet the criteria for a hub."
