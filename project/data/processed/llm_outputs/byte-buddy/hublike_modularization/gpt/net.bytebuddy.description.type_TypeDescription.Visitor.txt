    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. TypeDescription.Visitor has outgoing dependencies to 8 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TargetType, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It has only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Because the incoming dependency count is very low and the outgoing count is moderate (8), this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
