    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: only one incoming abstraction references this class: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder -> MethodDelegationBinder.MethodBinding. Outgoing dependencies: four distinct targets are listed: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. Hub-like Modularization is characterized by a large number of both incoming and outgoing links; this class shows low fan-in (1) and a modest fan-out (4), so it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
