Outgoing dependency count = 2 (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides. TypePool.SelfContained has only one incoming and two outgoing direct dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like threshold. (Although the two outgoing classes themselves have many dependencies, the SelfContained class itself does not have many incoming/outgoing links.)"
