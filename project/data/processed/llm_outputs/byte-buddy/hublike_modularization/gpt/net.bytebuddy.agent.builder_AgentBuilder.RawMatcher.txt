Incoming dependencies include a single abstraction (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder) referencing this class. Because the class has only one incoming dependency and two outgoing dependencies (not a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships), it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization according to the provided data."
