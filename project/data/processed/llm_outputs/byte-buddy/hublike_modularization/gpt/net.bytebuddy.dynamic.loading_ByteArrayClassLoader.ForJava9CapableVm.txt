    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing links; this class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Note: although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin depends on many types, the analyzed class itself has only a single outgoing dependency and no incoming dependencies."
