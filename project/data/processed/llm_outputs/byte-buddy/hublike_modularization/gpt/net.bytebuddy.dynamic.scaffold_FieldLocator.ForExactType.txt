    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.ForExactType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator, and it has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Because incoming dependencies are zero and the number of outgoing dependencies is small (3), this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
