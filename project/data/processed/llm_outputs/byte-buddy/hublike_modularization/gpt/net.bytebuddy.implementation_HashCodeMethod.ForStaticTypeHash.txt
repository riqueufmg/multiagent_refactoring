    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; these counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
