    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. Note: the listed many dependencies belong to the HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself, not direct incoming/outgoing links of this class."
