Direct incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing direct dependencies; this class has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies and only a single incoming dependency, so it does not meet the criterion for a hub."
