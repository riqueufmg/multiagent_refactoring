    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no classes depend on this class). Outgoing direct dependencies: 4 (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Although these outgoing dependencies themselves reference many other abstractions, the analyzed class lacks incoming coupling. Hub-like Modularization requires substantial both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies means this class does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
