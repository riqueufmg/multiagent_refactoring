    "justification": "ByteBuddyJarsTaskExtension has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (to net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyJarsTask). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The only outgoing dependency is net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyJarsTask; although that target depends on net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin and org.gradle.api.tasks.PathSensitivity, these are indirect and do not increase ByteBuddyJarsTaskExtension's own incoming/outgoing degree. Therefore there is no hub-like modularization smell."
