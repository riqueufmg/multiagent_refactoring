    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although MemberSubstitution.Simple has many outgoing dependencies (11 distinct abstractions including Assigner, AnnotationDescription, TypeDefinition, StackManipulation, JavaConstant, FieldDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeList, TypeDescription, MethodDescription, ConstantValue), it has zero incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies (acting as a central hub). Because incoming dependencies are absent, the hub-like smell is not present for this class."
