    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; the absence of incoming dependencies (and only three outgoing) prevents this class from being a hub. Note: the outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, but that does not make this class a hub."
