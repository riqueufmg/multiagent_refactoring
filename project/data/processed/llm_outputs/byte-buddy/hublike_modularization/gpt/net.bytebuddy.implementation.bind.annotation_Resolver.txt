    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Resolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Resolver class has a small number of direct dependencies: 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder) and 2 incoming dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.AmbiguityResolver). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions. Based on the provided data and considering the class in isolation, these counts are low, so Resolver does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
