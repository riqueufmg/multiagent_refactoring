    "justification": "Plugin.Compound has only outgoing dependencies to 2 other abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; here incoming count = 0 and outgoing count = 2, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
