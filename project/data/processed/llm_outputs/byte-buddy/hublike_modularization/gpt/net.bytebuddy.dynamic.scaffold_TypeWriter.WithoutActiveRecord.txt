    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have numerous incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not meet that criterion. Although one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) itself references many classes, when analyzed in isolation WithoutActiveRecord does not have the large number of incoming/outgoing ties required for a hub-like smell."
