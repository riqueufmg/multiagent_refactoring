    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeDescription.ForTypeVariable has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of the analyzed class, so the class is not a hub."
