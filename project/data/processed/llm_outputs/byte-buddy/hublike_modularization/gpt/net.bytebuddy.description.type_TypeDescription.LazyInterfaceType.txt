Outgoing dependencies: 2 (direct dependencies listed in analyzed_package are net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only two direct outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the criterion."
