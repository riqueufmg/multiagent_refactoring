    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has outgoing dependencies to only 3 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
