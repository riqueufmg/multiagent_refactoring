    "justification": "ModuleToken has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription) and a single incoming dependency source (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; ModuleToken does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships based on the provided data."
