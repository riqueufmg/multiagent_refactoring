    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Verifier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Verifier has only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationSource, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner) and only 1 incoming depender (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. Although MethodDescription (one outgoing dependency) itself lists many further dependencies, those are indirect; Verifier does not show a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
