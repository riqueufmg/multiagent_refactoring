    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided counts are low, so the smell is not present."
