    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. It has a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). Because the incoming dependency count is very small (1) and the outgoing set is moderate (6), it does not exhibit the required many-to-many connectivity on both incoming and outgoing sides to be considered a hub. Therefore detection = false."
