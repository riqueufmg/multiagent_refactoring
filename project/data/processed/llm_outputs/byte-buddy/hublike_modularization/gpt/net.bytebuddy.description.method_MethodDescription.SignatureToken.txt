    "justification": "Direct incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription references SignatureToken). Direct outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin). Although the outgoing targets themselves list many dependent types, SignatureToken itself has only a single incoming and two outgoing direct relationships in the provided data, so it does not exhibit high numbers of both incoming and outgoing couplings required for a Hub-like Modularization smell."
