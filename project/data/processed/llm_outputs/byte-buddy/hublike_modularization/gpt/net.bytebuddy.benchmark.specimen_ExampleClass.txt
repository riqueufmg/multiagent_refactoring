    "justification": "ExampleClass has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (net.bytebuddy.benchmark.ClassByExtensionBenchmark and net.bytebuddy.benchmark.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark). Although ClassByExtensionBenchmark itself depends on many other types, ExampleClass does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
