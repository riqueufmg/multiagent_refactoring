    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule.Resolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one recorded outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and only one recorded incoming depender (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Here incoming count = 1 (JavaModule) and outgoing count = 1 (JavaDispatcher). Although JavaDispatcher itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of JavaModule.Resolver per the provided data and the analysis must consider the class in isolation; therefore it does not qualify as a hub."
