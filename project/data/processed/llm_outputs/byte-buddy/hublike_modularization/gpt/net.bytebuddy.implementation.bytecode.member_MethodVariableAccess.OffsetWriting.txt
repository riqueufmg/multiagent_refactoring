    "justification": "Not detected: Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. This class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation. The absence of incoming links and the small number of outgoing links mean it does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
