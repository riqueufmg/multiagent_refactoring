    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming_dependencies is empty and outgoing count is small (2). Although the outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, those are not incoming/outgoing relations of the analyzed class and do not make it a hub."
