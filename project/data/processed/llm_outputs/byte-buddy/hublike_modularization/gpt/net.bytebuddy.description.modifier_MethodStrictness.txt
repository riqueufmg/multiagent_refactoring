    "justification": "MethodStrictness has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor) and only two incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable and net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase). Although those incoming classes reference many other modifier classes, MethodStrictness itself does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships and therefore does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
