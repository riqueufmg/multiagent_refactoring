    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender) and only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; those conditions are not met here. (Note: the outgoing target MethodAttributeAppender itself lists many dependencies, but the analyzed class has a single outgoing edge to it.)"
