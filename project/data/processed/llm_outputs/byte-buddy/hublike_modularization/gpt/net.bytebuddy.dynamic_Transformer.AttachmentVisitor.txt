    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has outgoing dependencies to three abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and has zero incoming dependencies. The incoming degree is 0 and the outgoing degree (3) is not a large number; therefore it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
