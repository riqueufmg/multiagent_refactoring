    "justification": "RecordComponentList has outgoing dependencies to multiple distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It is also referenced (incoming dependencies) by a large number of other abstractions (20 distinct classes in the provided data) across packages such as net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold (TypeWriter and variants, InstrumentedType), net.bytebuddy.pool (TypePool and variants), and many net.bytebuddy.description.type.* classes (TypeDescription and its variants, TypeDefinition, RecordComponentList.Empty). The combination of many incoming references from core components and multiple outgoing dependencies to core type/collection/descriptor abstractions indicates RecordComponentList functions as a hub-like abstraction."
