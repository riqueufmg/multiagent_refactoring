{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.CodePreservingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodRebaseResolver) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Given the low outgoing count and no incoming dependencies in the provided data, the smell is not detected. Note: although one outgoing dependency (Implementation) itself references many types, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of the analyzed class and thus do not make it a hub in isolation."
