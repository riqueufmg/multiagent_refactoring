    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has only one outgoing dependency: [net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList], and zero incoming dependencies. Because incoming_dependencies = 0 and outgoing_dependencies count = 1 (not a large number), this does not meet the hub-like modularization condition."
