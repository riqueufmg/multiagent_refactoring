    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner) and only one incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor). A hub-like module would have many incoming and outgoing relationships with numerous other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing connection counts are low, so it does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
