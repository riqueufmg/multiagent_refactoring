    "justification": "TypeDescription.NoOp has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions. While the referenced AnnotationList and TypeDescription themselves reference many types, the NoOp class directly connects to only these two abstractions, so it is not a hub."
