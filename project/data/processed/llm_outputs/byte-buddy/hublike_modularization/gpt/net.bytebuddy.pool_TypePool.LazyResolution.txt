    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two outgoing direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion when considered in isolation."
