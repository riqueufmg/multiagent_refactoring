    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ConstructorResolver.ForInstrumentedType has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although TypeDescription (the single outgoing dependency) itself references many types, the analyzed class does not directly have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
