    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.GenericTypeExtractor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows no such many-to-many connectivity. (Note: HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many dependencies, but GenericTypeExtractor's direct outgoing set contains only that single abstraction.)"
