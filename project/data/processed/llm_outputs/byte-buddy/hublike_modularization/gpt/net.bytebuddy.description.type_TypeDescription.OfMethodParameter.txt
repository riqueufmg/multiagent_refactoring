    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.OfMethodParameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin). Although one outgoing dependency (TypeDescription) itself lists many dependencies, the analysis must consider the class in isolation and not assume transitive/inferred incoming ties. Given zero incoming links and only two direct outgoing links, this class does not meet the 'large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies' criterion for a hub-like module."
