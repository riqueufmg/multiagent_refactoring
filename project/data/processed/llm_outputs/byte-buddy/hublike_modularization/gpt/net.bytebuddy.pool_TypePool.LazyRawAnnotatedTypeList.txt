    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (no other abstractions depend on it) and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList and net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Although net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool itself references many types, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies required for a hub-like smell."
