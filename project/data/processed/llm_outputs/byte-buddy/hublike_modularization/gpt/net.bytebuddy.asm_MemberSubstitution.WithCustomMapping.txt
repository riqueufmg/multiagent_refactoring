    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a relatively large number of outgoing dependencies (13 distinct abstractions: ConstantValue, TypeDefinition, MethodGraph, EnumerationDescription, MethodDescription, ParameterDescription, JavaConstant, FieldDescription, JavaType, TypeList, TypeDescription, AnnotationValue, etc.), it has zero incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections. The absence of any incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []) means this class does not act as a hub in the dependency graph, so the smell is not detected."
