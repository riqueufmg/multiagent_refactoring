    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: none (empty). Incoming dependencies: a single incoming class (net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent). Although ByteBuddyAgent lists many dependencies, ByteBuddyAgent.Simple itself has zero outgoing and only one incoming dependency, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (which requires many incoming and many outgoing links)."
