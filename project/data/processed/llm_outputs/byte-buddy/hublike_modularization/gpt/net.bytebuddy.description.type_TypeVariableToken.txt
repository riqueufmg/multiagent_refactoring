    "justification": "TypeVariableToken has outgoing dependencies to multiple core abstractions (6): net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It is referenced by a large number of other abstractions (13 distinct incoming classes) across several packages, including net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType (and its Builder, AbstractBase, Adapter, TypeVariableDefinitionAdapter, MethodDefinitionAdapter, TypeVariableAnnotationAdapter), net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType, and multiple type-list classes in net.bytebuddy.description.type (TypeList, TypeList.Generic, TypeList.OfTypeVariables, TypeList.ForDetachedTypes, TypeList.AttachedTypeVariable). The combination of multiple outgoing links to core types and many incoming links from diverse parts of the codebase indicates a hub-like position in the dependency graph."
