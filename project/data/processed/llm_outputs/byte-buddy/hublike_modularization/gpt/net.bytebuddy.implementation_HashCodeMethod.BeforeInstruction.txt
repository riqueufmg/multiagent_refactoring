    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.BeforeInstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class lacks incoming relationships and has a small fan-out, so the smell is not present."
