    "justification": "BooleanMatcher has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; here the counts are low, so BooleanMatcher is not a hub. (While HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many dependencies, those are indirect and BooleanMatcher directly depends on that single abstraction.)"
