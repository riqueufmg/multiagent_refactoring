    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.Duplex",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Binder.Duplex has only three direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and it has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced types (e.g., TypeDescription) themselves depend on many classes, Duplex itself does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing links in the provided data, so it is not a hub."
