    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate.ImplicitlyTypedUnboxingResponsible",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections. Given the provided data (0 incoming, 3 outgoing) and the constraint to consider the class in isolation, it does not meet the hub-like criteria. (Although the outgoing targets expose many transitive dependencies, the class itself lacks the required high incoming connectivity.)"
