    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstructorComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ConstructorComparator has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has only two incoming dependents: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList and net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList.ForLoadedMethods (both list ConstructorComparator in their dependencies). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here outgoing = 0 and incoming = 2 (small), so the class does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
