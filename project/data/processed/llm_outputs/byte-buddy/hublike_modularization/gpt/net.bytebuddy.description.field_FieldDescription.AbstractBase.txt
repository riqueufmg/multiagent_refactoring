    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no classes depend on this abstraction). Outgoing dependencies: 4 (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only a small number of outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not present."
