    "justification": "The class has only three outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and has a small number of outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
