    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (23 distinct referenced abstractions, e.g. net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, ModuleLayer, CreationAction, ModuleDescriptor, SimpleModuleFinder, ModuleFinder, ClassLoaderDecorator, DynamicType, TypeDescription) but has 0 incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both high incoming and high outgoing coupling. Because the incoming dependency count is zero, this class does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
