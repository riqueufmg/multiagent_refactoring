    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 6 direct outgoing dependencies (RecordComponentDescription, MethodDescription, StackSize, FieldDescription, TypeList, TypeDescription). Although some of those outgoing targets (notably TypeDescription) themselves depend on many other abstractions, the analyzed class does not exhibit both high incoming and high outgoing coupling required for Hub-like Modularization."
