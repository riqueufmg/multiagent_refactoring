    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Minimal has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Given the provided data (outgoing dependencies = 2, incoming dependencies = 0) and the requirement to consider the class in isolation, this class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
