    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.build.EntryPoint. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition."
