    "justification": "The class has only one listed outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and a single incoming dependency entry (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription). There is no evidence of the class having incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of distinct abstractions. The JavaDispatcher entry lists many of its own dependencies, but those are indirect and do not indicate that ParameterDescription.Parameter directly depends on a large set of different abstractions."
