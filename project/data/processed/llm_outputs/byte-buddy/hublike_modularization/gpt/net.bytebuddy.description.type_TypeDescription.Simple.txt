Incoming dependency set is also small: only 1 incoming abstraction (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) lists TypeDescription.Simple among its dependencies. Because the class has only a single incoming abstraction and a single outgoing abstraction in the provided data, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization (no large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
