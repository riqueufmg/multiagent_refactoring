    "justification": "TransformedField has 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class lacks incoming dependencies and therefore is not a hub. (Note: one outgoing target, TypeDescription, is highly connected, but that does not make TransformedField a hub in isolation.)"
