    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows only a single outgoing link and no incoming links. Although the outgoing target (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) has many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit hub-like coupling."
