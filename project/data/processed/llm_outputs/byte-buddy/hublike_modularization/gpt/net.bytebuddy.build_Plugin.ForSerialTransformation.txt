    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForSerialTransformation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections. Although the incoming class (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin) references many types, net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForSerialTransformation itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
