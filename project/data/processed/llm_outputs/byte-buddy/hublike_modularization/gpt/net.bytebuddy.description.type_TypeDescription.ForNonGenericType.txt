    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no incoming dependencies). Outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both numerous incoming and outgoing relationships. This class has no incoming links and only two direct outgoing dependencies (the large dependency list shown belongs to the referenced TypeDescription class, i.e., transitive dependencies), so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
