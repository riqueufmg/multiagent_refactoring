    "justification": "AsmClassReader.JdkClassReader has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and only one incoming dependent (net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader). While the referenced JavaDispatcher entry lists many of its own dependencies, the target class itself is directly coupled to just one incoming and one outgoing abstraction, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
