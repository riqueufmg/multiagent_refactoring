    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType) and one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only a single incoming and a single outgoing relation, so the smell is not present."
