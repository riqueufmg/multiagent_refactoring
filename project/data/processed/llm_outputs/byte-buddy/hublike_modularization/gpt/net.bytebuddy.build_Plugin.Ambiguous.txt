    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Ambiguous",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. Although the outgoing target (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) has many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Ambiguous, so it does not meet the hub criteria."
