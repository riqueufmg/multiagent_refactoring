    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ParameterDescription.OfMethod has only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (MethodDescription, TypeDescription, AnnotationList) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions. Although MethodDescription and TypeDescription (two of its dependencies) themselves depend on many other types, ParameterDescription.OfMethod itself is only directly connected to three abstractions and thus does not qualify as a hub."
