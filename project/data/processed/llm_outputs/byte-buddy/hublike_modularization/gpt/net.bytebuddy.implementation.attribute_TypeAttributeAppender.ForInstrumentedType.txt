    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no incoming references). Outgoing dependencies: 4 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. This class has no incoming dependencies and only four direct outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like criterion. (While some of its outgoing targets themselves reference many types, the smell is evaluated for this class in isolation based on its own incoming/outgoing counts.)"
