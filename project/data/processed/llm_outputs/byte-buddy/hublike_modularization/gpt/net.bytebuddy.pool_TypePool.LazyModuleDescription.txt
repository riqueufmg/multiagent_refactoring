    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Although ModuleDescription (the single outgoing target) itself has many dependencies, LazyModuleDescription does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing relationships."
