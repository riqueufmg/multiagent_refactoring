    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: only four distinct abstractions listed (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.ClassWriterStrategy, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool), which is not a large number. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming edges and a small outgoing degree, so the smell is not detected. Note: some of the outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, but the detection is based on the analyzed class in isolation."
