    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many of its own dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links for the analyzed class, so the conditions for the hub smell are not met."
