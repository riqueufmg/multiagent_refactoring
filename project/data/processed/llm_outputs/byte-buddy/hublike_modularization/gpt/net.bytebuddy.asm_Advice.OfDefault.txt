    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OfDefault",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Here the direct coupling is minimal (one outgoing, no incoming); although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many of its own dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of Advice.OfDefault per the provided data, so the hub smell is not present."
