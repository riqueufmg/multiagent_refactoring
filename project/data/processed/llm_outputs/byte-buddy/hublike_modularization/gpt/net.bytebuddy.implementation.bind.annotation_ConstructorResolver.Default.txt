    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Here the connectivity is limited (0 incoming, 2 outgoing), so it does not meet the hub-like criterion. Note: although the two referenced classes themselves have many internal dependencies, the analysis is constrained to the class in isolation and counts only its direct incoming/outgoing relations."
