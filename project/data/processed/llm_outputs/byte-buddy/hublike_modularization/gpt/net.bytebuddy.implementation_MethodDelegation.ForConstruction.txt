    "justification": "Not detected: Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies and 5 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication). The absence of incoming dependencies and only a modest number of outgoing dependencies means it does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
