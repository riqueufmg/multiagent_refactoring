    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Pausing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Pausing has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The fact that the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin has many internal dependencies does not make AgentBuilder.Pausing a hub because those are not direct incoming/outgoing dependencies of the analyzed class."
