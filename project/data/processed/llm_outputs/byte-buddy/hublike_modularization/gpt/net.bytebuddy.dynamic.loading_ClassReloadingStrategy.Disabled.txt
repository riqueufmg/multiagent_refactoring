    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy.Disabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency entry (incoming from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy). Although that incoming class lists multiple dependencies (including Disabled), the analyzed class itself is referenced by only one other abstraction and does not depend on others, so it does not meet the 'hub-like' criterion."
