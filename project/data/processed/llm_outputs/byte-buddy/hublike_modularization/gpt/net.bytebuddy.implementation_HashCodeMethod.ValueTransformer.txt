    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.ValueTransformer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; ValueTransformer does not have a large number of dependencies with other abstractions. Although the incoming class (HashCodeMethod) itself depends on many classes, ValueTransformer in isolation has only a single incoming link and no outgoing links, so it is not a hub."
