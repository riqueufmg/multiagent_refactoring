    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; although the referenced TypeList has many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
