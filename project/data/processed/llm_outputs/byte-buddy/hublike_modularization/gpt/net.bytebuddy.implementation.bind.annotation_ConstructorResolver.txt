    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ConstructorResolver has 0 incoming dependencies and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion (incoming=0, outgoing=2). Although the two referenced classes themselves list many sub-dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of ConstructorResolver in the provided data."
