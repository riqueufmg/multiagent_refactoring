    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []) and only 2 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription. Because it lacks incoming dependencies and does not depend on a large number of other abstractions, it does not qualify as a hub."
