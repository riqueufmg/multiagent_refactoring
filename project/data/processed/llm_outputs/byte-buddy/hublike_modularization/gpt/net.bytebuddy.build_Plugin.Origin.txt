    "justification": "Plugin.Origin has only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator. It has a single incoming depender shown (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here there is only one incoming class and a small number (3) of outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
