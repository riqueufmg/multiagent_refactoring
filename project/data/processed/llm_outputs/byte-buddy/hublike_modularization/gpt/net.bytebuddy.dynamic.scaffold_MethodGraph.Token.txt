    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced MethodDescription type itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing relations of net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Token per the provided data. Therefore the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
