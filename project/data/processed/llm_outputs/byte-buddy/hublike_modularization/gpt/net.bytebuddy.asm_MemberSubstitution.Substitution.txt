    "justification": "The class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (23 distinct target abstractions such as net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, etc.), but only a single incoming dependency entry (referenced by net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here incoming fan-in is low (1), so the class is not a hub."
