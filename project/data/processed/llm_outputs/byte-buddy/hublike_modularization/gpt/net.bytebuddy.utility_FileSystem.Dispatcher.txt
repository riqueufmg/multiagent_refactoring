    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and is referenced by 1 incoming class (net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although the outgoing target (JavaDispatcher) itself lists many dependencies, the analyzed class directly connects to only a single outgoing and a single incoming abstraction, so it does not qualify as a hub in the provided data."
