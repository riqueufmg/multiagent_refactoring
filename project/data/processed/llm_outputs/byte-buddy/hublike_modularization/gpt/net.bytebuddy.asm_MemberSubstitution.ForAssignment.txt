    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and a small set of outgoing dependencies (6 distinct targets: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not the case here."
