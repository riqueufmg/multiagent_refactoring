    "justification": "Not detected: ByteCodeElement.Token has no incoming dependencies and only two direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships; although TypeDescription itself lists many internal dependencies, ByteCodeElement.Token's direct dependency footprint is small and does not meet the hub-like criteria."
