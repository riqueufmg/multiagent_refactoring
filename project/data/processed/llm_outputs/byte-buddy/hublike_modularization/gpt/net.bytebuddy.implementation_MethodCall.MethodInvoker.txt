    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependency relationships. The analyzed class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency source (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). Because both incoming and outgoing degrees are small (incoming: 1, outgoing: 3), it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
