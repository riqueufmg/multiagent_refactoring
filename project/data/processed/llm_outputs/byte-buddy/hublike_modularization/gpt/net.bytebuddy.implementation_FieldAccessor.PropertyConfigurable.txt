    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no classes depend on this abstraction). Direct outgoing dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Although the referenced TypeDescription type itself lists many (57) dependencies, the analyzed class has only a single direct outgoing dependency and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not meet that criterion."
