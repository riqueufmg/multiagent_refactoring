    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the low counts here (1 incoming, 1 outgoing) do not meet that criterion. The additional types listed under the outgoing dependency are transitive dependencies of HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, not direct dependencies of StackManipulation.Size."
