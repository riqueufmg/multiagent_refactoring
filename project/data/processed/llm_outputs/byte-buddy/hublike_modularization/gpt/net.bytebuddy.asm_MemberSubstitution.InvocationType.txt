    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here the in-degree is 1 and out-degree is 0, so it does not exhibit hub-like connectivity."
