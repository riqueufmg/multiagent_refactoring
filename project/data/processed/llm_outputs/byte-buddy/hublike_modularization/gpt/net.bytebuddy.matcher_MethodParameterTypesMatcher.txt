    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not meet that criterion."
