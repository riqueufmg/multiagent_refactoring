    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.StreamWriting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin has many of its own dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships."
