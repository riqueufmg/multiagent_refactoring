    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 6 direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although some of the outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, MethodOverrideMatcher has no incoming couplings and only a moderate number (6) of outgoing couplings, so it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
