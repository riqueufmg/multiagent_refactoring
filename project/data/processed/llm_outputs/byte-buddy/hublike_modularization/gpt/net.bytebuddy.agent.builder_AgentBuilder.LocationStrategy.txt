    "justification": "AgentBuilder.LocationStrategy has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) and a single incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The observed incoming degree = 1 and outgoing degree = 2 — insufficient to qualify as a hub. (Per analysis constraint: class considered in isolation.)"
