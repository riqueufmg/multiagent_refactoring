    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: two direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Although those two target classes themselves reference many other abstractions, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies required for Hub-like Modularization (no incoming edges and only two outgoing edges). Therefore the hub-like modularization smell is not detected."
