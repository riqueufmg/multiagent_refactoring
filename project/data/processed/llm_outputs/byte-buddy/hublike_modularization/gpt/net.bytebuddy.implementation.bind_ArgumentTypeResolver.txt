    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.ArgumentTypeResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ArgumentTypeResolver has 5 outgoing direct dependencies (MethodDescription, ParameterList, TypeDescription, MethodDelegationBinder, ArgumentTypeResolver.ParameterIndexToken) and 3 incoming dependents (bind.annotation.BindingMechanic, MethodDelegationBinder, MethodDelegationBinder.AmbiguityResolver). While it is mutually coupled with MethodDelegationBinder and references central descriptor types, the direct fan-in (3) and fan-out (5) are modest and do not constitute dependencies with a large number of other abstractions required for a hub-like modularization smell. The presence of many transitive dependencies in the referenced types does not change that ArgumentTypeResolver itself directly interacts with a limited set of classes."
