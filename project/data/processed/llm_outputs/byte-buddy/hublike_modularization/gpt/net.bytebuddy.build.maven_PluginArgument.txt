{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.PluginArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin) and no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced Plugin type lists many of its own dependencies, PluginArgument itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing links, so the smell is not detected."
