    "justification": "DeclaringMethodMatcher has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; the provided data shows neither a large incoming nor a large outgoing degree."
