Outgoing dependency count = 2 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has a low direct fan-in (1) and fan-out (2), so the smell is not detected."
