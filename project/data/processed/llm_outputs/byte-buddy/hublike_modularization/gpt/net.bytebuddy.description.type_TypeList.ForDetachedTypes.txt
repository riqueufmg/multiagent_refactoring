    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeVariableToken, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. Although one outgoing dependency (TypeDescription) is itself highly connected, the analyzed class lacks high fan-in and only a small fan-out, so it does not qualify as a hub."
