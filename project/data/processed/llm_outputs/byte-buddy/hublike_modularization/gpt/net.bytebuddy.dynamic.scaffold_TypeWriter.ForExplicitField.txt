    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForExplicitField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the class to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 4 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter. It has 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies (and only a modest number of outgoing dependencies), the class does not meet the hub-like criterion. Note: some outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, but that does not create incoming dependencies to this class and thus does not make it a hub in isolation."
