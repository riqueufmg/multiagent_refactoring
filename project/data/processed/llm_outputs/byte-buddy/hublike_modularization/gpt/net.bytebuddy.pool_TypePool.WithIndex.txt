    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are empty (no outgoing edges). Incoming dependencies show only one referring class (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) that happens to list many types including TypePool.WithIndex, but there is only a single incoming abstraction. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming AND outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions; this class has neither multiple incoming sources nor any outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
