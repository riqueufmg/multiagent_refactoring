    "justification": "Not detected as Hub-like Modularization: the class has only outgoing dependencies to four abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class shows low connectivity and no incoming links."
