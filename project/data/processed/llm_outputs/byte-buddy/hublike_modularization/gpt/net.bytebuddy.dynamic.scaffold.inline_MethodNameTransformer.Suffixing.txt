    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although the outgoing target (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself depends on many types, the analyzed class does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing relationships (incoming=0, outgoing=1), so the hub smell is not present."
