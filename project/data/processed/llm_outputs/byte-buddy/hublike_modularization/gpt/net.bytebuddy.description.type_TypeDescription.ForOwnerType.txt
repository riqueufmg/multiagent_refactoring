    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the counts are minimal (incoming: 0, outgoing: 1), so it does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
