    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Advice.StackMapFrameHandler has a small number of outgoing dependencies (4: net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion) and only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships; here both counts are low, so the smell is not present."
