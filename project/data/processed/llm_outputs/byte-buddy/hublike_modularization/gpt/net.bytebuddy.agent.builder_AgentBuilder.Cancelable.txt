    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Cancelable has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and only one incoming dependency recorded: net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder. While HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself depends on many types, AgentBuilder.Cancelable does not directly have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions and therefore does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
