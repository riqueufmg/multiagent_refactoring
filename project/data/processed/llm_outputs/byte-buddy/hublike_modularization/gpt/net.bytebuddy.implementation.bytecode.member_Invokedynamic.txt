    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and 5 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.JavaConstantValue). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here incoming dependencies = 0, so Invokedynamic does not qualify as a hub despite some outgoing targets having many internal dependencies."
