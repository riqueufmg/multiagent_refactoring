    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 9 distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) — a moderate number. Incoming dependencies: only 1 abstraction (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution) references this class. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires that the abstraction have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Because this class has many outgoing but very few incoming dependencies (only one), it does not meet the definition of a hub."
