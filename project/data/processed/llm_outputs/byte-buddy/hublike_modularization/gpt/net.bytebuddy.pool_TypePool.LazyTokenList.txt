    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyTokenList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only three outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low counts (3 outgoing, 1 incoming), so this class does not qualify as a hub."
