    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 7 direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Incoming dependencies: a single incoming reference from net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution. Although the incoming class (MemberSubstitution) itself references many other abstractions, ForDynamicInvocation has only one incoming dependency and a moderate number of outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell (which requires many incoming and many outgoing connections)."
