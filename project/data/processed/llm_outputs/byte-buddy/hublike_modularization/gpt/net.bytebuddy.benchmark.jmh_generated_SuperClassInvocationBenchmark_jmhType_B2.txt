    "justification": "Both outgoing and incoming dependency lists are empty (outgoing_dependencies: 0, incoming_dependencies: 0). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class has no incoming or outgoing dependencies and therefore does not exhibit the smell."
