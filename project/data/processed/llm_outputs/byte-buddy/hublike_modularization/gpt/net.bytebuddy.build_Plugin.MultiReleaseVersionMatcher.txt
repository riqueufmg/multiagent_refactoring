    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition in the provided data."
