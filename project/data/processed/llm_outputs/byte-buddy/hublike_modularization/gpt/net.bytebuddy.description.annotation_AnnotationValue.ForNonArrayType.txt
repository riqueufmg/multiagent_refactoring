    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. This class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue). Although that incoming class references many other types, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing connections, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
