    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.GraalImageCode) and only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.GraalImageCode). Both incoming and outgoing dependency sets are minimal and reference the same single abstraction, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization which requires a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies."
