    "justification": "The class has only a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder). While the referenced Implementation type lists many of its own dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of MethodDelegationBinder.Record in the provided data. The definition requires many incoming and outgoing connections; Record shows only one of each, so it is not a hub."
