    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.RecordComponentDefinitionAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.RecordComponentAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer, and net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and it has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because incoming dependencies are absent (0), the class does not meet the hub-like criteria. (Per constraint: analysis is limited to the provided data and does not treat transitive dependencies as making this class a hub.)"
