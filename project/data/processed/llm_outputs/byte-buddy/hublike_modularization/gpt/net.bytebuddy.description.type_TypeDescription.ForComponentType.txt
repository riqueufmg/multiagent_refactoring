    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForComponentType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections. Although the referenced JavaDispatcher has many of its own dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
