    "justification": "The class has only one explicit outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) and only one incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation). Although the Implementation class (an outgoing target) lists many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships required to be considered a hub."
