    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoaderDecorator, but has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and therefore does not meet the smell criteria."
