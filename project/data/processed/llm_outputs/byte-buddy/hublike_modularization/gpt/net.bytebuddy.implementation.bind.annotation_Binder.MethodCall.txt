    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.MethodCall",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Binder.MethodCall has multiple outgoing dependencies (Assigner, MethodDescription, MethodReturn, StackManipulation, MethodVariableAccess, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, ArrayAccess) indicating it depends on many other abstractions, but it has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because incoming dependencies are absent, this class does not meet the hub-like modularization smell."
