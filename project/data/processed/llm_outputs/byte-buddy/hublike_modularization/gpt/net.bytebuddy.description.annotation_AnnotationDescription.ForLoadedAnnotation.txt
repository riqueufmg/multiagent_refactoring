    "justification": "Not detected. The class has outgoing dependencies to six other abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.enumeration.EnumerationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and its outgoing dependency count is small, so it is not a hub."
