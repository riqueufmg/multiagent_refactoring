    "justification": "The class has only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList and net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Here incoming=0 and outgoing=2, which are not a large number. (While net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool itself lists many dependencies, those are dependencies of TypePool, not direct dependencies of TypePool.LazyUnboundWildcard per the provided data.)"
