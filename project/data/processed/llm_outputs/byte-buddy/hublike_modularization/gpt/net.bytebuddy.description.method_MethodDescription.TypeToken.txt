    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct relationships: 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
