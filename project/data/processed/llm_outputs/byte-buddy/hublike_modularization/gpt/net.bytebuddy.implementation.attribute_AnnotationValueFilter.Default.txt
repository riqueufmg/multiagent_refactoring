    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the provided data shows only a single outgoing dependency and no incoming dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
