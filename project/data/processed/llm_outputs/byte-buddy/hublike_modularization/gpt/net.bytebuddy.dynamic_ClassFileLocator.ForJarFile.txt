    "justification": "The class has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.utility.StreamDrainer) and zero incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not exhibit that (only 2 outgoing, 0 incoming)."
