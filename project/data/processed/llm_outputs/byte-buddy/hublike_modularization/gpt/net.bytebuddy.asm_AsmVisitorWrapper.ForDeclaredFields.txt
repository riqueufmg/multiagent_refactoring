    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.ForDeclaredFields",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 explicit outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) but 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Because incoming dependencies are absent (incoming_dependencies = []), this class does not meet the hub-like criterion."
