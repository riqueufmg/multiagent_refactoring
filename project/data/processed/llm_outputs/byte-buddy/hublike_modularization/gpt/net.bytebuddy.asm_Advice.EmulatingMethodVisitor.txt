    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) — Implementation itself depends on many types (≈30 listed), ByteCodeAppender and OpenedClassReader have several dependencies — but there are 0 incoming dependencies (no other abstractions depend on this class). The smell requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming dependency count = 0, outgoing dependency count = 3, so the criteria are not met."
