    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, and net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships, so the smell is not detected."
