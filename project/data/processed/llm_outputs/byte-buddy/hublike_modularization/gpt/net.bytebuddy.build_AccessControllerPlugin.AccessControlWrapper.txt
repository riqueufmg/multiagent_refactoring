    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 7 outgoing dependencies (OpenedClassReader, MethodDescription, JavaType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AsmVisitorWrapper, TypeDescription, Implementation) but 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies, it does not exhibit the bidirectional 'hub' property required for Hub-like Modularization."
