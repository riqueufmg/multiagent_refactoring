    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher (2 outgoing). Incoming dependencies: referenced by net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder (1 incoming). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction itself to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class has only 2 outgoing and 1 incoming dependency, so it is not a hub. (Note: one outgoing target, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, has many of its own dependencies, but that does not make ResubmissionOnErrorMatcher a hub.)"
