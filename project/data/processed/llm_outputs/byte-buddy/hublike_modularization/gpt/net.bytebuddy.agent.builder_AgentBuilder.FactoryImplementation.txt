Incoming dependencies: only 1 known abstraction depends on this class (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Because the class has a small number of incoming relationships (1) and a moderate number of outgoing relationships (5) in the provided data, it does not show the hallmark of a hub (many incoming and many outgoing links to a large number of other abstractions)."
