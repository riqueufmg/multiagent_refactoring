    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Split has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing coupling; this class does not exhibit that. (Note: AuxiliaryType itself lists multiple dependencies, but AgentBuilder.Split directly depends on only that single abstraction.)"
