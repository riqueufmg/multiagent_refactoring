    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, and net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming_dependencies is empty and outgoing count is small, so the smell is not present."
