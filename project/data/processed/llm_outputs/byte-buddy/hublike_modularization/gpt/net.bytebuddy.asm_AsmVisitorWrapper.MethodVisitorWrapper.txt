    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (incoming_dependencies is empty). Direct outgoing dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has neither many incoming nor many direct outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing dependency (Implementation) itself references many other types, those are not direct incoming/outgoing relations of this class per the provided data, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
