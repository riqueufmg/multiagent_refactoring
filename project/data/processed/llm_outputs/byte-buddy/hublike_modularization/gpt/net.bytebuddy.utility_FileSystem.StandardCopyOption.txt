    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, and only one incoming dependency: net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; these counts (1 incoming, 1 outgoing) are too small to qualify. (Although JavaDispatcher itself lists many dependencies, StandardCopyOption only depends on that single abstraction.)"
