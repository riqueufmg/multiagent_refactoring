    "justification": "AnnotationTargetMatcher has 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class has neither a large number of outgoing links nor any incoming links, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
