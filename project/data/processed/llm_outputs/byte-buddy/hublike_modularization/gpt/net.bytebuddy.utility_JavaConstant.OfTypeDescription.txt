Outgoing dependencies are only two abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has neither many incoming nor many outgoing dependencies."
