    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Therefore it does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern. (Although the outgoing target lists many dependencies, the analyzed class itself directly depends on a single abstraction.)"
