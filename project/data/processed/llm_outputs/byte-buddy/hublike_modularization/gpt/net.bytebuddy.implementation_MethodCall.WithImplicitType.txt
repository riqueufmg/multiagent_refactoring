Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class's incoming and outgoing dependency counts are low. (Note: the Implementation class itself lists many dependencies, but those are dependencies of Implementation, not of MethodCall.WithImplicitType.)"
