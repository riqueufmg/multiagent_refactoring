    "justification": "Incoming dependencies are empty (no incoming links). The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation), which is not a large number. Although those two targets list many dependencies themselves, hub-like modularization requires the analyzed abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not meet that criteria."
