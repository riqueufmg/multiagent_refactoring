    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and zero incoming dependencies. The smell requires the abstraction itself to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the analyzed class does not exhibit both high in-degree and high out-degree. (Note: the outgoing target lists many dependencies, but that does not make the analyzed class a hub.)"
