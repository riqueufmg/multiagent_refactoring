    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here the analyzed class references a single abstraction. Although net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of the analyzed class, so the class does not exhibit a hub-like coupling pattern."
