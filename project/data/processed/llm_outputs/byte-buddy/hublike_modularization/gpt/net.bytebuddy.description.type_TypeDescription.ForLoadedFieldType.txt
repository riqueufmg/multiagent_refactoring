    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although the outgoing dependency (CachedReturnPlugin) itself references many types, those are not direct incoming/outgoing dependencies of the analyzed class. Therefore the class does not exhibit a hub-like dependency profile."
