    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Delegation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph). Although those referenced classes themselves list many further dependencies, the analysis must consider the class in isolation and only direct incoming/outgoing links; it therefore does not exhibit hub-like modularization which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing direct dependencies."
