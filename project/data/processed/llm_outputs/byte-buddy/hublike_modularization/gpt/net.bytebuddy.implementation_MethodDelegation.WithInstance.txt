    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Its direct outgoing dependencies are limited to five abstractions: TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder, MethodGraph, FieldDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeDescription. Although those outgoing targets themselves list many internal dependencies, the analyzed class lacks incoming coupling and does not exhibit a large number of direct bi-directional connections, so it does not qualify as a hub."
