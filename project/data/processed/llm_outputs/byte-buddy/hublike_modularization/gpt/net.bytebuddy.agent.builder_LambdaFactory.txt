    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.LambdaFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LambdaFactory has outgoing dependencies to 4 distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) but has 0 incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. While the outgoing targets themselves depend on many other types, the analyzed class lacks incoming links, so it does not qualify as a hub."
