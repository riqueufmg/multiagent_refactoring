Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. This class has no incoming dependencies and only two direct outgoing dependencies. (Note: the two target classes have many dependencies themselves — HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin -> 16 deps; MethodDescription -> 24 deps — but those are not direct incoming links to this class and do not make this class a hub in isolation.)"
