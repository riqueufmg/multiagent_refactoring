    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no other abstractions depend on this class). Outgoing dependencies: 4 (depends on net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has only outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, so it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
