    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no classes depend on this class). Outgoing dependencies: 1 (depends only on net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has neither a large number of incoming nor outgoing dependencies. Note: although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself lists many dependencies, the analyzed class has a single outgoing link and no incoming links, so it does not qualify as a hub."
