    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to three abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, and net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, and a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. The total number of distinct dependency partners is 3, which is low and does not constitute the large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
