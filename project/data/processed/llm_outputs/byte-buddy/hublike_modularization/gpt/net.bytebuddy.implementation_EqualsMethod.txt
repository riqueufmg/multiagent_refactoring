    "justification": "EqualsMethod has a large number of outgoing dependencies (20 distinct other abstractions such as net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodReturn, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers, various EqualsMethod inner types, etc.) but only a single incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; here incoming relationships are minimal, so the class does not meet the hub-like modularization smell criteria."
