    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class lacks incoming relationships and has a small number of outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
