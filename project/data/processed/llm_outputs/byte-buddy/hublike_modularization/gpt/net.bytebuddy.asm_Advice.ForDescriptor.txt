    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForDescriptor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships with many other abstractions. Although the incoming class net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice references many types, Advice.ForDescriptor itself is referenced by only that single abstraction and has no outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
