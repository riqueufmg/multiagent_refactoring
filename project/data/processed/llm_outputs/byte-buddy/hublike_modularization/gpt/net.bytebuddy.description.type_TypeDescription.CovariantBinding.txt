    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; here the analyzed class does not directly depend on or is depended upon by a large number of other abstractions. (While the single outgoing dependency itself references many classes, those are not direct incoming/outgoing edges of the analyzed class.)"
