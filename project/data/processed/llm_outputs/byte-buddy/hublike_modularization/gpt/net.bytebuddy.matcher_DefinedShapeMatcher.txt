Outgoing dependencies: 3 direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections; this class has no incoming connections and only three direct outgoing connections, so it does not meet the hub-like criterion. Note: although the referenced outgoing classes themselves depend on many types, the smell is evaluated on this class's own incoming/outgoing relationships."
