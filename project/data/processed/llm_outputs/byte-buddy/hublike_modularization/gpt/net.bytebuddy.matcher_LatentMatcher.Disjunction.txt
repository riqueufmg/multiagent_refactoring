    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming connections and has a small number of outgoing connections, so the smell is not present."
