    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AdviceVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Advice.AdviceVisitor has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (5): net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It has a single incoming dependency in the provided data (from net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided incoming count (1) and outgoing count (5) do not indicate a large number of direct connections, so the smell is not detected."
