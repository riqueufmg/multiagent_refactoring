    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and only one incoming dependency source (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). Although the outgoing target HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself references many classes, those are not direct dependencies of ClassInjector.Initializable. Therefore the class does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies required to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
