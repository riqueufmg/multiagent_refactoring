    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy). Hub-like Modularization is characterized by an abstraction having dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. With a total of 3 direct relationships, this class does not exhibit hub-like coupling. Note: while the two outgoing target classes themselves reference many types, the analysis is limited to direct dependencies of the class in isolation, which remain few."
