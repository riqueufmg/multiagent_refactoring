    "justification": "ModifierAdjustment has many outgoing dependencies (e.g., ModifierAdjustment.ModifierAdjustingClassVisitor, OpenedClassReader, MethodDescription, ElementMatchers, FieldList, MethodList, TypePool, FieldDescription, ElementMatcher, ModifierContributor, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AsmVisitorWrapper, TypeDescription, Implementation), but the provided data lists zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because there are no incoming dependencies in the provided data, the hub-like smell is not detected."
