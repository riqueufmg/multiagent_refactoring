    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). Incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has only a single outgoing and a single incoming dependency, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization. Note: the referenced MethodDescription type itself lists many dependencies (24), but those are dependencies of MethodDescription, not additional direct incoming/outgoing edges for Advice.MethodSizeHandler."
