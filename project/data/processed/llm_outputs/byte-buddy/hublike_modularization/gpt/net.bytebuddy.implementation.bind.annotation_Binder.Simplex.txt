    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming_dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). Although those outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class lacks incoming coupling and therefore does not meet the hub-like criterion."
