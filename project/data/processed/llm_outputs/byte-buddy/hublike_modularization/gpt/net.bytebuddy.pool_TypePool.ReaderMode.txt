    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ReaderMode",

    "justification": "ReaderMode has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections. Here incoming count = 1 (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and outgoing count = 0, so ReaderMode is not a hub. (Note: TypePool itself lists many dependencies, but that makes TypePool a hub candidate, not ReaderMode.)"
