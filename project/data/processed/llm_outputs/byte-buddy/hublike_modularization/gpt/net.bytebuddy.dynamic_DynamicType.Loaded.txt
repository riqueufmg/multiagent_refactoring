    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DynamicType.Loaded has only outgoing dependencies to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType (2 outgoing) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows neither a large outgoing fan-out (only 2) nor any incoming dependencies, so the smell is not present."
