    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a small set of outgoing dependencies (4: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter) but is the target of many incoming dependencies (23 distinct clients in the provided data). Incoming callers include core/dynamic components (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, DynamicType.Builder, DynamicType.AbstractBase, DynamicType.FieldDefinition, DynamicType.Optional, etc.), scaffolding/type writer components (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter and its FieldPool/Record/ForImplicitField/ForExplicitField variants), registry classes (FieldRegistry, FieldRegistry.Compiled, FieldRegistry.Default, FieldRegistry.Entry) and ASM integration points (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension and its field-specific visitors), as well as its own nested factories (FieldAttributeAppender.Factory, FieldAttributeAppender.Compound). Being referenced by such a large and diverse set of other abstractions while also depending on several collaborators indicates it acts as a central hub connecting many modules — the hallmark of Hub-like Modularization."
