    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to four abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, and net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher. It has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 4 (not a large number), so the smell is not detected."
