    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has outgoing dependencies to only three abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription) and has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit that pattern."
