    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Bound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []) and only a single outgoing dependency (depends on 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'). Hub-like Modularization requires the class itself to have many incoming and outgoing couplings. Although 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' (the single outgoing dependency) has many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing relations of TypePool.Bound under the given data, so the smell does not apply."
