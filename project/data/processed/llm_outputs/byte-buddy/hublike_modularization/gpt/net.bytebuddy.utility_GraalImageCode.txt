    "justification": "GraalImageCode has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.GraalImageCode.ImageCodeContextAction, net.bytebuddy.utility.privilege.GetSystemPropertyAction) and 3 incoming dependencies (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader, net.bytebuddy.utility.GraalImageCode.ImageCodeContextAction, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). These are small numbers of direct incoming/outgoing relationships and do not constitute the large number of both incoming and outgoing connections required to qualify as Hub-like Modularization. (Although AccessControllerPlugin itself lists many dependencies, those are not additional direct incoming/outgoing links to GraalImageCode in the provided data.)"
