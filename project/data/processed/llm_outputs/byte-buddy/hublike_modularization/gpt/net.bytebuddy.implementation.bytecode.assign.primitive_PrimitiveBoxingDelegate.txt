    "justification": "PrimitiveBoxingDelegate has a small set of outgoing dependencies (6): net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It has a single incoming dependency (1): net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveTypeAwareAssigner. Given only 6 outgoing and 1 incoming dependency in the provided data, the class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships required to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
