    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.PosixOwnerProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine). Although net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine itself depends on many classes, the analyzed class is referenced by a single other abstraction and does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships. Therefore it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
