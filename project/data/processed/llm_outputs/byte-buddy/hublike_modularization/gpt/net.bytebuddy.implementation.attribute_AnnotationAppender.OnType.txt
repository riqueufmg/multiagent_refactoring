    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender.OnType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. Although the outgoing target (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself references many other types, those are indirect and do not constitute direct incoming/outgoing dependencies for this class."
