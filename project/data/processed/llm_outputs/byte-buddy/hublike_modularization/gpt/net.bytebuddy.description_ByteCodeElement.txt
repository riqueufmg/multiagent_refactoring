    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ByteCodeElement has a very high number of incoming dependencies (~45 distinct classes reference it, e.g. many net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.* classes, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList). Its direct outgoing dependencies are limited to 5 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.DeclaredByType, net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.NamedElement, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable). The hub-like modularization smell requires the abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; here incoming is large but outgoing is small, so the criterion is not met."
