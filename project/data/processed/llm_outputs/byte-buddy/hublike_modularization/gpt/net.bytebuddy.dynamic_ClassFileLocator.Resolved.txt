    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Resolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; here incoming_dependencies is empty and outgoing count is small. Although the two target classes themselves have many dependencies, the analysis must treat the class in isolation and therefore the class does not meet the criteria for a hub."
