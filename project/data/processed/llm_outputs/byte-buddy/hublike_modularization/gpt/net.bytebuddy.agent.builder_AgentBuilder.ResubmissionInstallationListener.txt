    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = 0) and only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Given the absence of incoming links and the small number of outgoing links, this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell. (Note: the large dependency lists of the referenced outgoing classes are not considered here because the analysis is constrained to the class in isolation.)"
