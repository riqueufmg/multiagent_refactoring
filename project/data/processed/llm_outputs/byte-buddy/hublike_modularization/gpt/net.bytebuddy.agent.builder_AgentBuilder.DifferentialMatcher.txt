    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer and net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming=0 and outgoing=2, so it is not a hub."
