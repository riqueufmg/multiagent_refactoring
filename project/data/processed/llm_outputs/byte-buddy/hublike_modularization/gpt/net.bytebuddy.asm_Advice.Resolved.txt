Incoming dependencies: only one containing class (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) is listed as depending on Advice.Resolved. The hub-like modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relations; here Advice.Resolved has multiple outgoing but only a single incoming abstraction in the provided data, so it does not meet the definition of a hub."
