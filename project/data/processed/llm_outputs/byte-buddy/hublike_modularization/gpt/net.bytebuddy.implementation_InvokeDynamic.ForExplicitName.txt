    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []) and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing target (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) depends on many classes, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing connections, so the smell is not detected."
