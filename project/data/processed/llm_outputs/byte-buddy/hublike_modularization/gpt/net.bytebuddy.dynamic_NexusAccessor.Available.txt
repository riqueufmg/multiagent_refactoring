    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although that outgoing dependency itself lists many dependencies, the class under analysis directly depends on only a single abstraction and has no incoming links, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
