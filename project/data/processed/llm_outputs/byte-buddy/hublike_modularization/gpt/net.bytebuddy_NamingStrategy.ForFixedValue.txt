    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit many direct incoming or outgoing connections."
