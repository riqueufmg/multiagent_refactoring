    "justification": "ArrayFactory.ForPrimitiveType has a single outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, and a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayFactory. The many types listed under the outgoing_dependencies entry are dependencies of the Implementation class, not of ForPrimitiveType. Given only one incoming and one outgoing relation, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (no large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
