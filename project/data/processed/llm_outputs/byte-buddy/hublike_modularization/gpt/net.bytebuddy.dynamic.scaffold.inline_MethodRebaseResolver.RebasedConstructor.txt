    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 8 distinct abstractions (MethodDescription, ParameterDescription, ParameterList, AnnotationList, TypeList, TypeDescription, AnnotationValue) but has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. While several of its outgoing targets (e.g., MethodDescription, TypeDescription) themselves depend on many other types, the analyzed class lacks incoming links entirely, so it does not exhibit a hub-like role."
