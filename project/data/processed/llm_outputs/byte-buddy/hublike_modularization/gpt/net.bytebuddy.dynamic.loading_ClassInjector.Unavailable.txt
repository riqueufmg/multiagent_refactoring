    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires having many incoming and many outgoing links. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies when considered in isolation."
