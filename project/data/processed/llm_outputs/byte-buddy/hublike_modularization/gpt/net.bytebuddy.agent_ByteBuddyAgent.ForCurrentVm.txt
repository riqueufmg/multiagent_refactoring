    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent). Although the incoming class lists many dependencies (including ForCurrentVm), the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships required for a hub-like modularization smell (incoming_count=1, outgoing_count=0). Therefore it is not a hub."
