Outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner). Although MethodDescription lists many related types, the analyzed class itself has only two direct outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not meet that criterion."
