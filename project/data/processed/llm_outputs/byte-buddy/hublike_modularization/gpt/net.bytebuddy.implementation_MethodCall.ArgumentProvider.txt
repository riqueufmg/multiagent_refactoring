The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections; this class does not show many direct incoming or outgoing dependencies (the fact that its outgoing targets have many dependencies themselves does not make this class a hub when considered in isolation)."
