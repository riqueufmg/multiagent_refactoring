    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess.TypeCastingHandler",

    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows a very small number of connections, so this is not a hub."
