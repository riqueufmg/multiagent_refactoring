    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Transformation.PluginResolvingClassLoader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although ClassFileLocator (the single outgoing dependency) itself references many types, the analyzed class in isolation does not have many incoming or outgoing relationships and therefore does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
