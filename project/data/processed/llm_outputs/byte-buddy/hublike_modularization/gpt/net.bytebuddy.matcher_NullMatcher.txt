    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.NullMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NullMatcher has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and only 1 incoming dependency source (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers). Although ElementMatchers itself references many types, NullMatcher is not directly connected (incoming and outgoing) to a large number of distinct abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
