    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. This class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only five outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentList, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList. Because it lacks incoming dependencies and does not exhibit a large number of bi-directional connections, it does not meet the hub-like modularization smell."
