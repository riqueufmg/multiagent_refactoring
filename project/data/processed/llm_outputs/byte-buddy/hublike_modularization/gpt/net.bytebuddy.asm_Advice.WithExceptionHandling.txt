Outgoing dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize) — a small set. Although some outgoing targets have many dependencies themselves, Hub-like Modularization requires the analyzed class to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has no incoming dependencies and only three outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the hub criterion."
