    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.ForDispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Implementation.ForDispatcher has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType). Although those two targets themselves depend on many other types, those are not direct dependencies of Implementation.ForDispatcher. Given the lack of many incoming relations and only two direct outgoing relations, this class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
