    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic). Hub-like modularization is characterized by dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low incoming/outgoing counts, so the smell is not detected."
