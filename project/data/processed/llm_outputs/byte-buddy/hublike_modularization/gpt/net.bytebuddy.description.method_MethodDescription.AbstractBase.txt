    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 10 distinct abstractions (TypeDefinition, MethodDescription, TypeVariableSource, ModifierContributor, CachedReturnPlugin, JavaType, AccessControllerPlugin, TypeList, TypeDescription, JavaDispatcher). Incoming dependencies: only 1 abstraction (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) depends on MethodDescription.AbstractBase. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here outgoing is relatively large but incoming is minimal (single incoming class). Therefore the class does not meet the hub-like criterion."
