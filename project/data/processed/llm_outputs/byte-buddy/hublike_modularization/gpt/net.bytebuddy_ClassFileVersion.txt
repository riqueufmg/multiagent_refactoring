    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ClassFileVersion has a very large number of incoming dependencies (well over 100 distinct classes reference it) from many packages and subsystems (examples: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, and many more listed in incoming_dependencies). It also has outgoing dependencies to several core abstractions (net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion.VersionLocator, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion.Resolver). The combination of very high incoming connectivity plus multiple outgoing links to central types matches the Hub-like Modularization smell: ClassFileVersion acts as a central hub referenced across many modules while also depending on several core abstractions."
