    "justification": "Direct incoming dependencies: only one class (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder) references AgentBuilder.DescriptionStrategy. Direct outgoing dependencies: three classes (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). That yields four distinct direct relationships. Although the outgoing targets themselves have large dependency lists, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; therefore it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
