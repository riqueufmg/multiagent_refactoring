    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.ForLifecycleTypes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). While its outgoing dependencies themselves have large fan-out (Plugin -> 37 dependent abstractions; ClassFileLocator -> 19 dependent abstractions), the smell 'Hub-like Modularization' requires the abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Because this class has no incoming dependencies, it does not meet the definition and is not detected as a hub."
