    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number of connections and therefore does not match the smell."
