    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.ForInteger",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced TypeDescription is highly connected, JavaConstant.ForInteger itself does not exhibit numerous incoming or outgoing relationships and therefore is not a hub."
