    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 4 direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class lacks incoming links and therefore does not meet the hub-like criteria (analysis performed in isolation using only the provided data)."
