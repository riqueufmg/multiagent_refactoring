    "justification": "MethodGraph.NodeList has outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList and net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList. The only incoming dependency recorded is a single class: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph (which lists MethodGraph.NodeList among its many dependencies). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing relationships; the provided data shows low fan-out (2) and a single incoming relationship, so this class is not a hub."
