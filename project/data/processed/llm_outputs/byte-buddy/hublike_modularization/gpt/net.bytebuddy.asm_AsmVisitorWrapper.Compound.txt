    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = 0) and only three outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not meet that criterion."
