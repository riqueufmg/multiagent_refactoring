    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have numerous incoming and outgoing relationships; because this class lacks incoming dependencies and its outgoing dependency set is small, it is not a hub."
