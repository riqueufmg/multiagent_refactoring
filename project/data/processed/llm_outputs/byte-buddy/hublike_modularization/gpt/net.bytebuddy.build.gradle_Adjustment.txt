    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Adjustment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Adjustment has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 3 incoming dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTaskExtension, net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTaskConfiguration, net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTaskConfiguration.TaskExecutionGraphAdjustmentAction). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships; Adjustment lacks outgoing dependencies and has a small number of incoming dependencies, so the smell is not present."
