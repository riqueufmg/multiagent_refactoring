Incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder references AgentBuilder.StreamWriting). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships. The analyzed class shows only a small number of incoming and outgoing links in the provided data, so it does not meet the criteria for a hub."
