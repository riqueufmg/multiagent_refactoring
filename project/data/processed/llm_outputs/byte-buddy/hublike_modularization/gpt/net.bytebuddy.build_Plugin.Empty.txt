    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Empty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Plugin.Empty has a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) and a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin). Although the referenced ClassFileLocator entry lists many of its own dependencies, Plugin.Empty itself directly connects to only one other abstraction in each direction. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (not many incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
