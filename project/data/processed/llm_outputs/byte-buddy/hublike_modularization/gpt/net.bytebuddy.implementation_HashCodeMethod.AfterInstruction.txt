    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and 0 incoming dependencies. Although those referenced classes themselves list many dependencies, the analysis must consider the class in isolation: it does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
