    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.EmptyAsmClassReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections. Although net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter references many types (including this class), EmptyAsmClassReader itself does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing dependencies and therefore is not a hub."
