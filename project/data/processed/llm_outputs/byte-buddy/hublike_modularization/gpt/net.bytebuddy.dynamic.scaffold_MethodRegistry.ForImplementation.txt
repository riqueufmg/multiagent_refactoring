    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.ForImplementation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []), so it is not acting as a hub receiving connections from many other abstractions. It has only four direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter. Although some of those outgoing types themselves reference many classes, the analyzed class in isolation lacks a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
