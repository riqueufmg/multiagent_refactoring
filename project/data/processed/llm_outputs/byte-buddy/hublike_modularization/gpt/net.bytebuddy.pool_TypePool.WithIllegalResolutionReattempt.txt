    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 16 distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and 15 related types such as MethodAttributeAppender, AnnotationDescription, MethodDescription, ElementMatchers, ClassFileLocator, EqualsMethod, DynamicType, FieldDescription, TypeDescription, etc.). Incoming dependencies: 0. Hub-like Modularization requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because this class has no incoming dependencies (only outgoing ones), it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
