    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only a single outgoing dependency (depends on net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections; this class does not meet either condition. Note: although the referenced AgentBuilder class (provided in outgoing_dependencies) itself lists many dependencies, those are dependencies of AgentBuilder, not of AgentBuilder.Matchable, and the analysis is limited to the Matchable class in isolation."
