    "justification": "The class has a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType) and a single direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList). Although TypeList itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of DynamicType.ExceptionDefinition. Given the low number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships in the provided data, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
