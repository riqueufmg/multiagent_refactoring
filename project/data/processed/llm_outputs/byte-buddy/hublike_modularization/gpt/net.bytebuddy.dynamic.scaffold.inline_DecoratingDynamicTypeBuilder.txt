    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.DecoratingDynamicTypeBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has many outgoing dependencies (26 distinct referenced abstractions such as net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, etc.) but zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies (high in-degree and high out-degree). Because incoming dependencies = 0, this class is not a hub under the provided data."
