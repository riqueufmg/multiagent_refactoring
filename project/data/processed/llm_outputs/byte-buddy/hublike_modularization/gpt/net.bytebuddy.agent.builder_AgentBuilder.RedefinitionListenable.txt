    "justification": "AgentBuilder.RedefinitionListenable has only 2 outgoing direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and only 1 incoming dependent class (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only a small number of direct incoming/outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
