    "justification": "Binder.Implicit has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder) and only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Although Implementation lists many dependencies, Binder.Implicit itself directly depends on a single abstraction and is referenced by a single abstraction, so it does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies and therefore does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
