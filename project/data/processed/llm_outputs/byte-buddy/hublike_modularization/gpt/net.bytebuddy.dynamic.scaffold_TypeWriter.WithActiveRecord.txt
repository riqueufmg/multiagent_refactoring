    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []) and only three outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter. Because there are zero incoming dependencies and only three outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
