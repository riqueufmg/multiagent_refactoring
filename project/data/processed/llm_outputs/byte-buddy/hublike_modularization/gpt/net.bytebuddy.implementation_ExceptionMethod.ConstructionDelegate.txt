    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.ExceptionMethod) and 5 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing connections."
