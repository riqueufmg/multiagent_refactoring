    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although TypePool references many other types, ForByteCodeElement itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
