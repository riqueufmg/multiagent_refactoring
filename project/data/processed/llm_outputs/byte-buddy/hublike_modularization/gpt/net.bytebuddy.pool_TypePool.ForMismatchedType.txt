    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization is not detected because the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). Although those outgoing targets have many dependencies themselves, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing ties required for a hub."
