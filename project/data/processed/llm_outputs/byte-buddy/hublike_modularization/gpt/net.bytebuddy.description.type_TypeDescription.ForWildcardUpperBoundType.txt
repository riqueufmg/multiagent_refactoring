    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections. The incoming_dependencies list is empty and the outgoing count is low, so this class does not qualify as a hub despite the outgoing targets themselves having many dependencies."
