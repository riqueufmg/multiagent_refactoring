    "justification": "Although the class has multiple outgoing dependencies (Assigner, AnnotationDescription, ConstantValue, StackManipulation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation), there are zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the in-degree is 0 while out-degree is 6, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
