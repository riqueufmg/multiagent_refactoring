    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion based on the provided data."
