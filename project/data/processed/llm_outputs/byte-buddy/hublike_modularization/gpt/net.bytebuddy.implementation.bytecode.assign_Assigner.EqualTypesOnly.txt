    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Considering the class in isolation, its connectivity is very small, so it does not qualify as a hub."
