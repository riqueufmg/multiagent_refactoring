    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.FieldVisitorWrapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires the class to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription) and zero incoming dependencies. Although FieldDescription itself depends on many types, those are not direct dependencies of AsmVisitorWrapper.FieldVisitorWrapper in the provided data, so the class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
