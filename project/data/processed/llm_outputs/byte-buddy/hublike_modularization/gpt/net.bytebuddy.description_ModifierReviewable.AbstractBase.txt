    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has many outgoing dependencies (16): net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.MethodStrictness, MethodManifestation, Openness, Visibility, SyntheticState, ParameterManifestation, RequiredPhase, Mandate, EnumerationState, FieldPersistence, Ownership, Transitivity, SynchronizationState, TypeManifestation, FieldManifestation, ProvisioningState. However, it has zero incoming dependencies. Because the incoming dependency count is 0 (no incoming relationships) the class does not meet the requirement of having many incoming and outgoing dependencies and therefore is not a hub-like modularization."
