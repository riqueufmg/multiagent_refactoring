    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer and net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not the case here."
