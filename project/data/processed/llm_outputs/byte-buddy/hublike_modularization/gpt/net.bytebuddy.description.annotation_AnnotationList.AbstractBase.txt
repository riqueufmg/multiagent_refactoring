    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Although the outgoing neighbors themselves list multiple dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing ties, so it is not a hub."
