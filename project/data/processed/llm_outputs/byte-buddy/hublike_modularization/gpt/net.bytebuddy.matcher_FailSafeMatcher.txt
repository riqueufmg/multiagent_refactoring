    "justification": "FailSafeMatcher has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing ties; given the empty incoming_dependencies and the small outgoing set, this class does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell. (Note: dependent classes listed have many dependencies, but the analysis is limited to this class in isolation.)"
