    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not exhibit that (incoming: [], outgoing: [net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin]). Note: although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many of its own dependencies, those do not increase the analyzed class's incoming/outgoing counts when the class is considered in isolation."
