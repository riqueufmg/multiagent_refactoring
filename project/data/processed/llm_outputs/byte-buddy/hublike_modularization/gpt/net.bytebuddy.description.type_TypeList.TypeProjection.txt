This class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin. Because there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing dependency count is very small, the Hub-like Modularization smell is not detected."
