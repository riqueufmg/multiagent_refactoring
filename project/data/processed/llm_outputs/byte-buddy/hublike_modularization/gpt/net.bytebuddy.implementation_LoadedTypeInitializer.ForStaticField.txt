    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer.ForStaticField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. In the provided data this class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin. Although those three targets themselves list many collaborators, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
