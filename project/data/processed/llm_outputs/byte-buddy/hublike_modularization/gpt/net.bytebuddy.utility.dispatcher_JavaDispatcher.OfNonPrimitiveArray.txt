    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.OfNonPrimitiveArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only a single outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; that condition is not met. (Note: the outgoing target lists many of its own dependencies, but the analyzed class directly depends on only one abstraction per the provided data.)"
