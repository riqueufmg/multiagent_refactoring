    "justification": "This class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The provided metrics (outgoing count = 1, incoming count = 0) do not meet that criterion. Note: although the outgoing dependency itself references many other types, those are dependencies of net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, not direct incoming/outgoing ties of this class."
