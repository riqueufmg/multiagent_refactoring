    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and only one incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies to and from a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows low incoming and outgoing coupling for this class. (Note: JavaDispatcher itself lists many dependencies, but the analyzed class depends on that single abstraction only; per the constraint to consider the class in isolation, transitive counts are not assumed.)"
