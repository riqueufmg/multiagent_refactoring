    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited to 4 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator. Incoming dependencies include only a single abstraction: net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic (which lists InvokeDynamic.WithImplicitType among its dependencies). Because the class has a small number of incoming (1) and outgoing (4) relationships in the provided data, it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell (which requires many incoming and many outgoing connections)."
