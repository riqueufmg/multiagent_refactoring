    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing connections, so it is not a hub. (Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many dependencies, the analyzed class itself has only a single outgoing link and no incoming links.)"
