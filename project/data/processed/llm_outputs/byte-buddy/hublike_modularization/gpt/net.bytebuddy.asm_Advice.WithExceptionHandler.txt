    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithExceptionHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to only three abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced targets themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation does not have high fan-in or fan-out (incoming_dependencies is empty; outgoing count = 3), so it is not a hub."
