    "justification": "MethodCall.Simple has a small set of outgoing dependencies (4): net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation. It has a single incoming dependency provided (1): net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall (which references MethodCall.Simple). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; here both in-degree (1) and out-degree (4) are low, so the smell is not detected."
