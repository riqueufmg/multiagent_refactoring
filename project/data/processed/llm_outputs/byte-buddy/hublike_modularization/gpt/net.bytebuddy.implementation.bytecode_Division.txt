    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; Division does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in isolation."
