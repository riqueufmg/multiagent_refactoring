    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to five abstractions: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation (outgoing count = 5). It has no incoming dependencies (incoming count = 0). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because this class lacks incoming dependencies, it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
