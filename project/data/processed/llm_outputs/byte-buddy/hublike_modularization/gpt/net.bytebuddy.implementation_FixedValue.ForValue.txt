    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FixedValue.ForValue has a modest number of direct outgoing dependencies (5: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and only a single incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships. The incoming degree (1) is low and the outgoing degree (5) is modest and consistent with a focused responsibility, so this class does not exhibit a hub-like coupling pattern."
