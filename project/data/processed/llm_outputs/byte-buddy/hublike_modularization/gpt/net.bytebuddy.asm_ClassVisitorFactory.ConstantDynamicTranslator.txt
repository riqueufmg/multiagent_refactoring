    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.ConstantDynamicTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 4 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, and only 1 incoming dependency: net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class exhibits a small number of incoming dependents and therefore does not qualify."
