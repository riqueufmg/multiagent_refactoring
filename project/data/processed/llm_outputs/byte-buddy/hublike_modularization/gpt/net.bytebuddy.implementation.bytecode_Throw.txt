    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: Throw directly depends on only 2 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize). Incoming dependencies: 6 classes reference Throw (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Default, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ExceptionHandler, net.bytebuddy.implementation.ExceptionMethod, net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy, net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy.AbstractMethodErrorThrow). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here outgoing fan-out is small (2), so Throw does not meet the hub-like criterion despite having multiple incoming references."
