    "class": "net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. While that TypeDescription element itself references a large set of other types (≈56 entries, e.g. TypeDescription.WithEagerNavigation, TypeDescription.OfParameterizedType, TypeDefinition, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, TypeDescription.Generic), NamingStrategy.AbstractBase does not directly have a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships. Therefore it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
