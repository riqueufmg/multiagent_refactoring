    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin has many of its own dependencies, the analyzed class interacts with only a single other abstraction and has no incoming links, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
