    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 6 distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication). Incoming dependencies: 1 abstraction (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the outgoing set is moderate but the incoming set is minimal (single incoming), so the class does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
