    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 7 distinct abstractions (TypeList, RecordComponentDescription, MethodDescription, CachedReturnPlugin, FieldDescription, AnnotationSource, TypeDescription). Incoming dependencies: 1 abstraction (TypeDescription) references this class. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming dependencies are limited to a single class, so the class does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
