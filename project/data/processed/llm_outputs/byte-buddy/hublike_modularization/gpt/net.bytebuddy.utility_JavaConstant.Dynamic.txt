    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.Dynamic",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions (EnumerationDescription, MethodDescription, JavaConstant, FieldDescription, JavaType, TypeList, TypeDescription) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Because there are no incoming ties, it does not meet the definition's requirement of having large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
