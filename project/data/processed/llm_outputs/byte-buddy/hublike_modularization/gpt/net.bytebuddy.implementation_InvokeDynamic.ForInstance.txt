    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, but there are zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many dependencies both incoming and outgoing; because this class lacks incoming dependencies it does not meet the definition."
