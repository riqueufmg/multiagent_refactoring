    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; this class exhibits neither high fan-in nor high fan-out. Although the outgoing target (OpenedClassReader) lists additional dependencies, those are indirect/transitive and do not make the analyzed class itself hub-like based on the provided, isolated data."
