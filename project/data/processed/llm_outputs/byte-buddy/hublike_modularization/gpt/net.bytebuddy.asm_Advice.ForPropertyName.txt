    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForPropertyName",

    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor) and only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Although the referenced FieldAccessor class itself depends on many types, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
