    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing dependency count is small, it does not meet the hub-like modularization criteria."
