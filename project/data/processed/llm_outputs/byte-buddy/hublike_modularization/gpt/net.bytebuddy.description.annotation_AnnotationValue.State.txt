    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.State",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections. Although the incoming class (AnnotationValue) lists many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not present."
