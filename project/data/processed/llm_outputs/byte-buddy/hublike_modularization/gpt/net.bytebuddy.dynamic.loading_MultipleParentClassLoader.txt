    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MultipleParentClassLoader is not a hub: it has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy) and only 2 incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory, net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.CreateClassVisitorFactory). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction with a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; the provided data shows a low number of direct connections. Note: ClassLoadingStrategy itself lists many internal dependencies, but those are not direct additional incoming/outgoing links to MultipleParentClassLoader and therefore do not make it a hub."
