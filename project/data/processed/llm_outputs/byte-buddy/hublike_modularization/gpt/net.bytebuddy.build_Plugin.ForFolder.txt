    "justification": "Plugin.ForFolder has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing relationships. Although the two outgoing targets themselves depend on many classes, Plugin.ForFolder itself is not a hub."
