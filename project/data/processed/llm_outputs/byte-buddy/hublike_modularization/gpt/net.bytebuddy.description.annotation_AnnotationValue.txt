    "justification": "AnnotationValue exhibits hub-like modularization: it has a large number of outgoing dependencies (17 direct outgoing dependencies, e.g. AnnotationValue.ForMissingType, AnnotationDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, ClassFileLocator, ClassFileVersion, CachedReturnPlugin, AnnotationValue.RenderingDispatcher, AnnotationValue.AbstractBase, AnnotationValue.Loaded) while being depended upon by a very large set of other abstractions (75 incoming dependencies, including core components such as net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter and its nested types, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool and its variants, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice and MemberSubstitution families, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation and related classes, ByteBuddy, and many MethodDescription/AnnotationDescription related types). This high fan-out combined with very high fan-in (many unrelated packages and subsystems both use and are used by AnnotationValue) matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
