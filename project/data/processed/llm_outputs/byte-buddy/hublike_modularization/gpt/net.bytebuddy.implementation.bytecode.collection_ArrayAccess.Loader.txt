    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayAccess.Loader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number of either, so the smell is not detected."
