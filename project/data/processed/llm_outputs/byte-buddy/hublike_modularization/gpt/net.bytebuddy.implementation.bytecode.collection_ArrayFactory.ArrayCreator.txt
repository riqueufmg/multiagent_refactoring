    "justification": "Hub-like modularization is not detected because the class has a small number of outgoing and incoming dependencies. Outgoing dependencies: 4 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Incoming dependencies: 1 (referenced by net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayFactory). A hub-like smell requires many incoming and many outgoing links; the provided data shows only a single incoming and four outgoing relationships, which does not meet that criterion."
