    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.RecordComponentAttributeAppender. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; this class's direct dependency counts (incoming=0, outgoing=2) are low, so it is not a hub."
