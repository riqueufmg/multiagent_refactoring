    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ModuleReadEdgeCompleting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; although the outgoing targets themselves have many transitive dependencies, the analyzed class has no incoming links and therefore does not meet the hub-like criterion."
