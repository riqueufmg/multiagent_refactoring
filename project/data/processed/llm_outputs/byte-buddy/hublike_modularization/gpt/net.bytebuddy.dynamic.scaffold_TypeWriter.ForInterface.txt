    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForInterface",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one direct outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, and only one direct incoming dependency entry: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter. Although MethodDescription itself references many types, the analysis is constrained to this class in isolation and therefore transitive dependencies of referenced types are not counted. With only one incoming and one outgoing direct dependency, this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization (which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions)."
