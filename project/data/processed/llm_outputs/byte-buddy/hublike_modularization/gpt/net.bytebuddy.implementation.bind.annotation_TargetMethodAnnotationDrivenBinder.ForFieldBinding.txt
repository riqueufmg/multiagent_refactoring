    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder.ForFieldBinding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to five abstractions: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder, but it has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming dependency count is zero, so the class is not a hub."
