    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyParameterizedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, and net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both large numbers of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Neither condition is met: zero incoming dependencies and a small number (3) of outgoing dependencies. Note that although net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool (one outgoing) lists many dependencies, those are dependencies of that target class and do not constitute additional direct incoming/outgoing relations for the analyzed class when considered in isolation."
