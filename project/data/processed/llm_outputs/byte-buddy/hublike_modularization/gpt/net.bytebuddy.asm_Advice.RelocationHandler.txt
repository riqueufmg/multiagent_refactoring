    "justification": "Incoming dependencies are minimal: only net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice references Advice.RelocationHandler. Outgoing dependencies are limited to five classes: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation (5 total). Because the class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, it does not qualify as a hub-like modularization."
