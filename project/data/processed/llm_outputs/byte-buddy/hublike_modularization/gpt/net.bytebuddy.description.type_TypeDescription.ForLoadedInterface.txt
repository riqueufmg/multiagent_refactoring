    "justification": "Not a hub: the analyzed class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. Although HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself depends on many types, the analyzed class does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies per the provided data."
