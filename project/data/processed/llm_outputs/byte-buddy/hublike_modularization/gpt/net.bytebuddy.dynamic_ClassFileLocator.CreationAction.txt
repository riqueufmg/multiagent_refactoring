    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). A hub requires many incoming and outgoing links; here CreationAction is referenced by a single abstraction and does not depend on other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
