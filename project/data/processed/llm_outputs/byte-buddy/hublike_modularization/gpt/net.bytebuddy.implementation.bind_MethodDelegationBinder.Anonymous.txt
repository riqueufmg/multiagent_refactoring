    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Anonymous",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and 0 incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. (While some referenced classes show many internal dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit high incoming/outgoing coupling.)"
