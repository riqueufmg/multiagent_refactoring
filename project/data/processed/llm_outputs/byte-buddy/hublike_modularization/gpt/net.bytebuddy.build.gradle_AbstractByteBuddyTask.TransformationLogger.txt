    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTask.TransformationLogger",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin (listed in analyzed_package.dependencies). It has a single incoming dependency entry: net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTask (which lists AbstractByteBuddyTask.TransformationLogger among its dependencies). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies with numerous other abstractions. The many dependencies shown under net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin are dependencies of Plugin itself, not direct incoming/outgoing relationships of AbstractByteBuddyTask.TransformationLogger, so the class is not a hub."
