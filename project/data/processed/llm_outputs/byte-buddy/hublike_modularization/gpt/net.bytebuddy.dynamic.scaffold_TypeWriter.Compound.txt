Outgoing dependencies: a single direct dependency on net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin (only one outgoing). Although that target has many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not have many incoming and outgoing connections. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition."
