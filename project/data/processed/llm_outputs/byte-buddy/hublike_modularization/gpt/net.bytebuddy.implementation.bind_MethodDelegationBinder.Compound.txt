    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows no large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies for this class. Note: the outgoing target lists many dependencies, but those are not direct dependencies of MethodDelegationBinder.Compound in the provided data."
