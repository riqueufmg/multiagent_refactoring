    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin). Although that outgoing dependency (CachedReturnPlugin) itself references many other abstractions, the analyzed class does not have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies required for Hub-like Modularization. Evidence: analyzed_package.dependencies = [net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin]; outgoing_dependencies contains a single entry for CachedReturnPlugin; incoming_dependencies = []."
