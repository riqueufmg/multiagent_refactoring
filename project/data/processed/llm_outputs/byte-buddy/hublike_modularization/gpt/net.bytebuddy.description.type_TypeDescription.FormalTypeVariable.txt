    "justification": "The class has only one recorded outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher. It has only one recorded incoming dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription (which lists TypeDescription.FormalTypeVariable). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Both incoming and outgoing counts are minimal (1 each), so the hub-like smell is not detected. Note: JavaDispatcher itself depends on many classes, but that reflects dependencies of the outgoing target, not multiple outgoing links from this class; the analysis is performed in isolation."
