    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader and net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; the provided data shows neither many incoming nor many outgoing links for this class. Although the outgoing targets themselves have additional dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like connectivity."
