    "justification": "AnnotationStripper has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data does not show a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies."
