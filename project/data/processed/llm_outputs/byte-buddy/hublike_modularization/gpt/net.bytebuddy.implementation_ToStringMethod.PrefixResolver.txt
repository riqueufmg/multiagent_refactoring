    "justification": "Direct incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.implementation.ToStringMethod references ToStringMethod.PrefixResolver). Direct outgoing dependencies: 1 (ToStringMethod.PrefixResolver depends on net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the class has only a single incoming and a single outgoing dependency, so it is not a hub."
