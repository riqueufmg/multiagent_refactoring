    "justification": "Plugin.ForElementMatcher has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows limited direct coupling. (Note: one outgoing target, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, has many transitive dependencies, but Plugin.ForElementMatcher itself does not exhibit many direct incoming/outgoing links.)"
