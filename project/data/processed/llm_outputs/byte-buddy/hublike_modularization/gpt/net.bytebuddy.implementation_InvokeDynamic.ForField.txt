    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small set of direct outgoing dependencies (5): net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It has a single incoming dependency entry (net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic) referencing InvokeDynamic.ForField. While several of the types it depends on themselves reference many other abstractions, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization. Therefore the smell is not detected."
