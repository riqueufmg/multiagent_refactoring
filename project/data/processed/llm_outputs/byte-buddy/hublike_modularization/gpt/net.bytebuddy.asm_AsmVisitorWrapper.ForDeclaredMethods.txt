    "justification": "The class has multiple outgoing dependencies (8): net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. However, it has zero incoming dependencies in the provided data. The definition of Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because incoming dependencies are absent, this class does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
