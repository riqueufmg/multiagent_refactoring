    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AsmClassWriter.JdkClassWriter has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although the referenced JavaDispatcher and AsmClassWriter themselves depend on many types, AsmClassWriter.JdkClassWriter in isolation is connected only to these two classes and therefore does not meet the hub-like criteria."
