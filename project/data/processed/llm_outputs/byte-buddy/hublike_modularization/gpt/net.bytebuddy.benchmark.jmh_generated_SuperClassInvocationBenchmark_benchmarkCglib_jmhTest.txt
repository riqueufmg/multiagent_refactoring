    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.SuperClassInvocationBenchmark_jmhType) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
