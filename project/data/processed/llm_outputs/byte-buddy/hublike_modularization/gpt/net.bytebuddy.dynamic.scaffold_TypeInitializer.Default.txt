    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has outgoing dependencies to six distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription (outgoing count = 6). However, it has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Considering the class in isolation (no transitive or system-level context), the absence of incoming dependencies means it does not exhibit the required bidirectional high-degree coupling for a hub. Therefore the smell is not detected."
