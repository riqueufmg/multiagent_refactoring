    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Although one outgoing target (TypeDescription) lists many of its own dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not show a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
