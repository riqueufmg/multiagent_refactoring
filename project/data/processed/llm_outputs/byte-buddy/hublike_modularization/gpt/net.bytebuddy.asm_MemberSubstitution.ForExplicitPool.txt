    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Considering the class in isolation, its in-degree = 0 and out-degree = 2, which does not constitute a hub-like modularization."
