    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 5 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies, it does not meet the criterion of having widespread bidirectional coupling and therefore is not a hub."
