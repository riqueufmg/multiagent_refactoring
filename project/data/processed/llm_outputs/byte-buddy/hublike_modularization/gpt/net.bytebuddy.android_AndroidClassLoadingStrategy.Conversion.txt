    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy (incoming_dependencies contains only that class). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here Conversion has neither multiple incoming nor any outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
