    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class lacks many incoming connections and thus is not a hub. (Note: the referenced outgoing classes themselves have many dependencies, but that does not make the analyzed class a hub.)"
