    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires the class to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The provided data shows incoming_dependencies = [] (no incoming couplings) and only two direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription. Although TypeDescription (one outgoing target) has many further dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of FieldList.ForTokens. Given the absence of incoming dependencies and only two direct outgoing dependencies, FieldList.ForTokens does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
