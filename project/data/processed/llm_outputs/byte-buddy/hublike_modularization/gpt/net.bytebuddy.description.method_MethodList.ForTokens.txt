    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. For net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList.ForTokens: incoming_dependencies = 0 (none); outgoing dependencies = 2: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Because the class has no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the 'large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies' criterion. (Note: although the two outgoing classes themselves list many dependencies, the analysis is constrained to consider the class in isolation.)"
