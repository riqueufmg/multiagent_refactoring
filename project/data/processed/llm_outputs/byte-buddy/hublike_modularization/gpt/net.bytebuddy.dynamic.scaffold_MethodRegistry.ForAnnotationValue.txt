    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.ForAnnotationValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only four outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 4, so the condition is not met. Although the referenced outgoing classes have many dependencies themselves, that does not make this class a hub when considered in isolation."
