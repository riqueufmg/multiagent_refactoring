    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.UsingMethodHandle",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No: the class has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only four direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; this class lacks incoming links and has a small set of direct outgoing links. (Although the outgoing classes themselves list many dependencies, the analysis is limited to the class in isolation and its direct dependencies.)"
