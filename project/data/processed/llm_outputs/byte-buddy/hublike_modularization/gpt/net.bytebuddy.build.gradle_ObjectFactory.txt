    "justification": "ObjectFactory has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ObjectFactory.Dispatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ObjectFactory.ForLegacyGradle) and only 2 incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTaskExtension, net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTask). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the observed incoming and outgoing degrees are low, so the hub smell is not detected."
