    "justification": "AnnotationRemoval has numerous outgoing dependencies (12): net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. However, it has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many dependencies in both directions (many incoming and many outgoing). Because there are no incoming dependencies, this class does not meet the definition of a hub and the smell is not detected."
