    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to six abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodAccessorFactory, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) but has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Because there are no incoming dependencies, the class does not meet the bidirectional connectivity criterion for this smell."
