    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.ForJava7CapableVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the single outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) references many other types (16 listed), the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
