    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit that pattern."
