    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ParameterToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many of its own dependencies, TypePool.ParameterToken itself is connected to only that single class, so it is not a hub."
