    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has neither a large number of outgoing dependents nor any incoming dependents, so it is not a hub."
