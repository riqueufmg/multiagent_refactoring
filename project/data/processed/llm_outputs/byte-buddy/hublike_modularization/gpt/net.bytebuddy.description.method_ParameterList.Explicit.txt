    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. Although the referenced outgoing classes themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation shows limited coupling."
