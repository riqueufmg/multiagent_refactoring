    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has a small set of outgoing dependencies (4 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList) and only a single incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). A hub smell requires many incoming and many outgoing relationships; this class does not exhibit a large number of distinct incoming dependents nor a large number of distinct outgoing dependences in the provided data."
