    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: only one incoming abstraction (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). Outgoing dependencies: three abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.NullConstant). Both incoming and outgoing adjacency are small; the class does not have dependencies to a large number of other abstractions and therefore does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
