    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.UsingUnsafe",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector and net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. Although ClassInjector itself lists many dependencies, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
