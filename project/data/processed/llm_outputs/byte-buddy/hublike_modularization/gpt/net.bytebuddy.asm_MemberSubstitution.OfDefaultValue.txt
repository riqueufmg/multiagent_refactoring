Outgoing dependencies (4): net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only four outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
