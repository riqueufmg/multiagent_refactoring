    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.RedefinitionDynamicTypeBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although RedefinitionDynamicTypeBuilder has a large number of outgoing dependencies (23 distinct external abstractions, e.g. TypeWriter, MethodRegistry, TypePool, TypeDescription, DynamicType, AsmClassWriter, InstrumentedType), it has zero incoming dependencies (no other abstractions depend on it in the provided data). Because the incoming dependency count is zero, the class does not meet the 'both incoming and outgoing' requirement for the hub-like modularization smell."
