    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "OpenedClassReader has very high incoming coupling (referenced by a large number of other abstractions — counted ~87 incoming dependents including many net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter variants, net.bytebuddy.asm.* classes such as AsmVisitorWrapper and Advice, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool and its extractors, etc.). However, its outgoing coupling is small: it directly depends on only three abstractions (net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because OpenedClassReader's fan-out is low (3) despite its high fan-in, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
