    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 4 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, and 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies (incoming = 0) it does not meet the definition of a hub despite multiple outgoing links."
