    "justification": "The class has a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner) and a single incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic). Although the outgoing target (Assigner) and the incoming depender (InvokeDynamic) themselves reference many other abstractions, the analyzed class does not directly have a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies required to qualify as a hub-like modularization."
