    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForContextualInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ForContextualInvocation has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). The smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relations; the provided data shows limited incoming (1) and limited outgoing (3), so it does not qualify as hub-like modularization."
