    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Access",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription) and a single incoming dependency entry (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Because it interacts directly with a small number of other abstractions (2 outgoing, 1 incoming), it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
