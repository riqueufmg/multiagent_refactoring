    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForLoadedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ForLoadedType has a substantial number of outgoing dependencies (15 distinct abstractions referenced, including RecordComponentDescription, MethodDescription, FieldList, MethodList, FieldComparator, ModuleDescription, PackageDescription, CachedReturnPlugin, AccessControllerPlugin, FieldDescription, AnnotationList, RecordComponentList, TypeList, TypeDescription, JavaDispatcher). However, it has only a single incoming dependency listed (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing ties. Because the incoming fan-in is low (only TypeDescription depends on ForLoadedType) despite the high outgoing fan-out, the smell is not detected."
