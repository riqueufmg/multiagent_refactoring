    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []) and only 1 outgoing dependency (outgoing_dependencies: [net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin]). The transitive/deeper dependency list shown under HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin are dependencies of that class, not direct incoming/outgoing ties of AgentBuilder.Disjunction, so they do not make the analyzed class a hub."
