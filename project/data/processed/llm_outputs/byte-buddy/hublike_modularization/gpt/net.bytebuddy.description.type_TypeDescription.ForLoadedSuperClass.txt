    "justification": "Incoming dependency count = 0 (no incoming_dependencies). Outgoing dependencies = 3: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only three direct outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected. Note: although one outgoing target (TypeDescription) references many types, analysis is performed in isolation and those are not direct incoming dependencies of this class."
