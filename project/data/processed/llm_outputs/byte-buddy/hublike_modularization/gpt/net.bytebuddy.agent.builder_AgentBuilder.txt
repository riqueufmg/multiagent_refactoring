    "justification": "AgentBuilder exhibits hub-like modularization: it has dependencies to a large number of other abstractions (dozens of outgoing dependencies) and is depended upon by many other abstractions (multiple incoming dependencies). Outgoing examples include: TypePool, ByteBuddy, Implementation, DynamicType, ClassFileLocator, ClassLoadingStrategy, InstrumentedType, ResettableClassFileTransformer, JavaModule, NamingStrategy, AgentBuilder.Default, AgentBuilder.Dispatcher, AgentBuilder.Transformer, AgentBuilder.InitializationStrategy, AgentBuilder.LambdaInstrumentationStrategy, AgentBuilder.Factory, AgentBuilder.Listener, AgentBuilder.Collector, and many more (the provided outgoing_dependencies list contains numerous net.bytebuddy.* types and many AgentBuilder inner types). Incoming examples include: ResettableClassFileTransformer (and its variants), ResettableClassFileTransformer.WithDelegation, ResettableClassFileTransformer.Substitutable, AgentBuilder.Default, AgentBuilder.Listener, AgentBuilder.Disabled, AgentBuilder.RedefinitionStrategy, AgentBuilder.ResubmissionStrategy, AgentBuilder.Enabled, AgentBuilder.Resubmitter, AgentBuilder.ForRedefinition, AgentBuilder.ForRetransformation, AgentBuilder.Delegator, AgentBuilder.Collector, etc. The combination of many incoming and many outgoing links (across core packages and many inner/related types) matches the definition of a hub: the abstraction both depends on and is depended upon by a large number of other abstractions, making it a central coupling point."
