This class has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). With no incoming dependencies and only three outgoing links, it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
