    "justification": "TypeDescription.ArrayProjection has many outgoing dependencies (13): RecordComponentDescription, MethodDescription, FieldList, MethodList, ModuleDescription, StackSize, PackageDescription, AnnotationList, FieldDescription, RecordComponentList, TypeList, TypeDescription. However, it has 0 incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because incoming dependencies are absent, the smell is not detected."
