This class has outgoing dependencies to 5 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.utility.RandomString; net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion; net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin; net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin; net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Because it lacks incoming dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
