    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.OfInstrumentedMethod",

    "justification": "Analyzed in isolation, the class has a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). Although the Implementation class itself lists many dependencies, the smell must be determined for the class itself; MethodCall.OfInstrumentedMethod does not have incoming and outgoing connections with a large number of other abstractions (incoming count = 1, outgoing count = 1). Therefore it is not hub-like."
