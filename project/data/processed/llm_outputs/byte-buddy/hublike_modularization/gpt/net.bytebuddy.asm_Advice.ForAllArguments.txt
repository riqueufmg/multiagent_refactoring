Incoming dependencies: only 1 abstraction references this class (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing couplings. While this class has numerous outgoing dependencies, it has a single incoming dependency in the provided data, so it does not meet the definition of a hub (highly connected both ways)."
