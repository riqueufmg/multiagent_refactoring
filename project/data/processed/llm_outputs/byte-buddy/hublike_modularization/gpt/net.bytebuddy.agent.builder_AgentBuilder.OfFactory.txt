    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector. Although those two target classes themselves depend on many other types, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing ties and therefore does not qualify as a hub."
