    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to exhibit many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType (the single incoming depender) itself references many types, the analyzed class net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.InnerTypeDefinition does not have the necessary large number of incoming and outgoing relationships to be considered a hub."
