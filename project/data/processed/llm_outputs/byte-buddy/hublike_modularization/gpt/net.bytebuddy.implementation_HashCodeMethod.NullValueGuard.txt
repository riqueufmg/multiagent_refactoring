    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 5 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not exhibit a large number of incoming dependents and thus is not a hub."
