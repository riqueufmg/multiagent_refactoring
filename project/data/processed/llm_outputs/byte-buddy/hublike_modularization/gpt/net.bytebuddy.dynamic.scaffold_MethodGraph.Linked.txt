    "justification": "MethodGraph.Linked has a small set of direct connections: 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph). Because the class does not have a large number of distinct incoming and outgoing abstraction dependencies (incoming = 1, outgoing = 3), it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
