    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForDefaultValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the analyzed class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) and 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. While the outgoing targets themselves reference many other types, the direct fan-in (1) and fan-out (3) for Advice.ForDefaultValue are low and do not meet the hub-like criteria."
