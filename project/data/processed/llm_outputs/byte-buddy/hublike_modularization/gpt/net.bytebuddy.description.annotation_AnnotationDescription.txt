    "justification": "AnnotationDescription has a hub-like coupling: it has 13 explicit outgoing dependencies (e.g. AnnotationDescription.RenderingDispatcher, ClassLoadingStrategy, EnumerationDescription, MethodDescription, AnnotationDescription.Loadable, ClassFileVersion, CachedReturnPlugin, AccessControllerPlugin, AnnotationList, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeList, TypeDescription, AnnotationValue) and is referenced by a very large set of incoming dependents across many packages and subsystems. Representative incoming dependents include core dynamic types (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, DynamicType.Builder, DynamicType.AbstractBase, DynamicType.MethodDefinition, DynamicType.ImplementationDefinition), many asm/Advice classes (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice and numerous nested Advice.* classes), extensive MemberSubstitution classes (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution and many nested types), pool and type resolution classes (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool and its variants), build plugins (net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, ToStringPlugin), implementation and binder classes (implementation.attribute/AnnotationAppender, implementation.bind.annotation.*), and many other description types (AnnotationList, AnnotationValue, MethodDescription, TypeDescription). The presence of numerous incoming callers from diverse modules combined with many outgoing links to core abstractions indicates the class functions as a central hub, satisfying the Hub-like Modularization smell."
