    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has outgoing dependencies to four abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, and net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription. Its incoming_dependencies list is empty (0 incoming). Because there are no incoming dependencies (and only 4 outgoing), the class does not meet the hub-like modularization smell criteria."
