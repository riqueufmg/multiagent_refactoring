    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 3, which are low, so the smell is not present."
