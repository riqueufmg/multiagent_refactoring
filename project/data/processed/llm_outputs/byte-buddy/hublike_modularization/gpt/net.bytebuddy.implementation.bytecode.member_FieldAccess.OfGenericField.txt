    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.FieldAccess.OfGenericField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. Although the referenced outgoing classes have many dependencies themselves, the analysis is limited to the class in isolation and its direct incoming/outgoing relationships."
