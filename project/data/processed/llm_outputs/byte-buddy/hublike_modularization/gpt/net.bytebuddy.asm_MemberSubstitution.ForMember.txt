    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMember",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MemberSubstitution.ForMember has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because incoming dependencies are absent (0), this class does not meet the hub-like criterion despite multiple outgoing links."
