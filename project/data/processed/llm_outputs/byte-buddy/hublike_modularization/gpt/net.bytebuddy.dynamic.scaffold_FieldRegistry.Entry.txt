    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. This class has outgoing dependencies to five distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender) and zero incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies (and the outgoing set is not exceptionally large), the criteria for a hub-like module are not met."
