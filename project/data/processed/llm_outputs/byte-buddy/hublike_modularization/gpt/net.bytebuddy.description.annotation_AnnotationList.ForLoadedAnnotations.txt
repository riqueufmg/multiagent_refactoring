    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; these counts (outgoing=1, incoming=0) do not meet that criterion."
