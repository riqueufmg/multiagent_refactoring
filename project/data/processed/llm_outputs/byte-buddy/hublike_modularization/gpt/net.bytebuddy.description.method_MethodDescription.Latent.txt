    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue (outgoing count = 7). However, it has zero incoming dependencies (incoming count = 0). Because it lacks incoming dependencies, it does not exhibit the bidirectional, high-degree coupling characteristic of a hub, so the Hub-like Modularization smell is not detected."
