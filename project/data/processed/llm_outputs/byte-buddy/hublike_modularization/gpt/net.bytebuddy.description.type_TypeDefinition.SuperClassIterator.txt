    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (to net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. In isolation this class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing connections, so it does not qualify as a hub."
