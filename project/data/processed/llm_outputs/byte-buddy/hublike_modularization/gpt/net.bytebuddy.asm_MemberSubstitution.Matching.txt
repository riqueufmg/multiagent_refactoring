    "justification": "The class is not a hub. Incoming dependencies are empty (no other abstractions depend on it). Its outgoing dependency set contains only 5 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 5, so the criterion is not met."
