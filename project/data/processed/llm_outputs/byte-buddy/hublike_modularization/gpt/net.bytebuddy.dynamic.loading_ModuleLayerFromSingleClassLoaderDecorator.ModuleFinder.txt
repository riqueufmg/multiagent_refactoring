    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.ModuleFinder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has many incoming dependencies (≈23) from types such as ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.ModuleLayer, CreationAction, SimpleModuleFinder, ModuleDescription, ModuleLayerController, ClassLoaderDecorator, etc., but only a single outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing dependency set is minimal, so the smell is not detected."
