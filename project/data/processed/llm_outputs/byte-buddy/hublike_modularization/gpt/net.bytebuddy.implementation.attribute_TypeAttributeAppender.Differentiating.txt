    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.TypeAttributeAppender.Differentiating",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 4 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The provided data shows neither a large number of outgoing dependencies (count = 4) nor any incoming dependencies, so the smell is not present."
