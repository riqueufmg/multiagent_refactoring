    "justification": "AgentBuilder.BatchReallocator has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction itself to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; those conditions are not met here. Although the single outgoing target (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) has many dependencies, that represents second-level connectivity and does not make BatchReallocator a hub when analyzed in isolation."
