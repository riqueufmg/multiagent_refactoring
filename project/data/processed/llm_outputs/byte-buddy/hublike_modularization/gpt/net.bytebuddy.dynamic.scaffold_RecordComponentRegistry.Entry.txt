    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.RecordComponentAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) but has ZERO incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires both many incoming and many outgoing connections; the absence of incoming dependencies prevents this being classified as a hub."
