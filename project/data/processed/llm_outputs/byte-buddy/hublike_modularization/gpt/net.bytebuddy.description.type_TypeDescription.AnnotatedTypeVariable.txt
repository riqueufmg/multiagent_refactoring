    "justification": "This class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and only 1 incoming dependency entry (from net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low fan-in (1) and low fan-out (1), so it is not a hub."
