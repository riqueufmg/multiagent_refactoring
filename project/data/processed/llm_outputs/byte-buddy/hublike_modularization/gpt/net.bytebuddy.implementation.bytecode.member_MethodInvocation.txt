    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. MethodInvocation has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (12 distinct targets: HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeList, MethodInvocation.IllegalInvocation, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, ClassFileVersion, JavaConstant, JavaType, MethodInvocation.WithImplicitInvocationTargetType, Implementation, TypeDescription, MethodInvocation.HandleType) but only a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder). Because the incoming dependency count is very low (1) while outgoing is not matched by many incoming dependents, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
