    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class lacks incoming links and has a small number of outgoing links, so it does not qualify as a hub."
