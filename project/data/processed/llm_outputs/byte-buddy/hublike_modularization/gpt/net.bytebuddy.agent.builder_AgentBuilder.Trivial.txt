    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Trivial has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing links to many other abstractions; AgentBuilder.Trivial does not meet this criterion. Note: although AgentBuilder (the incoming peer) depends on many types, AgentBuilder.Trivial itself has no outgoing dependencies and is referenced only by AgentBuilder."
