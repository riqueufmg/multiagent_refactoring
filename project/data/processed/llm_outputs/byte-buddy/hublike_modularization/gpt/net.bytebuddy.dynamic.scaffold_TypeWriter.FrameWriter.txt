    "justification": "FrameWriter has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter). Although TypeWriter depends on many abstractions, FrameWriter itself is not connected to a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
