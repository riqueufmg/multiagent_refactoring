    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForJavaConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing is small, so it does not meet the smell criteria. Note: although the outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, the analysis of this class in isolation shows it is not a hub."
