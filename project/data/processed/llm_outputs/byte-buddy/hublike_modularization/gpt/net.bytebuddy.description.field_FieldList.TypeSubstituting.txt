    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has no incoming dependencies and only two direct outgoing dependencies; therefore it does not qualify as hub-like. (Note: the many dependencies of TypeDescription are indirect and, per the isolation constraint, do not make this class a hub.)"
