    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.RenamingPlugin, and only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; with counts of 1 incoming and 1 outgoing, this class does not meet that criterion."
