    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.StubInvocationBenchmark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StubInvocationBenchmark has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.benchmark.ClassByImplementationBenchmark, net.bytebuddy.benchmark.specimen.ExampleInterface) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although one outgoing target (ClassByImplementationBenchmark) itself depends on many classes, the analysis must treat StubInvocationBenchmark in isolation — it does not exhibit a high fan-in or fan-out and therefore is not a hub."
