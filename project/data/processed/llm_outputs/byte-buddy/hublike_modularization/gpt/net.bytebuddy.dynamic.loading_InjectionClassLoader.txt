    "justification": "Not detected: InjectionClassLoader has 0 outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only 3 incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Unloaded, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Default). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing dependencies are absent and incoming references are limited to the three classes listed, so the criteria are not met."
