    "justification": "Not detected as Hub-like Modularization: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). A hub-like smell requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criteria."
