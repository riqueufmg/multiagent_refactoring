    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Outgoing dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; here the counts are small, so Advice.NoOp is not a hub."
