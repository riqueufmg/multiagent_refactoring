    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution) and four outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; with 1 incoming and 4 outgoing dependencies this class does not exhibit a hub-like coupling pattern."
