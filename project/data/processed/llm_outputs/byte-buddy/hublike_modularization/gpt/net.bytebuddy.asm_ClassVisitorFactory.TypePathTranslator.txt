    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory). Although those target classes themselves have many dependencies, TypePathTranslator itself does not exhibit many incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
