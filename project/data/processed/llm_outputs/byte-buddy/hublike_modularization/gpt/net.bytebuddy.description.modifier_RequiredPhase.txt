    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.RequiredPhase",

    "justification": "RequiredPhase has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor) and 2 incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable and net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; the provided data shows low counts of distinct incoming/outgoing dependencies, so this class is not a hub. (Note: the incoming classes reference many other modifier types, but that reflects those classes' dependencies, not many direct couplings of RequiredPhase itself.)"
