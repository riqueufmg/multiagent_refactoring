    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 5 targets [net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication]. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although some outgoing targets themselves reference many types, the analyzed class has no incoming couplings and only five outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
