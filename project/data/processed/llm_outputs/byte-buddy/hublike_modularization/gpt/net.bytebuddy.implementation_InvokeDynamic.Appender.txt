    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation), so it does not meet the hub-like criterion when considered in isolation."
