    "justification": "The class has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here, incoming dependencies = 0 and outgoing dependencies = 2, which is not a large number; therefore it is not a hub."
