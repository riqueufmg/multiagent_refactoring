Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The provided data shows UsingReflection has only a single incoming and a single outgoing dependency. (Note: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector itself has many dependencies, but those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of UsingReflection in the provided data.)"
