    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here there are no incoming dependencies, so the smell is not present."
