    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation does not: incoming = 0, outgoing = 1, so it does not qualify as a hub."
