    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Adapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (33 different abstractions, e.g. net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription), but it has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; because this class lacks incoming dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
