    "justification": "Not detected: the analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships. Although the outgoing target (ParameterList) itself depends on many classes, those are not direct incoming/outgoing dependencies of the analyzed class in the provided data."
