    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.FieldGetter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Implementation.FieldGetter has multiple outgoing dependencies (ParameterDescription, ParameterList, AnnotationList, FieldDescription, TypeList, TypeDescription, AnnotationValue) and those target types have many further collaborators, but there are no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; since incoming dependencies are absent, this class does not qualify as a hub."
