    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although MethodDescription has many dependencies itself, the analysis must consider the class in isolation, and this class does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions."
