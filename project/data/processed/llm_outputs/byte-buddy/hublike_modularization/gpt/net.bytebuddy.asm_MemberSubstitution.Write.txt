    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Write",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and 6 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList). Because there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing dependency count is modest, it does not meet the hub-like modularization smell."
