    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are empty (no outgoing edges). Incoming dependencies are limited to a single class: net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool. Although that incoming class (TypePool) has many dependencies, the analyzed class itself has only one incoming dependency and zero outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (no large fan-in and fan-out for this abstraction)."
