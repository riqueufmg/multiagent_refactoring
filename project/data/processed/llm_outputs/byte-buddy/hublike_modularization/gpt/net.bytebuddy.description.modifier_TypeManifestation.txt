    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeManifestation has many incoming dependencies (is referenced by multiple distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder; net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaInstrumentationStrategy; net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaInstanceFactory; net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy; net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable; net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase), but it has only a single direct outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and a large number of outgoing dependencies. Because TypeManifestation's outgoing coupling is minimal (1 direct dependency), it does not qualify as hub-like modularization."
