    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.MethodCallProxy.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to five abstractions: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodReturn, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and it has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because this class has no incoming dependencies and only a moderate number (5) of outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the hub-like modularization criteria."
