    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming links and has only a small number of outgoing links, so it is not a hub."
