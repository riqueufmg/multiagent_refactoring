    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []), and only four outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter. Although those outgoing classes themselves have numerous dependencies, the lack of incoming couplings means this class does not act as a hub."
