    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.BootLoaderProxyCreationAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has only one incoming abstraction (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) and only one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy). A hub-like modularization would require many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although ClassFileLocator references many other types and ClassLoadingStrategy itself has multiple dependencies, the BootLoaderProxyCreationAction class itself interacts directly with only one incoming and one outgoing abstraction, so it does not qualify as hub-like."
