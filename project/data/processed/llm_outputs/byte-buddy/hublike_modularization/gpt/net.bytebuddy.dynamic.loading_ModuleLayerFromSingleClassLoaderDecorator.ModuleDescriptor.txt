    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.ModuleDescriptor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one recorded incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator) and only one recorded outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; these counts are minimal, so the smell is not present."
