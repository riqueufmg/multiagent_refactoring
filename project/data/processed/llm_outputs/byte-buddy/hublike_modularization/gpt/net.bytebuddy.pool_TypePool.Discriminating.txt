    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and 0 incoming dependencies. A hub-like modularization requires dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class only references a single external abstraction and has no incoming links, so it does not meet the smell criteria."
