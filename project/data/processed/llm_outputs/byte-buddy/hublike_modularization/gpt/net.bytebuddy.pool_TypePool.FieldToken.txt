    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing links; the provided data shows a very small number of dependencies (outgoing count = 1, incoming count = 0), so this class is not a hub."
