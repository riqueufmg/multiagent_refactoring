    "justification": "ShiftRight has 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ShiftRight.Unsigned) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; because there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing set is small, the hub-like smell is not detected."
