    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.Resolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct relations: 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here both counts are low, so the smell is not present. Note: although the referenced classes themselves list many dependencies, the provided data shows only three direct outgoing dependencies and one direct incoming dependency for this class."
