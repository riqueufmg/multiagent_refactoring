    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForMatchedGrouping",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No. The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing ties; this class lacks incoming ties and has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (3), so it does not qualify as a hub."
