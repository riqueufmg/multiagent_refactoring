    "justification": "FieldLocator is referenced by a very large number of other classes (59 distinct incoming dependents, e.g. net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution, net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall, net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor, net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder, etc.), but it has a small set of direct outgoing dependencies (6 direct dependencies: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.Illegal, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.Resolution, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; FieldLocator exhibits many incoming links but not a comparably large number of outgoing links, so the smell is not detected."
