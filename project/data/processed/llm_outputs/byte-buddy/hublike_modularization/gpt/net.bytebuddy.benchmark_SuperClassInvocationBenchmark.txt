    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only outgoing dependencies to 2 other abstractions (net.bytebuddy.benchmark.ClassByExtensionBenchmark, net.bytebuddy.benchmark.specimen.ExampleClass) and has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships, which is not present here."
