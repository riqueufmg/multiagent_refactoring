    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 2 other abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion based on the provided data."
