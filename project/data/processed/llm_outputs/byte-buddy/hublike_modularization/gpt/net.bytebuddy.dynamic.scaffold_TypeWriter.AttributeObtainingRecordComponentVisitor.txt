    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks a significant number on either side, so it is not a hub."
