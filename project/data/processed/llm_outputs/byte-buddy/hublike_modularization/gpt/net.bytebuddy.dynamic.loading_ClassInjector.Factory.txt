    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.Factory",

    "justification": "The class has 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.PackageDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Given the absence of incoming dependencies and only a small number (4) of outgoing dependencies, this class does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
