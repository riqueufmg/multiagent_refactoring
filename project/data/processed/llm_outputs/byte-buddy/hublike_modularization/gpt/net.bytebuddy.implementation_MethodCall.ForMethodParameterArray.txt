    "justification": "The class has a limited set of connections: 6 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a high number of incoming links and its outgoing links are moderate, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
