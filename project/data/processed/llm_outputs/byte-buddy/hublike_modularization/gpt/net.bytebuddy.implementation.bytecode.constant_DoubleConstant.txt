    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.DoubleConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DoubleConstant has a small number of outgoing dependencies (4): net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation. It has a single incoming dependency (1) from net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.DefaultValue (which itself depends on several constants including DoubleConstant). Because both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are low and there is only one incoming client, the class does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell (no large number of incoming and outgoing relationships)."
