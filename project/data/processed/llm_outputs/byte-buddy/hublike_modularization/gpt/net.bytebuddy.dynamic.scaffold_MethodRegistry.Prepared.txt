    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are numerous (12 distinct abstractions: MethodAttributeAppender, Visibility, TypeInitializer, MethodGraph, MethodDescription, LoadedTypeInitializer, MethodList, ClassFileVersion, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation, TypeDescription, MethodRegistry). Incoming dependencies are minimal (only 1 recorded incoming abstraction: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here Prepared has many outgoing but only a single incoming dependency, so it does not meet the hub-like modularization criterion."
