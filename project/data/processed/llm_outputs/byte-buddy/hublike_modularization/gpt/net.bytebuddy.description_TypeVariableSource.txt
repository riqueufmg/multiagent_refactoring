    "justification": "TypeVariableSource exhibits hub-like modularization because it has outgoing dependencies to multiple abstractions (MethodDescription, TypeVariableSource.Visitor, TypeList, TypeDescription, ModifierReviewable) and is depended upon by a large number of other abstractions. Specifically, 38 distinct incoming dependents (including many net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.* variants such as TypePool, TypePool.Default, TypePool.LazyTypeDescription, TypePool.ForTypeVariable, TypePool.TokenizedGenericType, etc.; numerous type-related classes such as net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and its nested/related classes, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList and its variants; and method-related classes such as net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and MethodDescription.AbstractBase) reference TypeVariableSource. The combination of multiple outgoing ties and a very large set of incoming dependents (≈38) indicates a hub-like coupling pattern centered on this abstraction."
