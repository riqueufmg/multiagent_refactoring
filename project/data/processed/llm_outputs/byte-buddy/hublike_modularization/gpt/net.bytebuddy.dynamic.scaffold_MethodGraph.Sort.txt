    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; here Sort lacks outgoing dependencies and has only one incoming reference, so it does not qualify."
