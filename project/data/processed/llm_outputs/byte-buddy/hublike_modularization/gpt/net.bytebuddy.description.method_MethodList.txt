    "justification": "MethodList has a large number of incoming dependencies (≈43 distinct dependents in the provided data, e.g. net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.*). However, its outgoing (direct) dependencies are limited to 7 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.MethodComparator, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstructorComparator, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Because Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies, and MethodList exhibits many incoming but only a small number of outgoing dependencies in the provided data, the smell is not detected."
