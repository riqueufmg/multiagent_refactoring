    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList.Executable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ParameterList.Executable has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList) and one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides. Although JavaDispatcher (the single outgoing dependency) itself depends on many classes, those are not direct dependencies of ParameterList.Executable per the provided data. Therefore the class does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
