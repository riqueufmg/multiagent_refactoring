    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.DexProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here incoming_count=1 and outgoing_count=0, so the class is not a hub. Note: the incoming class lists many dependencies, but those are dependencies of AndroidClassLoadingStrategy, not of DexProcessor itself."
