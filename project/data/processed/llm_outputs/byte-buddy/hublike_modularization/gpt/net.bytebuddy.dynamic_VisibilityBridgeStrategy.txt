    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.VisibilityBridgeStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has many incoming dependencies (13 distinct classes in the provided data reference net.bytebuddy.dynamic.VisibilityBridgeStrategy, e.g. net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Builder, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, etc.), but it has only a single direct outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and a large number of outgoing dependencies. Although MethodDescription (the single outgoing target) itself has many dependencies, VisibilityBridgeStrategy directly depends on only one other abstraction, so the hub-like smell is not present."
