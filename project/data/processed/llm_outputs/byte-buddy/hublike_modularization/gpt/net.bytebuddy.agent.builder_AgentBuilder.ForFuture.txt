    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForFuture",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.ForFuture has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. While net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself lists many dependencies, those are indirect and belong to that dependency, not to AgentBuilder.ForFuture when analyzed in isolation, so the class is not a hub."
