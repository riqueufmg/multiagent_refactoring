    "justification": "ArrayAccess has 6 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition; net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation; net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize; net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin; net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation; net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication) and 4 incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder; Binder.Appender; Binder.RedirectionProxy; Binder.MethodCall), totalling 10 distinct direct relationships. Many of these relationships are to central/core abstractions (Implementation, StackManipulation, TypeDefinition, Duplication) and ArrayAccess is referenced by multiple binder-related classes, indicating it serves as a focal point connecting several otherwise independent components. This concentration of both incoming and outgoing links matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
