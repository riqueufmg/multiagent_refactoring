    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only a small set of outgoing dependencies (4 distinct targets: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and has only a few outgoing links, so the smell is not present."
