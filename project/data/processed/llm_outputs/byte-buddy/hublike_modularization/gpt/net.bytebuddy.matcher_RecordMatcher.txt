    "justification": "RecordMatcher has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and zero incoming dependencies. Although one of its outgoing targets (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself depends on many abstractions, RecordMatcher does not show a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
