    "justification": "SetAccessibleAction has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the class does not exhibit many direct incoming or outgoing links. (The listed many dependencies belong to the outgoing target but are not direct incoming/outgoing links of SetAccessibleAction.)"
