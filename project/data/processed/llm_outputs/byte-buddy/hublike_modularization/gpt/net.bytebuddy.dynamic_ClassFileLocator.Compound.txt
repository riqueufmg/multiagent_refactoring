    "justification": "ClassFileLocator.Compound has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of ClassFileLocator.Compound, so the class is not a hub."
