    "justification": "AsmClassWriter has a large number of outgoing dependencies (15) including: net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.Default, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.Factory, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.SuperClassResolvingJdkClassWriter, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.EmptyAsmClassReader, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.ForClassFileApi, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.JdkClassWriter, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher. It is also referenced by a large number of other abstractions (19 incoming references) across core components such as net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Builder, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.ClassWriterStrategy (and its variants), net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter (and many variants), multiple inline/rebase/redefinition dynamic type builders, and net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy. The combination of many distinct incoming clients and many outgoing collaborators indicates AsmClassWriter acts as a hub between numerous modules, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
