    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many dependencies both incoming and outgoing. This class has outgoing dependencies to 7 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveBoxingDelegate, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveWideningDelegate) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Because it lacks incoming coupling from other abstractions, it does not meet the bidirectional dependency characteristic of a hub, so Hub-like Modularization is not detected."
