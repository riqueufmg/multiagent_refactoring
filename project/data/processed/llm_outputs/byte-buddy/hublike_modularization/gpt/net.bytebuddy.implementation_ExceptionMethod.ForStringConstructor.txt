    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to five abstractions (MethodDescription, StackManipulation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, Duplication) but has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Given the absence of incoming dependencies and a modest number (5) of outgoing dependencies, this class does not meet the hub-like modularization smell criteria."
