    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationSource, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming_dependencies = [] and outgoing count = 2, which is not a large number."
