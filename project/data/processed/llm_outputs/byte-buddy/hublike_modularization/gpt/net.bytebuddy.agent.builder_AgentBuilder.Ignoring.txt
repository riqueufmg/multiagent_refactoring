    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; those conditions are not met. (Note: the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin has many dependencies, but AgentBuilder.Ignoring itself does not exhibit many incoming/outgoing links.)"
