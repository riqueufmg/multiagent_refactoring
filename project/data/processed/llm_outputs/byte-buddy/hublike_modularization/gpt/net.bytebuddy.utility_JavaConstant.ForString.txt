    "justification": "JavaConstant.ForString has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion. (Note: while the referenced TypeDescription lists many dependencies, the analysis is limited to the class in isolation.)"
