    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of dependencies in isolation: outgoing dependencies are only 2 classes (net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.RecordComponentAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList) and there is a single incoming dependency listed (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; the provided data shows low fan-in and low fan-out for this class, so the smell is not detected."
