    "justification": "The class has many outgoing dependencies (15 distinct abstractions, e.g. net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, etc.) but has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because incoming dependencies are absent, the condition for this smell is not met."
