    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). These direct incoming/outgoing coupling counts are low and do not indicate an abstraction acting as a hub. (While the referenced outgoing classes themselves list many dependencies, the smell is evaluated on the analyzed class's own incoming/outgoing relationships.)"
