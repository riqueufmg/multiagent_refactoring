    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Transformer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Transformer has many outgoing dependencies (Assigner, LatentMatcher, ClassFileLocator, LoadedTypeInitializer, Plugin, DynamicType, Advice, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AsmVisitorWrapper, TypeDescription — 10 distinct outgoing abstractions) but only a single incoming dependency listed (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires both high incoming and high outgoing coupling; here incoming coupling is low (1), so the class is not a hub."
