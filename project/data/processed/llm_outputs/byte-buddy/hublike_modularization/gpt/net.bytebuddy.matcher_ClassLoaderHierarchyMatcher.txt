    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. Incoming dependencies = 0 (no classes depend on it). Outgoing dependencies = 2: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing relationships; here incoming is empty and outgoing is very small, so the smell is not present."
