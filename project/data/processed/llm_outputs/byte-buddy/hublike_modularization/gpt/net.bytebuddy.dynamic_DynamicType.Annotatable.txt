    "justification": "Direct outgoing dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList). Direct incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). The analyzed class has only one direct supplier and one direct client in the provided data. Although AnnotationList (the outgoing dependency) references many types, those are indirect (second-degree) dependencies and are not direct incoming/outgoing ties for DynamicType.Annotatable in the given data. Therefore the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization based on the provided dependency set."
