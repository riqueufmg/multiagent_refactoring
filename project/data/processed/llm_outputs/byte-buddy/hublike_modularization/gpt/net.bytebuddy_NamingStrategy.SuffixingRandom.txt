    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.RandomString). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections. Although HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin (one outgoing) has many internal dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies."
