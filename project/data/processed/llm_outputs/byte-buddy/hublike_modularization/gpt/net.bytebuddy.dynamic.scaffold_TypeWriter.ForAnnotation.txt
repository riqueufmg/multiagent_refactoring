    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForAnnotation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one recorded outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and only one recorded incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter). Although the outgoing target MethodDescription itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of TypeWriter.ForAnnotation in the provided data. Because the analyzed class has a single incoming and a single outgoing dependency rather than dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
