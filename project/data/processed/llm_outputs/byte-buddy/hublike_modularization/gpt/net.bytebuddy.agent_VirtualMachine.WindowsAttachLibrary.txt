    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine). Although VirtualMachine lists many related classes, the analyzed class itself is referenced by only one abstraction and does not have both numerous incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
