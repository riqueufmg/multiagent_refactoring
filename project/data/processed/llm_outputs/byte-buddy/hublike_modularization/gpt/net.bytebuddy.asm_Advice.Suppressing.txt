    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has only outgoing dependencies to four abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and no incoming dependencies. The smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here incoming count = 0 and outgoing count = 4, which does not meet the hub-like criteria."
