Direct outgoing dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit that (only one incoming and three outgoing)."
