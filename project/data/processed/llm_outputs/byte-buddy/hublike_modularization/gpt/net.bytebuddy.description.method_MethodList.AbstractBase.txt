    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty), so it is not depended upon by many other abstractions. It has only three direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement), which is not a large number of partners. Although MethodDescription lists many of its own dependencies, that is transitive and the analysis must consider the class in isolation. Therefore it does not meet the hub-like modularization criteria (requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
