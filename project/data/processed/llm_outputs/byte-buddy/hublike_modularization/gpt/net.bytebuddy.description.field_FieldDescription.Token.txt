    "justification": "FieldDescription.Token has 0 incoming dependencies and 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Because incoming_dependencies is empty and the class only directly depends on four other abstractions, it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
