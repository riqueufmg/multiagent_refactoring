    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although TypeDescription (the single outgoing dependency) itself is highly connected, the analyzed class is not — it lacks numerous incoming or outgoing relationships."
