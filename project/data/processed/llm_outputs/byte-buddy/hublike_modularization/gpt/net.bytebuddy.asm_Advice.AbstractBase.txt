    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and 5 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming links (and only five outgoing targets in the provided data) prevents this class from qualifying as a hub in isolation."
