    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Note: although AndroidClassLoadingStrategy depends on many classes, that reflects the caller's connections, not many distinct incoming/outgoing ties for Dispatcher itself."
