    "justification": "The Token abstraction has outgoing dependencies to five other abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It has a single incoming dependency recorded (from net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription). The total number of distinct coupled abstractions is five (RecordComponentDescription appears as both incoming and outgoing). This is a small, localized set of dependencies and does not constitute a hub-like module with many incoming and outgoing connections."
