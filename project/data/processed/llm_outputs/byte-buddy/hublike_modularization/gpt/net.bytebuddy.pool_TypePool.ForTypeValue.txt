Outgoing dependencies = 3 (net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only three outgoing links, so it does not meet the hub-like smell criteria."
