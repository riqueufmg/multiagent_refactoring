    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByExtensionBenchmark_jmhType) and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion based on the provided data."
