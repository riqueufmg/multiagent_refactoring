    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RenamingPlugin.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class net.bytebuddy.build.RenamingPlugin.Compound has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and zero incoming dependencies. While net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself lists many dependencies, those are not incoming/outgoing relations of RenamingPlugin.Compound. Therefore RenamingPlugin.Compound does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
