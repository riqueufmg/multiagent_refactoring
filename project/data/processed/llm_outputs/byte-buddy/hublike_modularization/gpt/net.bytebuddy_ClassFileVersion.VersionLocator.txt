    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion) and a single direct incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion). These low counts of incoming and outgoing relationships do not indicate a hub-like modularization. (Analysis limited to the provided direct dependencies; transitive/deeper dependency lists of related classes are not counted.)"
