    "justification": "The analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although that outgoing dependency itself references many classes, Advice.ForLabel does not have a large number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
