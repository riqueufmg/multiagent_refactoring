    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies = 0; Incoming dependencies = 1 (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and/or outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although AgentBuilder (the single incoming class) lists many dependencies, AgentBuilder.Inactive itself only participates in a single incoming relationship and has no outgoing relationships, so it does not qualify as a hub."
