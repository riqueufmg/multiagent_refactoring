    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.RecordComponentExtractor has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although OpenedClassReader itself depends on three other classes, those are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class and the analysis is done in isolation, so the class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
