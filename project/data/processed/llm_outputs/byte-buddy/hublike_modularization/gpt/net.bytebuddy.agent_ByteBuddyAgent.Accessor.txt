    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only 1 incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here Accessor lacks outgoing links and is referenced by a single class, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
