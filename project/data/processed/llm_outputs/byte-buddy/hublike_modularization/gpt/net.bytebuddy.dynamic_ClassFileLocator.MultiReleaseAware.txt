    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and a single incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of distinct abstractions; the provided data does not show many incoming or outgoing relationships for this class."
