    "justification": "Not detected: the analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have numerous incoming and outgoing connections. Although the outgoing dependency ClassFileLocator lists many dependencies itself, those are not direct dependencies of this class and the analysis is limited to the class in isolation."
