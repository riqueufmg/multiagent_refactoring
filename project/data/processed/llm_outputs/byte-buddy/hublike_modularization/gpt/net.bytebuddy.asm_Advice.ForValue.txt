    "justification": "Not detected: net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForValue has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of distinct abstractions; the provided data shows low incoming/outgoing counts for this class."
