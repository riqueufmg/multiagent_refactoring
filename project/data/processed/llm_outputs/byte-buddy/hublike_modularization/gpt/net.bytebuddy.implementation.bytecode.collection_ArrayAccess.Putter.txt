    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only three outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit the smell."
