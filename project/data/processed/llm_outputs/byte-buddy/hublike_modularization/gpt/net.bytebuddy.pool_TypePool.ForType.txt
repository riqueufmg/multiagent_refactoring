    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList). Incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. In isolation, ForType has a low fan-in (1) and low fan-out (2). Although the outgoing targets themselves list many transitive dependencies, the analysis constraint is to consider the class in isolation; therefore ForType is not a hub."
