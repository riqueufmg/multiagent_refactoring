    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to two abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, and has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
