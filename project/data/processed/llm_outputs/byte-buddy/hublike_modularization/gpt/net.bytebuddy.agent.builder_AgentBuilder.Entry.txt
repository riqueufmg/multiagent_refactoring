    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Entry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Entry has only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). While the outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation shows a small number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships, so it does not act as a hub with a large number of dependencies."
