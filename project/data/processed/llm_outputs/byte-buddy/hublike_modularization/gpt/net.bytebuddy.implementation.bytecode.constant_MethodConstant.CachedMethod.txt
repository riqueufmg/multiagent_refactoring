    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) as listed in analyzed_package.dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have numerous incoming and outgoing connections. Although the three outgoing targets themselves reference many other types, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies by itself, so it is not a hub."
