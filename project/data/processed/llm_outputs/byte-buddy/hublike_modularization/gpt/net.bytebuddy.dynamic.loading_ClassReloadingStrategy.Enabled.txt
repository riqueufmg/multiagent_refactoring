    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy.Enabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies and only two direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Although the two referenced classes themselves have many dependencies (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin → 17 deps; ClassInjector → 26 deps), the analyzed class itself is connected to only 2 other abstractions and thus does not meet the 'hub-like' criterion."
