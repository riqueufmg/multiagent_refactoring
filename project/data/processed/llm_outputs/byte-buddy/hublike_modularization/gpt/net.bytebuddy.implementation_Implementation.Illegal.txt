{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Illegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Implementation.Illegal has only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Because the class has a very small number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships, it does not meet the criterion of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions and therefore is not a hub-like modularization."
