    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription). Neither the incoming nor the outgoing dependency count is large, so this class is not a hub."
