    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.Unavailable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires the class to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent). Although ByteBuddyAgent depends on many other classes, ByteBuddyAgent.Unavailable itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming and outgoing links, so it is not a hub."
