    "justification": "The class has a small number of connections: incoming from 1 abstraction (net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription) and outgoing to 2 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin), for a total of 3 distinct related abstractions. This does not meet the definition of Hub-like Modularization, which requires dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions."
