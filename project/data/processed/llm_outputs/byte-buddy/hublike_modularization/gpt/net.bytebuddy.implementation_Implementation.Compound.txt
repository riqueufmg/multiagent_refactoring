    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Implementation.Compound has a small number of direct connections: outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) and a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. There is no evidence of a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies for this class in the provided data, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
