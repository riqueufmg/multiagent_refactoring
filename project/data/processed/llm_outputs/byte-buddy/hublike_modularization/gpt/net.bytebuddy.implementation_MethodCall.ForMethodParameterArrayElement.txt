    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited to 5 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. Incoming dependencies are from a single abstraction: net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall (which references ForMethodParameterArrayElement). Because the class has only one incoming partner and a small set (5) of outgoing partners, it does not exhibit a hub-like pattern of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
