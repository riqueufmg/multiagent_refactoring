    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. While AgentBuilder (the single outgoing) itself depends on many types, that does not make this class have many direct incoming/outgoing links."
