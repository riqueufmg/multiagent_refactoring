    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct relationships: 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender) and 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion based on the provided dependency lists."
