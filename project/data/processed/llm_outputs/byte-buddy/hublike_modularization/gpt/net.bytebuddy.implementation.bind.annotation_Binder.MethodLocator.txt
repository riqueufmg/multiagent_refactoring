    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.MethodLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Binder.MethodLocator has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder). There is no high fan-in or fan-out for this class itself; although the referenced classes list many internal dependencies, Binder.MethodLocator does not directly have a large number of incoming and outgoing abstraction dependencies required to qualify as hub-like modularization."
