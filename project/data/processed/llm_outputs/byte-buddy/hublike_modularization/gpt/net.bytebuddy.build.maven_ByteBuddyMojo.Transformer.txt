    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.Transformer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has only two direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin and net.bytebuddy.build.maven.Transformation) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo). Although the Plugin dependency itself references many other abstractions, the Transformer class itself is directly connected to only two other abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (no large number of both incoming and outgoing direct dependencies)."
