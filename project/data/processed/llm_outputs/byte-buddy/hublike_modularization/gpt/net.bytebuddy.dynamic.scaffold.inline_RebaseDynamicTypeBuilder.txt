    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. RebaseDynamicTypeBuilder has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) while it has a large number of outgoing dependencies (28 distinct outgoing dependencies, e.g. net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter). Because it lacks incoming dependencies, it does not meet the requirement of having both many incoming and outgoing links and therefore is not detected as a hub."
