    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter -> TypeWriter.Dispatcher) and only one direct outgoing dependency (TypeWriter.Dispatcher -> net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; both counts are low here. Note: while the outgoing target (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of TypeWriter.Dispatcher in the provided data."
