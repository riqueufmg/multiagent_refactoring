    "justification": "MethodNameEqualityResolver has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder) and is referenced by only 2 incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.AmbiguityResolver). The number of distinct incoming and outgoing connections is small, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
