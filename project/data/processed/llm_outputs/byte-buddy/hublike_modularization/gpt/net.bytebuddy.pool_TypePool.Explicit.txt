    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypePool.Explicit has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing relationships of TypePool.Explicit. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
