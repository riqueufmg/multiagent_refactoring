    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.OpenedClassRemapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. This class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader) and 0 incoming dependencies. The single outgoing target (OpenedClassReader) itself depends on three classes, but that does not make the analyzed class a hub because the analyzed class does not have multiple incoming and outgoing connections. Therefore it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
