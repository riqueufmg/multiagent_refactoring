    "justification": "The class has only one direct outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, and only one direct incoming dependency: net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here both direct incoming and outgoing dependency counts are 1, so this class is not a hub."
