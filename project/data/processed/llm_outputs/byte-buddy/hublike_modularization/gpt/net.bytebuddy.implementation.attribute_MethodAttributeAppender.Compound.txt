    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 outgoing dependencies (to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender). Although one outgoing target (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself depends on many types, that does not increase the analyzed class's direct incoming/outgoing coupling. Therefore the class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
