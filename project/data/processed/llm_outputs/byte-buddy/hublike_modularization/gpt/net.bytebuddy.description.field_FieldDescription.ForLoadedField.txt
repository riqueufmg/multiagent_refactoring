    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList). While one of those targets (TypeDescription) lists many of its own dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
