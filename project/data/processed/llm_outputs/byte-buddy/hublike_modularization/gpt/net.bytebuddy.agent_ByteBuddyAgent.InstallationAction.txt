It has a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent (incoming_dependencies contains only net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; InstallationAction does not exhibit many incoming or any outgoing dependencies."
