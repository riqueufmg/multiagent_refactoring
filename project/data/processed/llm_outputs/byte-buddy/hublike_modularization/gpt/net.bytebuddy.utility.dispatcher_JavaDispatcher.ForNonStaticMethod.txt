    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the single outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing relationships of the analyzed class per the provided data, so the class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
