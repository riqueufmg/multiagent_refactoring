    "detection": true,
    "justification": "TypeList has outgoing dependencies to many other abstractions (examples from its dependency list include: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeVariableToken, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList.Generic, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList.OfMethodExceptionTypes, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList.OfConstructorExceptionTypes, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList.OfLoadedInterfaceTypes). It also receives incoming dependencies from a large and diverse set of classes across many packages (representative incoming dependents include net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType and its Builder/AbstractBase variants, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter and many of its inner classes, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool and many of its nested types, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice and many MemberSubstitution variants, net.bytebuddy.implementation.* classes, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and ParameterList, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType/JavaConstant, and numerous other components). Because TypeList both depends on and is depended upon by a large number of distinct abstractions across the system (acting as a common connector used by many modules), it exhibits the Hub-like Modularization smell."
