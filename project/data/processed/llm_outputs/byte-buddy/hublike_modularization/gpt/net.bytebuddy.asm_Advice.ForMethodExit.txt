    "justification": "Advice.ForMethodExit has only 6 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and only a single incoming dependency listed (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections; the provided data shows low counts on both sides, so it is not a hub."
