    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassFilePostProcessor.ForClassFileTransformer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many of its own dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
