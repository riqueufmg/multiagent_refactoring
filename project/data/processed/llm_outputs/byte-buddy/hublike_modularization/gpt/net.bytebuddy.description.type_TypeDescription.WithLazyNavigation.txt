    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization is not detected because the class has a small number of direct relationships: 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). A hub-like smell requires many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit that pattern based on the provided data."
