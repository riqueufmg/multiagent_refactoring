    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.ForConfiguredPlugin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin and net.bytebuddy.build.maven.Transformation. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. Although net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin itself lists many dependencies, those are outgoing from Plugin (shown in outgoing_dependencies) and do not make ByteBuddyMojo.ForConfiguredPlugin a hub. Therefore the hub-like smell is not detected for this class."
