    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low incoming and outgoing counts. Note: the long dependency list shown under the outgoing_dependencies entry belongs to the Implementation class, not to Dispatcher itself."
