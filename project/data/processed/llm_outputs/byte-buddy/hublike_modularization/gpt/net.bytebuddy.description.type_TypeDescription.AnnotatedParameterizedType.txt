    "justification": "The class has only one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and only one direct incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here both counts are low, so the smell is not detected. (Note: JavaDispatcher itself depends on many classes, but those are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class.)"
