    "justification": "Plugin.ForJarEntry has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships. In isolation, this class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
