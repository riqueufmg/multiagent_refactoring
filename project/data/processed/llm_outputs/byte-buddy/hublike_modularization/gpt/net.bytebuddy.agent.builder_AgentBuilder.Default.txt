    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Default exhibits a high fan-out (22 outgoing dependencies — e.g. ResettableClassFileTransformer, TypePool, JavaType, ClassLoadingStrategy, DynamicType, ByteBuddy, etc.), but it has only a single incoming dependency in the provided data (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Because the incoming dependency count is low (1) despite the high outgoing count, the smell is not detected."
