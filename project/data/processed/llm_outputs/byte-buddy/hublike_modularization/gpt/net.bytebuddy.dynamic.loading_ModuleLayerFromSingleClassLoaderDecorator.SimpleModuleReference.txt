    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions (Assigner, Visibility, DynamicType, ConstructorStrategy, JavaDispatcher, FieldManifestation) but only a single incoming dependency entry (referenced by net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here the incoming degree is low (1) despite a moderate outgoing degree (6), so it does not qualify as a hub."
