    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.FrameComputingClassWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []), and only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Although those two referenced classes have large internal dependency lists, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit both many incoming and many outgoing connections required for Hub-like Modularization (incoming count = 0, outgoing count = 2). Therefore the smell is not detected."
