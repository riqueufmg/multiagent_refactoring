    "justification": "JavaConstant.ForKind has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant) and one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. While the outgoing dependency JavaDispatcher itself depends on many classes, those are not listed as direct dependencies of JavaConstant.ForKind and the analysis considers the class in isolation, so the class is not a hub."
