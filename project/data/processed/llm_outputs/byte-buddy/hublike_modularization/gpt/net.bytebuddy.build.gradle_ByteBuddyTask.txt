    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ByteBuddyTask has a small number of direct incoming and outgoing dependencies. Direct outgoing dependencies (from the provided data) are: net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin, net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.IncrementalResolver, org.gradle.work.InputChanges, and org.gradle.api.tasks.PathSensitivity (4). Direct incoming dependencies are: net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTaskConfiguration and net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTaskExtension (2). Although net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin itself references many types, those are transitive dependencies of Plugin, not direct dependencies of ByteBuddyTask. Given the low counts of direct incoming (2) and outgoing (4) relationships in the provided data, the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
