    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaInstanceFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (18 distinct types, e.g. net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant), it has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections; the absence of incoming dependencies means this class is not a hub."
