    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.FieldNameExtractor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one recorded incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor) and one recorded outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The direct counts here are low (1 incoming, 1 outgoing). Although the outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of FieldAccessor.FieldNameExtractor and per the isolation constraint should not be attributed to this class. Therefore this class is not a hub."
