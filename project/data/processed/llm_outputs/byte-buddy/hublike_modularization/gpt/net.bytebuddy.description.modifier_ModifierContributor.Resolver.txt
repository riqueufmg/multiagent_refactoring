    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor.Resolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself references many other types, the analyzed class directly depends on only a single other abstraction and has no incoming dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
