    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Source",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited set of outgoing dependencies (5): net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It has a single incoming dependency entry (1) from net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin (Plugin references Plugin.Source). Because the class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships (only 5 outgoing and 1 incoming in the provided data), it does not qualify as a hub-like modularization."
