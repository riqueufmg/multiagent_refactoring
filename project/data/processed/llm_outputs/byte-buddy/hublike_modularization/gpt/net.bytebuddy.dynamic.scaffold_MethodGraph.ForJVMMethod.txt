    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.ForJVMMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one direct outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription (outgoing_dependencies contains a single entry). It has only one incoming dependency source: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph (incoming_dependencies contains a single entry). Because both the number of incoming dependents (1: MethodGraph) and outgoing dependencies (1: MethodDescription) are small, this class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. Note: MethodDescription itself references many types, but those are not direct dependencies of ForJVMMethod and thus do not make ForJVMMethod a hub when analyzed in isolation."
