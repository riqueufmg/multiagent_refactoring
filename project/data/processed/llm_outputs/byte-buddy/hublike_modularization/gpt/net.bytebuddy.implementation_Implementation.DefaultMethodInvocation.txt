    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.DefaultMethodInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct connections: 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph) and 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Although the outgoing targets themselves list many internal dependencies, the analyzed class itself is directly coupled to only three other abstractions in the provided data, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
