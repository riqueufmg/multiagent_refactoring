    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ClassLoaderParentMatcher has outgoing dependencies to only 2 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
