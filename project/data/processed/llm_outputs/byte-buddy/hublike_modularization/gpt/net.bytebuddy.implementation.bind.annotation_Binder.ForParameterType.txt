    "justification": "Binder.ForParameterType has only one direct outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription (from analyzed_package.dependencies). It has a single incoming dependency listed: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder (from incoming_dependencies). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; both counts are low here. Note that the outgoing_dependencies section shows many dependencies for TypeDescription, but those are dependencies of TypeDescription, not direct dependencies of Binder.ForParameterType; analysis is limited to the class in isolation."
