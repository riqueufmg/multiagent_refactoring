    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "This class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; the provided data shows neither many incoming nor many direct outgoing dependencies for this class (analysis is limited to the class in isolation), so the smell is not present."
