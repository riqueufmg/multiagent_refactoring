    "justification": "The class has 7 direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Several of these targets (notably TypeDescription and MethodDescription) transitively depend on many other abstractions, increasing its outgoing dependency surface. However, incoming_dependencies is empty (0 incoming dependencies). Hub-like Modularization requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; because this class has no incoming dependencies, the smell is not detected."
