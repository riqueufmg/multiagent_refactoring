    "justification": "MethodParameterTypeMatcher has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections. Given the class-in-isolation data provided (no incoming edges and only three direct outgoing dependencies), it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
