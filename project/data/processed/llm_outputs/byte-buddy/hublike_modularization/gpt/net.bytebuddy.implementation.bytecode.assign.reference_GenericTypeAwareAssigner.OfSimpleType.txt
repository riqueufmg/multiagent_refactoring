    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner.OfSimpleType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies (TypeList -> 11 listed dependencies; TypeDescription -> 57 listed dependencies), the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
