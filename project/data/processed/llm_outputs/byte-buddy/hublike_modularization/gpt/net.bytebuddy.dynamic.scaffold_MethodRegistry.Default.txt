    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although MethodRegistry.Default has a large number of outgoing dependencies (15 direct dependencies, e.g. net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender), it has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Because there are zero incoming dependencies, the class does not meet the definition of a hub and the smell is not detected."
