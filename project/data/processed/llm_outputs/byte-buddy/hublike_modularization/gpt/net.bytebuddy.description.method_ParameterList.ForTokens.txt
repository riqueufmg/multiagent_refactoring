    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ParameterList.ForTokens has only outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections. Although the two outgoing targets (MethodDescription and ParameterDescription) themselves reference many other types, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
