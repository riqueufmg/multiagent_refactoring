Outgoing dependencies: 2 (depends on net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. In isolation this class has few direct relationships (0 incoming, 2 outgoing), so the hub-like smell is not detected, even though its outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies."
