    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForFixedSize",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many of its own dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing relationships of AgentBuilder.ForFixedSize in the provided data, so the hub-like condition is not met."
