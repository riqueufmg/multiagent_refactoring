    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.ForClassHierarchy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to four abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator, and net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList. Its incoming dependencies list is empty (no other abstractions depend on it). Hub-like Modularization requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here there are no incoming dependencies and only four outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like smell criteria."
