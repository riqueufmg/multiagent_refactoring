    "justification": "The analyzed class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like Modularization is characterized by an abstraction having dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low fan-out (3) and low fan-in (1), so this class does not qualify as a hub."
