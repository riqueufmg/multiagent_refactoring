    "justification": "Not detected: VisibilityMatcher has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher. Although those outgoing dependencies themselves reference many types, VisibilityMatcher does not exhibit both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
