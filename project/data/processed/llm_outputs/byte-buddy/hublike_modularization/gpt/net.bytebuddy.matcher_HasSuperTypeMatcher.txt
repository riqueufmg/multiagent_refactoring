    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The provided data shows HasSuperTypeMatcher has 0 incoming dependencies and only 4 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Although some of those target classes themselves list many dependencies, HasSuperTypeMatcher's own direct coupling is small (0 incoming, 4 outgoing), so it does not meet the hub-like modularization criteria."
