    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. This class has many outgoing dependencies (17 distinct referenced abstractions such as net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, etc.) but zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Because it lacks the required large number of incoming dependencies, it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
