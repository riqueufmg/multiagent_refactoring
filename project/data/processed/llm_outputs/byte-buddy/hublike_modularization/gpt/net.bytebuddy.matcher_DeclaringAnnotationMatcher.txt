    "justification": "DeclaringAnnotationMatcher has only two direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing links, so the smell is not detected."
