    "justification": "Incoming dependencies are empty (incoming_dependencies = []). The class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many of its own dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing relationships of AgentBuilder.Conjunction in the provided data, so the class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
