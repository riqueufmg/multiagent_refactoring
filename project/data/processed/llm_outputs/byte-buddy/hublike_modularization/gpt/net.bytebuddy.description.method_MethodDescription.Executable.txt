    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships with many other abstractions; the provided data shows low fan-in and fan-out (1 incoming, 1 outgoing), so the smell is not present."
