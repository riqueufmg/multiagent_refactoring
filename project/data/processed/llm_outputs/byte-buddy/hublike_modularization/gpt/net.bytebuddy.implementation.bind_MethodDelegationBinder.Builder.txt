    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 4 explicit targets (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Although those outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin: 16, MethodDescription: 24, StackManipulation: 5, Implementation: 32), the analyzed class has no incoming links and only four outgoing links in the provided data. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires the abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; because incoming dependencies are absent and outgoing dependencies are not a large set in isolation, the smell is not detected."
