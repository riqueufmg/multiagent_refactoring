    "justification": "Incoming dependency count = 0 (no classes depend on this abstraction). Outgoing dependencies are limited to 5 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections; this class has no incoming dependencies and a small set of outgoing dependencies, so the hub-like smell is not present."
