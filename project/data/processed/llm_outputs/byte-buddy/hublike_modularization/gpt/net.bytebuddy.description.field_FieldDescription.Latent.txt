    "justification": "FieldDescription.Latent has only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. Although one outgoing dependency (TypeDescription) itself references many types, those are transitive dependencies of a dependency and, per the requirement to consider the class in isolation, do not make FieldDescription.Latent a hub."
