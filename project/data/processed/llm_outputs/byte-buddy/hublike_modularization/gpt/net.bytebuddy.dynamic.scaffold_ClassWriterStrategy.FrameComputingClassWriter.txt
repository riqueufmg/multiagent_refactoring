    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced AsmClassWriter itself lists many dependencies (e.g., AsmClassWriter.Default, AsmClassWriter.Factory, AsmClassWriter.SuperClassResolvingJdkClassWriter, AsmClassReader, ClassFileVersion, TypePool, etc.), the analyzed class in isolation only directly depends on a single abstraction and has no incoming dependencies, so it does not qualify as hub-like."
