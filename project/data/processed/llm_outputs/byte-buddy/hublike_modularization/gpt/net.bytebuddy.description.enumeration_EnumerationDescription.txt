    "justification": "EnumerationDescription has a large number of incoming dependencies (referenced by many classes such as net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution and its inner types, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant and JavaConstant.Dynamic, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool and several TypePool variants, net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall, net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue and related annotation/annotation-value classes, etc.), but its outgoing dependencies are only to two abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here the incoming side is large but the outgoing side is small, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
