    "justification": "DescriptorMatcher has 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.NamedElement, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; since there are no incoming dependencies and only three outgoing, this does not qualify as hub-like."
