    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "AnnotationList has a very large number of incoming dependencies from many distinct abstractions across multiple packages (examples include net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType and its inner types, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter and its nested types, many net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool variants, numerous net.bytebuddy.description.type.* classes, net.bytebuddy.description.method.* classes, net.bytebuddy.implementation.* classes, and more). At the same time it has outgoing dependencies to several central abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Those outgoing targets (notably TypeDescription and TypeList) are themselves highly connected (TypeDescription shows many dependencies), which reinforces AnnotationList's role as a connector/hub between many parts of the system. The combination of dozens of incoming dependents and dependencies on several central abstractions indicates the Hub-like Modularization smell."
