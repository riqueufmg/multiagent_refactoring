    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ReadWrite",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and therefore does not have both incoming and outgoing links required for a hub-like module. It has 6 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, Addition, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, Duplication, Removal). Although some of those outgoing dependencies (notably TypeDescription and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) themselves reference many other abstractions, the analyzed class lacks incoming couplings, so it does not meet the hub-like modularization condition."
