    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder.DefaultArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.BindingMechanic) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although the outgoing dependency (BindingMechanic) itself depends on multiple classes, the analyzed class itself has only a single outgoing and no incoming dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
