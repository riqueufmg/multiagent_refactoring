    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.TransformerDecorator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder) and only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer and net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependency relationships; the immediate fan-in (1) and fan-out (2) for this class are small. (While the two outgoing classes themselves list many dependencies, TransformerDecorator's direct coupling is limited to those two abstractions.)"
