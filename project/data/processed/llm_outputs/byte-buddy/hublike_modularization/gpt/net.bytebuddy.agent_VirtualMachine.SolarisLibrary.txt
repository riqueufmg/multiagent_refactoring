    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; SolarisLibrary does not meet that criterion based on the provided dependency data."
