    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (only net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent references it). Although ByteBuddyAgent itself lists many dependencies, Disabled is referenced by a single class and does not exhibit both many incoming and many outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
