    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaMethodImplementation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "False — AgentBuilder.LambdaMethodImplementation has outgoing dependencies to 8 other abstractions (Assigner, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, JavaConstant, FieldDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, Duplication) but has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires high connectivity in both incoming and outgoing directions; this class lacks incoming coupling and therefore does not qualify as a hub when analyzed in isolation."
