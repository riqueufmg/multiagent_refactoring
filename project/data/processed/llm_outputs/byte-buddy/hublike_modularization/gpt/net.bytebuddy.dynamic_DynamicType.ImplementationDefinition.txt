    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription) and only one incoming dependency entry (referenced by net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). Neither the number of distinct outgoing nor incoming relationships is large, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
