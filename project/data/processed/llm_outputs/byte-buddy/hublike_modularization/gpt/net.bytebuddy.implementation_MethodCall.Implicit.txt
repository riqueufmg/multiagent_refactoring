    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. The larger set of dependencies listed under the outgoing classes are dependencies of those classes, not direct incoming dependencies of the analyzed class (analysis is limited to the class in isolation)."
