    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentList) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; with outgoing_count=2 and incoming_count=0 (considering the class in isolation), this does not meet the hub-like criteria."
