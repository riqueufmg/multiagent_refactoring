    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Inactive",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Advice.Inactive has only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows low direct connectivity for Advice.Inactive. Note: the outgoing targets themselves depend on many types, but that does not make Advice.Inactive a hub based on its own incoming/outgoing counts."
