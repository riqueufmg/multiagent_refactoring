    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the incoming count is zero and the outgoing count is small, so it is not a hub."
