    "justification": "AgentBuilder.InstallationListener has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). The class itself is not directly connected to a large number of other abstractions, so it does not meet the hub-like modularization criteria. (While the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and AgentBuilder classes have many dependencies, those are not direct multiple incoming/outgoing links of InstallationListener.)"
