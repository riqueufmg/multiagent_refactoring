    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 11 distinct abstractions (Assigner; AnnotationDescription; TypeDefinition; MethodDescription; StackManipulation; ParameterDescription; JavaConstant; JavaType; HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin; TypeList; TypeDescription). Incoming dependencies: only 1 direct incoming abstraction (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; here outgoing is moderate but incoming is minimal, so the class is not a hub."
