    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy). Although the incoming class lists many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
