    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) and 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Addition). The smell requires many incoming and many outgoing relationships; the provided data shows low incoming (1) and a small number of outgoing (4), so it does not qualify as a hub."
