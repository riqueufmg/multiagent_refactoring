    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Eager has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. While the single outgoing dependency (TypePool) itself lists 66 dependent abstractions, AgentBuilder.Eager does not directly have many incoming or outgoing relationships in the provided data, so the hub-like smell is not detected for this class."
