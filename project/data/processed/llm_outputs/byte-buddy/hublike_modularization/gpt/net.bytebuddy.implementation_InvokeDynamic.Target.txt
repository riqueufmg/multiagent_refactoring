    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.Target",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to five abstractions: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It has a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic. Hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows limited fan-out (5) and minimal fan-in (1), so this class does not qualify as a hub."
