Outgoing dependencies: only 3 direct dependencies — net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has zero incoming and only three outgoing, so it is not a hub."
