    "justification": "TypePool.TokenList has 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. In the provided data the incoming dependency count is zero and the direct outgoing count is small (3), so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
