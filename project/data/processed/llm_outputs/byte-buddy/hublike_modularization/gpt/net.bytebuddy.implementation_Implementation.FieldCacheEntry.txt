Outgoing dependencies: 3 direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; this class has no incoming connections and only a small number of direct outgoing connections, so it is not a hub."
