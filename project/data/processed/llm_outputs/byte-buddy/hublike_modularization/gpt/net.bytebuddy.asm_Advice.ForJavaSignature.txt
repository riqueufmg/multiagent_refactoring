    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForJavaSignature",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (empty list) and only a single incoming dependency entry (from net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Although the Advice class lists many dependencies, ForJavaSignature itself is referenced by only one other abstraction and does not depend on many others. Under the isolation constraint, it does not exhibit both large incoming and outgoing coupling required for Hub-like Modularization."
