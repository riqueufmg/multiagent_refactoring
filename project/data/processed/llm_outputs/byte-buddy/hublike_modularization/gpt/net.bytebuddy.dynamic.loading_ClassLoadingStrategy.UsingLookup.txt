    "justification": "Not detected. The class has outgoing dependencies to three abstractions: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, and has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires both many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number of incoming dependencies (zero), so it is not a hub."
