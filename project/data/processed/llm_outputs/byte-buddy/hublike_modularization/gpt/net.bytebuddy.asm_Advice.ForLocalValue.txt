    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForLocalValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited to 6 direct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Incoming dependencies list only one direct incoming abstraction: net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections. Here the class has a modest number of outgoing links (6) and a single incoming link, and the outgoing links are cohesive (types/annotations/method/parameter/assigner concerns) rather than a wide set of unrelated modules. Therefore this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
