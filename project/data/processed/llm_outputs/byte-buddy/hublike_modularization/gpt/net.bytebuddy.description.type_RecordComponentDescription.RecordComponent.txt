    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription.RecordComponent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one recorded outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and one recorded incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription). The outgoing entry points to a single abstraction; although that abstraction (JavaDispatcher) references many other types, those are not direct dependencies of RecordComponent in the provided data. Therefore this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization (it lacks numerous distinct incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
