    "justification": "The class has a limited set of direct relationships: 6 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Although several of its outgoing targets themselves depend on many other types, MethodResolver itself does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming and outgoing abstraction links required for Hub-like Modularization."
