    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Delegator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 4 direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Although those referenced types themselves reference many other abstractions, the analyzed class does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships (incoming = 0), so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
