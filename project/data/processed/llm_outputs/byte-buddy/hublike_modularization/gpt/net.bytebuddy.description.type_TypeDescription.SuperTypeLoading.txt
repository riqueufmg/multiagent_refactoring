For this class the provided data shows 0 incoming dependencies and 6 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Because incoming dependencies are zero, the class does not meet the 'both incoming and outgoing with a large number of others' condition for a hub. Analysis is limited to the provided data."
