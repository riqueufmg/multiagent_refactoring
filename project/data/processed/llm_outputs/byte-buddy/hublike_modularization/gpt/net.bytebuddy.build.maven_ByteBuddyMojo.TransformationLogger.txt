    "justification": "TransformationLogger has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo) and one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; TransformationLogger does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies."
