    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. Although the single outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself references many other types, those are transitive and not direct dependencies of AnnotationAppender.OnMethod in the provided data, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
