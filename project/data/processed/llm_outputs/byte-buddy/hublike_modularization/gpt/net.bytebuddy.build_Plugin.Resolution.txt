    "justification": "Plugin.Resolution has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and only 1 incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin). The definition of Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies. (Note: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself depends on many types, but Plugin.Resolution has a single direct connection to that class and therefore is not a hub in isolation.)"
