    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant). Outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has only one incoming and two outgoing abstractions, so it does not meet the \"hub-like\" criterion. Note: although the outgoing target classes themselves have many dependencies, the analysis must consider the class in isolation, so only its direct incoming/outgoing counts are relevant."
