    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForPackageType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.PackageDescription) and only one incoming dependent class (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter). Although the incoming TypeWriter entry lists many dependencies, those are TypeWriter's own dependencies, not additional direct incoming links to ForPackageType. With incoming degree = 1 and outgoing degree = 1, this does not meet the criterion of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
