    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation.WithImplicitInvocationTargetType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here, the only referencing class is MethodInvocation (listed in incoming_dependencies), and there are no outbound links from the analyzed class, so it does not exhibit hub-like coupling."
