    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Because there are no incoming dependencies and the number of outgoing dependencies is small, it does not meet the hub-like modularization smell."
