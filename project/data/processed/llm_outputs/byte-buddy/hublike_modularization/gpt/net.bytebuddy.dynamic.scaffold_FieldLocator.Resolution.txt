Outgoing dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator). The class does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. Note: dependent targets have many internal dependencies, but per the analysis constraint the class is considered in isolation."
