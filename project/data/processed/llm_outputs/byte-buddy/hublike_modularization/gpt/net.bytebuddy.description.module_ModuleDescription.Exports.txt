    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription.Exports",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ModuleDescription.Exports has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription) and only two direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher and net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable). Although JavaDispatcher (one outgoing target) lists many internal dependencies, the analyzed class itself has a small number of direct incoming and outgoing connections, so it does not meet the criterion of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
