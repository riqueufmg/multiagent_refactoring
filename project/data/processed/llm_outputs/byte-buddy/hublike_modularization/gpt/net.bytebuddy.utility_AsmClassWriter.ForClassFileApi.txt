    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.ForClassFileApi",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct relationships: only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher and net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin) and a single incoming reference from net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter. While the two target classes themselves list many dependencies, those are indirect for ForClassFileApi. Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing direct dependencies; ForClassFileApi does not (outgoing=2, incoming=1), so it is not a hub."
