    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. For PrimitiveNarrowingDelegate the provided data shows 0 incoming dependencies and 5 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Because there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing degree is small, it does not meet the hub-like modularization criteria."
