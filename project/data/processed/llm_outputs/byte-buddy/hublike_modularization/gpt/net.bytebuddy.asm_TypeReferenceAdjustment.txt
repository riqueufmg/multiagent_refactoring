    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeReferenceAdjustment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. For net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeReferenceAdjustment the provided data shows 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []) and 11 outgoing dependencies (OpenedClassReader, ElementMatchers, FieldList, MethodList, TypePool, FieldDescription, ElementMatcher, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AsmVisitorWrapper, TypeDescription, Implementation). Because there are no incoming dependencies, the class does not meet the requirement of having both many incoming and outgoing connections and therefore is not detected as Hub-like Modularization."
