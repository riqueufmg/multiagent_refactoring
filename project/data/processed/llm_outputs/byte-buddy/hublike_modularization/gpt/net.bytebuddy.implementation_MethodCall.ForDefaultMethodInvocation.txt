    "justification": "Not detected: The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections. Although the outgoing targets themselves reference many types, the inspected class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies."
