    "justification": "Not detected: the class has outgoing dependencies to six distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) but only a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming coupling is low and the overall number of distinct incoming/outgoing relationships is not sufficiently large to qualify as a hub."
