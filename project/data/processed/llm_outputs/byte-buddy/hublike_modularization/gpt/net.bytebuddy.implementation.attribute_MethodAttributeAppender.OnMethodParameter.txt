    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender.OnMethodParameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []), and only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender). Although those target classes list many of their own dependencies, the subject class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing connections, so it is not a hub."
