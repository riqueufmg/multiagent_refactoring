    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has none, so the smell is not present."
