    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.Discovery",

    "justification": "Discovery has a single outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo (analyzed_package.dependencies) and a single incoming dependency from the same class (incoming_dependencies shows ByteBuddyMojo depends on Discovery). There are not a large number of distinct incoming and outgoing relationships with other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
