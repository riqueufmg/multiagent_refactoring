    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate.ExplicitlyTypedUnboxingResponsible",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate) and 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate). Both incoming and outgoing fan‑counts are small, so there is no evidence it functions as a hub with large numbers of incoming and outgoing relationships. (Although TypeDescription itself lists many related types, that reflects the dependency's internal surface, not many direct incoming/outgoing ties for the analyzed class when considered in isolation.)"
