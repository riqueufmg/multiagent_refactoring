    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. EqualsMethod.Appender has 7 outgoing dependencies (MethodReturn, StackManipulation, MethodVariableAccess, FieldDescription, ElementMatcher, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription) but zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Although some outgoing targets (e.g., TypeDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) themselves depend on many abstractions, the class lacks incoming coupling, so it does not meet the 'both incoming and outgoing with a large number' condition for a hub."
