Outgoing direct dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only two direct outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
