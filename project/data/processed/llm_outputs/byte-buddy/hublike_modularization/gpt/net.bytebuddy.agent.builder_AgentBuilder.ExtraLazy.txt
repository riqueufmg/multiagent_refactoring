    "justification": "AgentBuilder.ExtraLazy has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition. (Per the constraint to analyze the class in isolation, TypePool's internal/deep dependencies are not considered direct dependencies of ExtraLazy.)"
