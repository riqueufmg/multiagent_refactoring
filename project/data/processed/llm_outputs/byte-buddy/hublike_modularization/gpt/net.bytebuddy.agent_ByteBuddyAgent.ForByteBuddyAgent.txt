    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.Installer) and only one incoming depender (net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; this class's incoming count = 1 and outgoing count = 1, so it does not meet the criterion."
