    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent). Although ByteBuddyAgent lists many dependencies, AttachmentTypeEvaluator itself does not have both many incoming and many outgoing connections required for Hub-like Modularization; it interacts only with a single other abstraction, so the smell is not detected."
