    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Although those outgoing targets themselves reference many classes, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of incoming/outgoing links, so it is not a hub."
