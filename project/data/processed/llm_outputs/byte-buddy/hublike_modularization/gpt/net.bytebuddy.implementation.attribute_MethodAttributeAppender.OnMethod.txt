    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender) and only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows a single incoming and a single outgoing dependency, so the smell is not present."
