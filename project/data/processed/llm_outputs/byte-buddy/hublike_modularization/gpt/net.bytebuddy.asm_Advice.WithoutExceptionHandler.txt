    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). Although that outgoing target lists many dependent types, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing couplings required for Hub-like Modularization (incoming=0, outgoing=1), so the smell is not detected."
