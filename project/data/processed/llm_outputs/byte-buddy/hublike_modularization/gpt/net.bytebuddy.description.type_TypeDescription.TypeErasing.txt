    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency listed (from net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Although that incoming class references many other types, the analyzed class itself is only referenced by one other abstraction and does not depend on many others, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
