    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader) and one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and many outgoing). Although the outgoing target JavaDispatcher itself lists many dependencies, the analyzed class directly connects to only a single incoming and a single outgoing abstraction, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
