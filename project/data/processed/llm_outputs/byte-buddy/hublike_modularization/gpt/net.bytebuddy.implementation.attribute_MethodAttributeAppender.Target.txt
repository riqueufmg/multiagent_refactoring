    "justification": "Per the provided data the class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.MethodAttributeAppender) and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender). By the definition of Hub-like Modularization (an abstraction having incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions), these counts are small; therefore this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
