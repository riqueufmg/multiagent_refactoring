    "justification": "ResubmissionEnforcer has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). While AgentBuilder lists many dependencies, ResubmissionEnforcer itself is referenced by a single class and does not depend on other abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
