    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Plugin.Element has a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and a single incoming dependency source (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and Plugin list many other dependencies, Plugin.Element itself shows only one incoming and one outgoing relationship, so it does not qualify as a hub."
