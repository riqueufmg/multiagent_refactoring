    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.utility.QueueFactory). Outgoing dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; this class only has a single incoming and a single outgoing dependency. Note: JavaDispatcher lists many dependencies, but those are dependencies of JavaDispatcher, not direct additional incoming/outgoing ties for QueueFactory.Dispatcher, so the class is not a hub."
