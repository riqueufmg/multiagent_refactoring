    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = 0) and only five direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodReturn, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; the absence of incoming dependencies (and only five direct outgoing targets in the provided data) prevents classification as a hub."
