    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has only three direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool. It has a single direct incoming dependency listed: net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class shows low fan-in (1) and low fan-out (3), so the hub-like smell is not detected. Note: although the referenced classes themselves have many dependencies, the analysis considers the class in isolation and counts only its direct incoming/outgoing relationships."
