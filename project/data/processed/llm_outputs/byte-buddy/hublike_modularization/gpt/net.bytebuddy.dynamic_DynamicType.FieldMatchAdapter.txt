    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to five abstractions (net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections; since there are no incoming dependencies, this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
