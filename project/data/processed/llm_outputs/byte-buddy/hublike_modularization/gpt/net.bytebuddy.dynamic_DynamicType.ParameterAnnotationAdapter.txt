    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription). Although those outgoing targets themselves reference many other types, the class in isolation does not exhibit both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
