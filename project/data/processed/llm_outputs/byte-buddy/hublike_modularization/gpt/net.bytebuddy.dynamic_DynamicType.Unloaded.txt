    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []). Although it has outgoing dependencies to five abstractions (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.InjectionClassLoader, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin), Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. The absence of any incoming dependencies prevents this class from being a hub."
