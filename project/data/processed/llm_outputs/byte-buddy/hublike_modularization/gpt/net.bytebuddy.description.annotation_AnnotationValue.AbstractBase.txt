    "justification": "The class has only one recorded outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and only one recorded incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and many outgoing); this class shows a very small number of incoming and outgoing relations, so it is not a hub."
