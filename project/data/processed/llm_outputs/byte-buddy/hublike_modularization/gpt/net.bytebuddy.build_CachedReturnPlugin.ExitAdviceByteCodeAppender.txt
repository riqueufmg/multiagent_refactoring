    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; the provided data shows few connections (0 incoming, 2 outgoing), so it is not a hub."
