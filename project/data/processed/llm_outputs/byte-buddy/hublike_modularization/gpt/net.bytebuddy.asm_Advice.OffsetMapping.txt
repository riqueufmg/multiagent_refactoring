    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OffsetMapping",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependency fan-out is high (≈20 distinct target classes such as net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, etc.), but incoming dependency fan-in is low (only a single listed incoming abstraction: net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming side is not large, so the class does not qualify as a hub."
