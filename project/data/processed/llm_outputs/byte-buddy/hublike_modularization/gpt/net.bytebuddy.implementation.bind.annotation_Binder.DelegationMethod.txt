    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no classes depend on this abstraction). Outgoing dependencies: 4 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodAccessorFactory). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class has no incoming dependencies and only a small number of outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
