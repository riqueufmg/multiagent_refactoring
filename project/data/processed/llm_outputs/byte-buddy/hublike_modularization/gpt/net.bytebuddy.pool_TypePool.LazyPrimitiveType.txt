    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool. Because incoming = 0 and outgoing targets are limited to these two abstractions, the class does not meet the 'hub-like' criteria."
