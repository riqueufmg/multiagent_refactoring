    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). The smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; those counts are low here, so the criterion is not met."
