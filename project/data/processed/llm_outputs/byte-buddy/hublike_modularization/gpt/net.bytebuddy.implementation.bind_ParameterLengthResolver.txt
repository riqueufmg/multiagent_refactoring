    "justification": "ParameterLengthResolver has a small number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Outgoing dependencies (2): net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder. Incoming dependencies (2): net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.AmbiguityResolver. The total set of directly connected abstractions is small (3 distinct abstractions), so it does not meet the \"large number of other abstractions\" criterion for Hub-like Modularization."
