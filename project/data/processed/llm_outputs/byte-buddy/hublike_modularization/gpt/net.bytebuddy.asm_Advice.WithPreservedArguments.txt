    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited to 2 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Incoming dependencies originate from a single abstraction: net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships; here there are few distinct incoming (1) and outgoing (2) dependencies, so the smell is not present."
