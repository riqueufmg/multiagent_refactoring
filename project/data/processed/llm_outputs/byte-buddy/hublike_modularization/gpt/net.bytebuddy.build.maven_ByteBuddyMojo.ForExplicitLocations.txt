    "justification": "The class has only one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin) and zero incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. Although the referenced Plugin class itself depends on many other types, the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions nor is it heavily depended upon, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
