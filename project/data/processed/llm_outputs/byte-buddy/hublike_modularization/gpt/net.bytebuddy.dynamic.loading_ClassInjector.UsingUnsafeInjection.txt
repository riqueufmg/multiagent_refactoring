    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies and 6 outgoing dependencies (Visibility, TypeValidation, ClassLoadingStrategy, ConstructorStrategy, DynamicType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although some outgoing targets themselves depend on many classes, the absence of incoming dependencies means this class is not acting as a hub."
