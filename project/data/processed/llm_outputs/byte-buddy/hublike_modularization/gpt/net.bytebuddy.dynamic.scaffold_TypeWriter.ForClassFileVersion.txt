    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion). Because there are no incoming dependencies and the number of direct outgoing dependencies is small, this class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
