    "justification": "MethodSortMatcher has a small number of direct relationships: 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.MethodSortMatcher.Sort, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and 2 incoming dependencies (net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers, net.bytebuddy.matcher.MethodSortMatcher.Sort). A Hub-like Modularization smell requires the abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only a few direct dependents and dependencies, so it does not qualify as a hub."
