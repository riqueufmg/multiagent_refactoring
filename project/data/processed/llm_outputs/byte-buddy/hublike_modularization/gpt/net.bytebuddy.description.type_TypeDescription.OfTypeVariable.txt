    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 9 (TypeList, RecordComponentDescription, MethodDescription, StackSize, CachedReturnPlugin, FieldDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AnnotationSource, TypeDescription). Incoming dependencies: 1 (only net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription lists OfTypeVariable). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing connections. This class has a moderate number of outgoing links but only a single incoming dependency, so it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
