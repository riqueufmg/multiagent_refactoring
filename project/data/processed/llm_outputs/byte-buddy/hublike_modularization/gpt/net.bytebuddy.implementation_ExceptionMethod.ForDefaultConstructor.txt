    "justification": "Not detected: Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 5 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication). Although those outgoing targets themselves reference many types, the class in isolation lacks the requisite large number of incoming couplings, so it is not a hub."
