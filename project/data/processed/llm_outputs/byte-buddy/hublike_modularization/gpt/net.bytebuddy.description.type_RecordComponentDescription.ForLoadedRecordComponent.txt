    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []). Its outgoing dependencies are limited to five direct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher. Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies and the small number of direct outgoing dependencies indicate this class is not a hub."
