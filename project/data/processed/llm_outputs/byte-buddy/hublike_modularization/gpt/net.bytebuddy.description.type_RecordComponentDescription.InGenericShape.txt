    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although MethodDescription itself has many dependencies, this class does not exhibit numerous incoming and outgoing links (incoming_dependencies = [], outgoing_dependencies = [MethodDescription]), so the smell is not detected."
