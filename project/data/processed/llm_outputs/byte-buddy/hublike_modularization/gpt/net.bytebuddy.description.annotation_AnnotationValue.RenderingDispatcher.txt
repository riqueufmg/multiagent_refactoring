    "justification": "RenderingDispatcher has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) and only one incoming dependency in the provided data (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships; this class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
