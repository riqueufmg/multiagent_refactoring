    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies = 0 (no outgoing dependencies). Incoming dependencies count = 1 (only net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder references this class). Although the incoming class (MethodDelegationBinder) lists many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit both a large number of incoming and outgoing links. Therefore it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
