    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.BridgeMethodImplementation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []). It has only 4 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here incoming = 0 and outgoing is small, so the smell is not present."
