    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.UsingInstrumentation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []) and only two direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the two target classes themselves list many further dependencies, those are transitive dependencies of targets, not incoming links to the analyzed class. Therefore the analyzed class does not meet the hub-like modularization criteria."
