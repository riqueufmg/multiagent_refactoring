    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Writable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: incoming dependencies = 0 (no classes depend on Advice.Writable) and outgoing dependencies = 2 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like modularization requires the abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the two outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, Advice.Writable's own fan-in/fan-out is small, so it is not a hub."
