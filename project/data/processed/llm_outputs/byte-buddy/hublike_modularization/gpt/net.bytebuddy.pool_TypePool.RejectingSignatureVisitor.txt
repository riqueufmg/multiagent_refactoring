    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; this class has neither a large number of outgoing nor incoming dependencies, so it is not a hub."
