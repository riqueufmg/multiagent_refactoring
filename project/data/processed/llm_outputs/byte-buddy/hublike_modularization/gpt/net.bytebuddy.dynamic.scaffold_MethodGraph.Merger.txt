    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Merger",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; this class lacks multiple incoming sources and has no outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit the smell."
