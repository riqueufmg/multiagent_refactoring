    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.SpecialMethodInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming (1) and outgoing (5) counts are low. Although some referenced classes themselves have many dependencies, the analysis (class in isolation) considers only direct connections, so this class does not qualify as a hub."
