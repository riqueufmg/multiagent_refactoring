    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and 0 incoming dependencies. Because incoming dependencies are absent and the outgoing degree is small, the class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
