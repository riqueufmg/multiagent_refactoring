    "justification": "Plugin.Sink is not a hub: it has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin) and 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although the outgoing dependency ClassFileLocator has many dependencies listed, those are not direct dependencies of Plugin.Sink and therefore do not make Plugin.Sink a hub."
