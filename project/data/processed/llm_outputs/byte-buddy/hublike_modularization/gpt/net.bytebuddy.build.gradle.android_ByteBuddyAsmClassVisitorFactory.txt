Outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidService, net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyInstrumentationParameters). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not present. (Although ByteBuddyAndroidService itself depends on many classes, those are dependencies of an outgoing neighbor, not incoming edges to this class.)"
