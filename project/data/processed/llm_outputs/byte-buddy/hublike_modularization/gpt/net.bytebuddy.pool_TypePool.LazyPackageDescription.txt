    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no classes depend on this abstraction). Outgoing dependencies: 3 distinct abstractions - net.bytebuddy.description.type.PackageDescription, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming count = 0 and outgoing count = 3, so the smell is not present. Note: the many dependencies listed under net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool are dependencies of that outgoing abstraction, not direct incoming links to this class, and are not considered when analyzing this class in isolation."
