Incoming dependencies (1): net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. This class has only 4 outgoing and 1 incoming dependency (a single bidirectional link with net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool), which is not a large number of connections and therefore does not qualify as hub-like."
