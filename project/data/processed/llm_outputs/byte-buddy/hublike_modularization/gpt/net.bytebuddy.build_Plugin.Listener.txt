    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin) and only one outgoing dependency (to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are 1, so it does not meet the hub-like pattern."
