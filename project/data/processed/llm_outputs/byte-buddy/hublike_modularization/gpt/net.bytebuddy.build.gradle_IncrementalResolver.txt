    "justification": "IncrementalResolver has only 2 incoming dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTaskExtension, net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTask) and 1 outgoing dependency (org.gradle.work.ChangeType). These are a small number of interacting abstractions, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization (no large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
