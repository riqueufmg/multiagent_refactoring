    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here there are not a large number of direct incoming or outgoing relationships. (Although AnnotationDescription itself lists many dependencies, the analyzed class does not directly exhibit the required many incoming/outgoing dependencies.)"
