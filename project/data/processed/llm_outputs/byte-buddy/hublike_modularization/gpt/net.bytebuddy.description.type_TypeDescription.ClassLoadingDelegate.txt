    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
