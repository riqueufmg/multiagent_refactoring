    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Advice.NoExceptionHandler has a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) and a single outgoing dependency (to net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not: incoming count = 1 (Advice), outgoing count = 1 (TypeDescription). Note that TypeDescription's many dependencies are not direct dependencies of Advice.NoExceptionHandler (it only references TypeDescription), so the class is not a hub."
