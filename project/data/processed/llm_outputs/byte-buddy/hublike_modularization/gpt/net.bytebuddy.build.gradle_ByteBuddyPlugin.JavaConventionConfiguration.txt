    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced ByteBuddyPlugin itself has outgoing dependencies, that does not increase this class's incoming/outgoing counts. Therefore the class is not a hub."
