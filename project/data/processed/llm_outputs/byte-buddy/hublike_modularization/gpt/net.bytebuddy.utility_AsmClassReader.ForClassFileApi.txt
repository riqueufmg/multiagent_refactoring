    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader.ForClassFileApi",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, and net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, and only 1 incoming dependency entry (net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader). Per the definition, a Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Given the small number of direct incoming (1) and outgoing (3) relationships in the provided data, this class is not a hub. (Analysis considers the class in isolation and does not count transitive dependencies.)"
