    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and its direct outgoing dependency set is small."
