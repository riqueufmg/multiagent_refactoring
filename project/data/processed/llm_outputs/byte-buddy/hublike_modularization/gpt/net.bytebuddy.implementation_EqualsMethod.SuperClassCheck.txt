    "justification": "EqualsMethod.SuperClassCheck has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing; this class does not exhibit that (incoming = 1, outgoing = 2)."
