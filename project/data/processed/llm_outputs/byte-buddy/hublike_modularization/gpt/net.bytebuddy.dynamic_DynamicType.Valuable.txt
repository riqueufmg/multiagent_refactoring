    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Valuable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small set of outgoing dependencies (3): net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender. It has only a single incoming dependency entry (1): net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType. Although that incoming class (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType) references many types, the provided data shows only one abstraction depending on DynamicType.Valuable. Because the class does not have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
