    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.TypePropertyComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypePropertyComparator has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod) and one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the counts here are low, so this class is not a hub. Note: FieldDescription itself lists many dependencies, but the analysis of TypePropertyComparator in isolation shows a single outgoing link to that class and does not meet the hub criteria."
