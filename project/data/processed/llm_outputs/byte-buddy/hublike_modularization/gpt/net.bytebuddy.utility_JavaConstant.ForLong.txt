    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Although the outgoing dependency (TypeDescription) itself references many other types, JavaConstant.ForLong does not directly have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
