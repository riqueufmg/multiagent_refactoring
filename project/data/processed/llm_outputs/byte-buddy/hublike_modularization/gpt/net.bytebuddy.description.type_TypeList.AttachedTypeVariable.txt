    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList.AttachedTypeVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies and only three direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeVariableToken, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing links. Considering the class in isolation (direct dependencies only), this class is not highly connected and thus does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
