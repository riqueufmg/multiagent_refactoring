    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForGenericArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. (Transitive dependency counts of the referenced classes are present in the input but, per the isolation constraint, only the analyzed class's direct incoming/outgoing links are considered.)"
