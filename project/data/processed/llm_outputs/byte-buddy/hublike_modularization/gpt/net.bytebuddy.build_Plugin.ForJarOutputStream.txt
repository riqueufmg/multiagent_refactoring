    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). Although the outgoing target lists many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class per the provided data; evaluated in isolation, the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
