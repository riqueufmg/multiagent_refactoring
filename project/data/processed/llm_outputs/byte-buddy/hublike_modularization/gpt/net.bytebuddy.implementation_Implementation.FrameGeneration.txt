    "justification": "Not a hub: the analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and outgoing connections). Given outgoing_dependencies = [] and incoming_dependencies count = 1 in the provided data, the class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
