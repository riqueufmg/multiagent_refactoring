    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypePool.TypeContainment has only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It has a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Because it interacts directly with only one incoming class and three outgoing classes (total small-degree connectivity), it does not meet the criterion of having incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions required for Hub-like Modularization."
