    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.FieldResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 5 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and only 1 incoming dependency entry (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here both counts are small (5 outgoing, 1 incoming), so the smell is not detected."
