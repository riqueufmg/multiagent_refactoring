    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AsmVisitorWrapper.NoOp has 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; here the incoming count is zero and the number of direct outgoing dependencies is small. (Note: the outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, but the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming/outgoing dependencies.)"
