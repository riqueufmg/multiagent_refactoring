    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription.InGenericShape",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. While the two referenced types themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing ties, so the smell is not present."
