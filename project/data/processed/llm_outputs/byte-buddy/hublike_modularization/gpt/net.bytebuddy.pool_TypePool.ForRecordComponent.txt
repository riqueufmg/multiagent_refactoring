    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited to 2 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription. Incoming dependencies are from a single abstraction: net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool (one incoming). The class therefore does not exhibit high fan-in and high fan-out across many abstractions required for Hub-like Modularization."
