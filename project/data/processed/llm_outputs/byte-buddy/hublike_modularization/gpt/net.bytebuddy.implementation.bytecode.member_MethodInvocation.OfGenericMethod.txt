    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming links and therefore does not exhibit the hub-like smell."
