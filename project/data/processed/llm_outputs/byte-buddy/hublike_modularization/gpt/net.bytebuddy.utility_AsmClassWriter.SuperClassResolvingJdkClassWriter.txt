    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.SuperClassResolvingJdkClassWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has a single outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, and a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter. While TypePool itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of SuperClassResolvingJdkClassWriter. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit that pattern."
