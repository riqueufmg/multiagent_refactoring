    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList.OfLoadedInterfaceTypes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of outgoing dependencies (3: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin) and a single incoming dependency shown (1: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only 3 outgoing and 1 incoming dependency, so it does not meet the hub-like threshold. (Analysis performed in isolation using only the provided dependency lists.)"
