    "detection": true,
    "justification": "FieldList is referenced by a large number of other abstractions (33 distinct incoming dependents in the provided data) across multiple packages — e.g. net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter (and its variants), net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool (and its variants), net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription (and many of its inner types), net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers. It also has outgoing dependencies to several core abstractions (5 outgoing: net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). The combination of a very high number of incoming links and direct outgoing links to central types demonstrates that FieldList functions as a hub-like module."
