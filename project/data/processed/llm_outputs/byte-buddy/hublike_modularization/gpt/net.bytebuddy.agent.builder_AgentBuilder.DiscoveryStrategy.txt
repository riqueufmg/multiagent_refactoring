    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.DiscoveryStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder) and one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and many outgoing). Although the outgoing target (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself lists many dependencies, DiscoveryStrategy's direct incoming and outgoing dependency counts are both 1, so it is not a hub."
