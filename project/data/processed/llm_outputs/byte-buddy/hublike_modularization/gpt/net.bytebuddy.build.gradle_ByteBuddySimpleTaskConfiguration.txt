    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddySimpleTask). Although that target class itself depends on net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin and org.gradle.api.tasks.PathSensitivity, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links for the analyzed class. Therefore the class does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
