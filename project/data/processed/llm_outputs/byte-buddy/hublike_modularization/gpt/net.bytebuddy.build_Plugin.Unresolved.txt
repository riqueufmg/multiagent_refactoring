    "justification": "Plugin.Unresolved has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin) and 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links to a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only a single incoming and single outgoing relation, so it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
