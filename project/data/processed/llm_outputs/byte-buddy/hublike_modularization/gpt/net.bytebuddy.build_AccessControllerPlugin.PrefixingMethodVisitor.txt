    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin.PrefixingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only five direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships; this class lacks incoming links and has a small set of direct outgoing dependencies, so it does not qualify as a hub."
