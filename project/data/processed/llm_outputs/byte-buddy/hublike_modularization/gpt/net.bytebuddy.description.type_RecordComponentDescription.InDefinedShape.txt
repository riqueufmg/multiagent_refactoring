    "justification": "The class has a small number of incoming and outgoing dependencies: outgoing to net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription (2 distinct outgoing dependencies) and incoming from net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription (1 incoming dependency). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only a few relationships, so the smell is not detected."
