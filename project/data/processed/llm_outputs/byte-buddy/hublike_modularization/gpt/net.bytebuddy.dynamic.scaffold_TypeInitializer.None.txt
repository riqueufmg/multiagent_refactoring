    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer) but has 0 incoming dependencies. With incoming dependencies = 0 and only 3 outgoing links, it does not meet the 'many incoming and outgoing' criterion for a hub."
