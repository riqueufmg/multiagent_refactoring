    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.ForFloat",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced TypeDescription is highly connected, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing connections and therefore is not a hub."
