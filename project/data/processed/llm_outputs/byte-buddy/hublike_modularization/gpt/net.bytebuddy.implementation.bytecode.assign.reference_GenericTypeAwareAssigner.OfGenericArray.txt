    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced TypeDescription itself depends on many types, the analyzed class does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so the hub-like smell is not present for this class."
