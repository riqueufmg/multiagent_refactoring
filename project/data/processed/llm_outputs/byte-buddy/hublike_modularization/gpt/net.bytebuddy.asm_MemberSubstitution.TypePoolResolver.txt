    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: only net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution references this class. Outgoing dependencies: three direct targets — net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships with numerous other abstractions; here incoming count = 1 and outgoing count = 3, indicating limited direct coupling. Therefore this class does not qualify as a hub."
