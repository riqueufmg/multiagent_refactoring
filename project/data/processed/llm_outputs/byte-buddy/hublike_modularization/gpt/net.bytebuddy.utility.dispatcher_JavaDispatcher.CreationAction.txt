    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependency relationships; here CreationAction lacks outgoing links and is referenced by a single other abstraction, so it does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
