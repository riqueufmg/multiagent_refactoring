    "justification": "Direct outgoing dependencies: 4 (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner). Direct incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has low fan-in and fan-out. Note: while the outgoing dependency classes themselves reference many other types, those are transitive and not direct dependencies of WithImplicitTarget per the provided data."
