    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has multiple outgoing dependencies (8 direct outgoing references: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and those targets themselves reference many other abstractions, but it has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Because it lacks incoming coupling from other abstractions, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
