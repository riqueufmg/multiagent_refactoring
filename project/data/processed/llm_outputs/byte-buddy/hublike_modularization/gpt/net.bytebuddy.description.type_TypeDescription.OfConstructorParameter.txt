    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: only two direct references — net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin (as listed in analyzed_package.dependencies). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not present."
