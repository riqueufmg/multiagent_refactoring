    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not meet that criterion. (While its outgoing targets themselves reference many other abstractions, the smell is evaluated for the class in isolation.)"
