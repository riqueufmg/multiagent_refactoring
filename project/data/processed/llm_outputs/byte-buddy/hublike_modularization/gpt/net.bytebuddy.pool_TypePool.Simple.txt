    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows no incoming dependencies and a small number of outgoing dependencies, so the smell is absent."
