    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 13 distinct abstractions (AnnotationDescription, TypeDefinition, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, MethodVariableAccess, FieldLocator, ParameterDescription, JavaConstant, FieldDescription, JavaType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeList, TypeDescription) — indicating the class depends on many other types. Incoming dependencies: only 1 reported abstraction (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) references this class. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because ForFieldHandle has many outgoing but only a single incoming dependency in the provided data, it does not meet the hub-like modularization smell criteria."
