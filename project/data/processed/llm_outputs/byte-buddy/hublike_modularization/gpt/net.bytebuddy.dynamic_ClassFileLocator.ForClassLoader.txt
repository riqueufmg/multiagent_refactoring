    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForClassLoader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (5): net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy, net.bytebuddy.utility.StreamDrainer, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It has a single incoming dependency recorded: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator depends on ForClassLoader. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here incoming connections = 1 and outgoing connections = 5, which are not a large number. While some referenced types (e.g., TypeDescription) themselves depend on many types, those are not incoming/outgoing links to ForClassLoader itself and do not make it a hub in the provided data."
