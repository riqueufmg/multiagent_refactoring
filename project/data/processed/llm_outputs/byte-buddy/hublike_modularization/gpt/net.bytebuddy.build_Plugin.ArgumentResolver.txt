    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin) and one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections; here there are only single direct incoming and outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
