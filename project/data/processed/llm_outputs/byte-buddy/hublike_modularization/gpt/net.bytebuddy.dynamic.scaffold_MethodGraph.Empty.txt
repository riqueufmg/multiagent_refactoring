    "justification": "MethodGraph.Empty has a small number of connections: 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph) and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph). Because the class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, it does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
