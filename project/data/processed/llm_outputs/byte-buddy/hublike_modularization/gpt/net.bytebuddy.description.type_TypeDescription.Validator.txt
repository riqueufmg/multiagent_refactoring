    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. With only two outgoing and no incoming dependencies, this class does not meet the criteria for a hub."
