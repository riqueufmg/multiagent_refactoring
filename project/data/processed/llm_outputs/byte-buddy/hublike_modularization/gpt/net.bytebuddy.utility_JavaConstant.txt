    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits hub-like modularization: it has a large number of outgoing dependencies (27 distinct abstractions such as net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, etc.) and is referenced (incoming dependencies) by dozens of other classes across multiple packages (examples include net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice and many of its inner classes, net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution and its variants, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder and AgentBuilder.Dispatcher, net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic and related providers, net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.RebaseImplementationTarget, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, and many implementation/bytecode classes). The combination of many incoming callers from varied modules and many outgoing collaborators meets the definition of a hub: a single abstraction with both numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies."
