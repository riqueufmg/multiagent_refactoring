    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class lacks incoming links and has a small number of outgoing links, so it does not exhibit the smell."
