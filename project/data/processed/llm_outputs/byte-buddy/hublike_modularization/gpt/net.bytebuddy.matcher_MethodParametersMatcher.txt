    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.MethodParametersMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MethodParametersMatcher has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming_dependencies is empty and the direct outgoing count is small (2). Although the referenced outgoing classes list many of their own dependencies, MethodParametersMatcher itself does not exhibit the required high-degree incoming/outgoing coupling."
