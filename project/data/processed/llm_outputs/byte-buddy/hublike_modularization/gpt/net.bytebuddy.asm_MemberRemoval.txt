    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberRemoval",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. MemberRemoval has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) while it has multiple outgoing dependencies (12 distinct external abstractions, e.g. OpenedClassReader, MethodDescription, ElementMatchers, FieldList, MethodList, TypePool, FieldDescription, ElementMatcher, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AsmVisitorWrapper, TypeDescription, Implementation). The absence of incoming dependencies prevents it from being a hub."
