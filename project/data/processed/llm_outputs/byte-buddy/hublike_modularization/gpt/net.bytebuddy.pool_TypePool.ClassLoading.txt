    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ClassLoading",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (both incoming and outgoing). Given the low outgoing count and no incoming dependencies, this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
