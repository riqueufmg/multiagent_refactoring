    "justification": "ForTypeVariable has only 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and only 1 incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Although some referenced classes (e.g., TypePool) are highly connected, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
