    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyLowerBoundWildcard",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, and net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although two of the outgoing targets (TypeList and TypePool) themselves list many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing relationships."
