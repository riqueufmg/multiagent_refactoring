    "justification": "The class net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_jmhType_B1 has 0 outgoing dependencies and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class has no incoming or outgoing links, so it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
