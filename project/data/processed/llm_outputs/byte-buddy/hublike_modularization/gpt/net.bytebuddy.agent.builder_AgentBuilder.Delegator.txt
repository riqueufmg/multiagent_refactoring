    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Delegator has only a single outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder (from analyzed_package.dependencies). The incoming references to Delegator appear only from the AgentBuilder entry (AgentBuilder lists AgentBuilder.Delegator). There are no incoming or outgoing links between Delegator and a large number of other abstractions; the many dependencies listed belong to AgentBuilder itself, not to Delegator. Therefore Delegator does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
