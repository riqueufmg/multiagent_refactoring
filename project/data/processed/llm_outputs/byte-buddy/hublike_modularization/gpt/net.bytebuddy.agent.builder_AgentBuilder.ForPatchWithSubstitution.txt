    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForPatchWithSubstitution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.ResettableClassFileTransformer). Although those two outgoing classes themselves reference many other abstractions (each lists ~16 dependencies), the analyzed class does not exhibit both large incoming and outgoing coupling. Therefore it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
