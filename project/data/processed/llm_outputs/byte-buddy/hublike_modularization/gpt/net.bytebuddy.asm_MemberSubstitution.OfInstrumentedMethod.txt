    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfInstrumentedMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not hub-like: the analyzed class has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner) and a single incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing connections; the provided data shows low inbound (1) and low outbound (2) coupling, so it does not qualify as a hub."
