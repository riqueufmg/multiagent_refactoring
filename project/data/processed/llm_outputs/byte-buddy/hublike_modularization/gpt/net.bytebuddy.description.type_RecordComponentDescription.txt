    "justification": "RecordComponentDescription exhibits hub-like modularization: it has a sizable set of outgoing dependencies (13) including core collaborators such as net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher and several build/plugin types (AccessControllerPlugin, CachedReturnPlugin), plus its own nested types (RecordComponent, Token, InDefinedShape). More importantly, it has a very large number of incoming dependencies (approximately 70) from many central modules and types (examples: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType and its Builder/AbstractBase/Adapter/RecordComponentDefinitionAdapter, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter and many of its variants, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool and many of its subtypes, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and numerous TypeDescription variants, net.bytebuddy.InstrumentedType, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, matcher/LatentMatcher, RecordComponentList and related classes, and the RecordComponentAttributeAppender). The combination of many callers (wide incoming fan-in) and multiple collaborators it depends on (outgoing fan-out) indicates RecordComponentDescription functions as a hub-like abstraction."
