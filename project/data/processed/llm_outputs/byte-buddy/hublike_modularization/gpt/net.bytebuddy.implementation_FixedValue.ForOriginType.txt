    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FixedValue.ForOriginType has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing connections, so it is not a hub."
