    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.SuperTypeLoading",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder) and only two direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependency connections. Although the two outgoing classes themselves list many dependencies, the analyzed class itself is directly connected to only a small number of other abstractions, so it does not qualify as a hub."
