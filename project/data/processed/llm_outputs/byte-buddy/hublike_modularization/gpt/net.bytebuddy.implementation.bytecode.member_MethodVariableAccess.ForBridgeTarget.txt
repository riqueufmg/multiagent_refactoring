    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess.ForBridgeTarget",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = 0) and only two direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Although the two outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing connections, so the smell is not detected."
