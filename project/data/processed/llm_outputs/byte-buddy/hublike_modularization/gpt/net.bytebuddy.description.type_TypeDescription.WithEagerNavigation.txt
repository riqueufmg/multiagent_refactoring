    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.WithEagerNavigation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; these counts are minimal. Although the incoming and outgoing target classes (TypeDescription and TypeList) themselves reference many types, that does not increase the number of direct incoming/outgoing relationships for WithEagerNavigation, so the hub smell is not present."
