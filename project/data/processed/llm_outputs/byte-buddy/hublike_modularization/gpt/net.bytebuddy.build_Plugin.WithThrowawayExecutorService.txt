    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.WithThrowawayExecutorService",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and only one incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin shows many dependencies, the analyzed class itself has low incoming and outgoing coupling, so it does not qualify as a hub in isolation."
