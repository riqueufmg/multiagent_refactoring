    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are empty (no outgoing edges). There is only a single incoming dependency entry (net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter). Although that incoming class lists many dependencies, the analyzed class itself has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming reference; Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Given the class-in-isolation data (empty outgoing_dependencies and a single incoming dependency), the smell is not present."
