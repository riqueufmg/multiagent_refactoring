    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ClassFileBufferStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.ClassFileBufferStrategy has only one incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder) and one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). The hub-like modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class shows a single incoming and a single outgoing relationship, so it does not meet the criteria. Note: although the outgoing target ClassFileLocator has many dependencies, the analyzed class itself directly depends on only that one abstraction."
