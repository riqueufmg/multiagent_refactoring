    "justification": "ClassFileLocator.NoOp has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator). Although the referring ClassFileLocator lists many dependencies, NoOp itself is not connected (neither incoming nor outgoing) to a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
