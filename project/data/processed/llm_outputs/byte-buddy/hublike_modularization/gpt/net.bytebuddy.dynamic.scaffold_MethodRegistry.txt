    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "MethodRegistry exhibits hub-like modularization: it has a large number of outgoing dependencies (23 distinct abstractions) and a large number of incoming dependents (24 distinct abstractions). Outgoing examples (23) include TypeValidation, TypeInitializer, MethodRegistry.Prepared, Transformer, VisibilityBridgeStrategy, MethodAttributeAppender, MethodGraph, TypeWriter, MethodDescription, InstrumentedType, Implementation, TypeDescription and ClassFileVersion. Incoming examples (24) include core high-level consumers such as net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType (and its Builder/Adapter/AbstractBase/MethodDefinition variants), multiple TypeWriter variants (Default, ForInlining, WithFullProcessing), various dynamic scaffold builders (SubclassDynamicTypeBuilder, RebaseDynamicTypeBuilder, AbstractInliningDynamicTypeBuilder, RedefinitionDynamicTypeBuilder), ByteBuddy, and MethodRegistry's own nested types (MethodRegistry.Compiled, MethodRegistry.Prepared, MethodRegistry.Default). Notably, there are bidirectional/cyclic links: MethodRegistry depends on MethodRegistry.Prepared/Compiled/ForVisibilityBridge/Handler while those nested types also list MethodRegistry as a dependency, indicating tight two-way coupling. The breadth of both incoming and outgoing connections and the presence of mutual references justify flagging MethodRegistry as a hub-like abstraction."
