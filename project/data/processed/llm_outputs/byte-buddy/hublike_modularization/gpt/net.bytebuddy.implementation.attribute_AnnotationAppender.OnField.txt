    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
