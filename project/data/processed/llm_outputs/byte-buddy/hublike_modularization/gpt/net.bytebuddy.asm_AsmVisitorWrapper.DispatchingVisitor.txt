    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no classes depend on this class). Outgoing dependencies: 5 direct targets (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Although some target classes have many internal dependencies, the analyzed class itself has a small number of outgoing links and no incoming links. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
