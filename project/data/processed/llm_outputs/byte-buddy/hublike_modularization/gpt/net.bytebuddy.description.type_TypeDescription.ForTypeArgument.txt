    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForTypeArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher. Although those two target classes each depend on many other abstractions (16 listed for each), the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of direct incoming or outgoing connections. Therefore it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization criterion."
