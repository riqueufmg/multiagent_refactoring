    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodReturn, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, but it has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; the absence of any incoming dependencies (and only a modest number of outgoing dependencies) means this class is not a hub."
