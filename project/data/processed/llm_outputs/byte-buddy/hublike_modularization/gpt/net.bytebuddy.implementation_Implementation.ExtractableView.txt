    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct relationships: 5 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; the provided data shows only a few incoming/outgoing links, so this class is not a hub."
