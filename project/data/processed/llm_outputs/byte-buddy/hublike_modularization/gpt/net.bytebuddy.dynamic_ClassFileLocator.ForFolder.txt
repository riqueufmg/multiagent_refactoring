    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.StreamDrainer). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; the provided data shows low coupling in both directions, so the smell is not detected."
