    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine) and only one incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent). A hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies with other abstractions; the provided data shows only a single incoming and a single outgoing relation, so it does not qualify as hub-like."
