    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FieldDescription has a very large number of incoming dependencies (numerous classes across many packages depend on it — examples from the incoming list include net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Builder, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool and many net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold and net.bytebuddy.implementation classes), indicating it is widely referenced. However, its direct outgoing dependency set is relatively small: the analyzed_package lists 9 direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.DeclaredByType, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription.SignatureToken, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription.InDefinedShape, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable). Because Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions (many incoming and many outgoing), FieldDescription does not meet that criterion here (many incoming but only a limited set of outgoing dependencies). Therefore the smell is not detected."
