    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.implementation.SuperMethodCall). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here the counts are low. While the incoming class (net.bytebuddy.implementation.SuperMethodCall) lists multiple dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing links."
