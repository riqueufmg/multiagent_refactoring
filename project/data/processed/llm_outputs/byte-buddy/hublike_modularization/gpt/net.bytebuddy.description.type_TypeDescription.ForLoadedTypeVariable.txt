    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although that outgoing dependency itself references many types, the analyzed class does not have both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships. Based on the provided data (incoming_dependencies = [], outgoing count = 1), the Hub-like Modularization smell is not detected."
