    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.PluginArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PluginArgument has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Transformation). Counts: outgoing = 1, incoming = 1. Although the referenced Plugin class itself depends on many abstractions, PluginArgument does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing relations itself, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell when considered in isolation."
