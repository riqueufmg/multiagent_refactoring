    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Here, outgoing dependencies = 0 and incoming dependencies = 1, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
