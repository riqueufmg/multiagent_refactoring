    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. FixedValue has a substantial number of outgoing dependencies (17 distinct outgoing dependencies such as net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.ForNullValue, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.utility.RandomString, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstantValue, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, etc.), but it has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Because it lacks many incoming dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub-shaped module and therefore is not detected as Hub-like Modularization."
