    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has no incoming dependencies and only one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Although that outgoing dependency references many other types, those are indirect and do not make the analyzed class a hub. Therefore the smell is not detected."
