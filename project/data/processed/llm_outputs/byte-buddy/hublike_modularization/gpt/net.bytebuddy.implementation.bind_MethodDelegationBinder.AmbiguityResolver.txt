    "justification": "AmbiguityResolver has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct abstractions: ArgumentTypeResolver, ParameterLengthResolver, MethodNameEqualityResolver, DeclaringTypeResolver, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Resolver, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and MethodDelegationBinder. However, it has a single incoming dependency (only MethodDelegationBinder references AmbiguityResolver). Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing set is moderate (7) but the incoming set is minimal (1), so it does not qualify as a hub."
