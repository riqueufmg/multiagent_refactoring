    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low connectivity in both directions, so the smell is not present."
