    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself references many types, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links to the analyzed class, so the class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
