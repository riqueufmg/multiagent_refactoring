    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a connectivity hub: it has a large number of outgoing dependencies (≈37 distinct targets listed, e.g. nested/related types such as Plugin.ForSerialTransformation, Plugin.Default, Plugin.Factory, Plugin.Target, and many core types like net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). At the same time it receives many incoming dependencies from many other components and modules (examples: net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Transformer, multiple build plugins such as CachedReturnPlugin, RepeatedAnnotationPlugin, AccessControllerPlugin, ToStringPlugin, SafeVarargsPlugin, many net.bytebuddy.build.maven and net.bytebuddy.build.gradle classes and tasks, and numerous internal build/engine classes). The presence of dozens of both incoming and outgoing links (multiple packages and features depend on Plugin and Plugin depends on many other abstractions) fits the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
