    "justification": "The class has only one direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that condition. (Note: the listed HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin has many dependencies, but the analyzed class itself only references that single abstraction.)"
