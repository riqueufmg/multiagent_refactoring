    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.TerminationHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TerminationHandler has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and a single incoming dependency entry (net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the direct dependency counts for this class are low. Note: while the outgoing dependency classes themselves reference many other types, those are not direct incoming/outgoing dependencies of TerminationHandler and therefore do not make it a hub."
