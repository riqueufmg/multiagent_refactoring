    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Binder.Unresolved has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder) and 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing target DynamicType itself references many classes, those are not direct dependencies of Binder.Unresolved in the provided data and the analysis is constrained to the class in isolation. Therefore it does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
