    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; here both counts are low (incoming=1, outgoing=0). Although the incoming class (ByteBuddyAgent) lists many dependencies, those are dependencies of that class, not many distinct incoming/outgoing links for ForModularizedVm itself."
