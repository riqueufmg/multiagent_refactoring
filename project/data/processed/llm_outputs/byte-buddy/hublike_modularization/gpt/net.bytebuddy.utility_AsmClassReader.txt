    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "AsmClassReader has incoming dependencies from a large number of distinct abstractions (34 distinct dependents in the provided data) including net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType (and many of its inner/related builder/base classes), net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter (and many TypeWriter variants), net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice (and related Advice components), net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool (and multiple TypePool variants), net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter (and its factories/defaults), and net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader. It also has multiple outgoing dependencies to several other abstractions across packages: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader.ForClassFileApi, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader.JdkClassReader, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader.Factory, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader.Default, and net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher. The combination of many incoming connections from diverse subsystems and multiple outgoing dependencies identifies AsmClassReader as a central connector (hub) between many abstractions, meeting the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
