    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.Invoker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Invoker has 0 outgoing dependencies and only a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing connection counts are low. The fact that JavaDispatcher depends on many classes does not increase Invoker's incoming/outgoing counts in the provided data."
