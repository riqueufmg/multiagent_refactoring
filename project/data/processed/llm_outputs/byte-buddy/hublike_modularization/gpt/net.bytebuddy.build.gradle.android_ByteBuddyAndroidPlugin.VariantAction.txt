    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.VariantAction",

    "justification": "The class has only one direct outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidService, and it has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing target (ByteBuddyAndroidService) itself depends on many abstractions, those are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class and, given the class-isolation constraint, do not make this class hub-like."
