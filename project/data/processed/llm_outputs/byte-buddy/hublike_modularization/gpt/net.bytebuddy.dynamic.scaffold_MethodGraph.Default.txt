    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 6 direct dependencies — net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; this class has no incoming dependencies and only six direct outgoing dependencies (though some targets themselves reference many types), so it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module in isolation."
