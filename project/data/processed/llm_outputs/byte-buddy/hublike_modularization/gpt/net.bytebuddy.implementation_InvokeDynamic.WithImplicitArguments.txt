    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.WithImplicitArguments",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only two outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, and only one incoming dependency entry (net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Here the outgoing degree = 2 and incoming degree = 1 (only InvokeDynamic references it), so it does not exhibit a hub-like dependency profile. Note: although the referenced classes list many of their own dependencies in the provided data, the analyzed class itself directly connects to only the two named classes and a single incoming class, which is insufficient to qualify as a hub."
