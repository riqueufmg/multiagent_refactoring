    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator) and zero incoming dependencies. Although those outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, the class in isolation has a small number of outgoing links and no incoming links, so it does not qualify as hub-like."
