    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Considering the class in isolation (per provided data), it has no incoming links and only three direct outgoing links. Although those three target classes themselves reference many types, those references are not incoming dependencies of the analyzed class. Therefore this class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
