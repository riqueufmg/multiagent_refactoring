    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. TextConstant has 0 incoming dependencies and 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Because there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing count is small, the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
