    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy.Active",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has neither a large number of outgoing dependencies nor any incoming dependencies, so it does not exhibit the smell."
