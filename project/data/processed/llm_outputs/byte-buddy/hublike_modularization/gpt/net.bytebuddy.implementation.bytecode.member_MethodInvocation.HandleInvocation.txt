    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation.HandleInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []). It has outgoing dependencies to four abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 while outgoing = 4, so the criterion (both large incoming and outgoing coupling) is not met. (Although the outgoing targets themselves reference many types, that does not create a high incoming degree for this class.)"
