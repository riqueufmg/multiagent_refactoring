    "justification": "Transitivity has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor) and two incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable and net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase). Although those incoming classes reference many modifier types, Transitivity itself is directly connected to only three other abstractions total, which is not a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies required to qualify as hub-like modularization."
