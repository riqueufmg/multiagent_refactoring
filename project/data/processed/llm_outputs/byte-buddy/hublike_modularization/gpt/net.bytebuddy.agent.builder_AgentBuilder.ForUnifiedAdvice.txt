    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForUnifiedAdvice",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Although the outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing connections (incoming: none; outgoing: 2), so it is not a hub."
