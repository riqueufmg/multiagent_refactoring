    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder) and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodNameTransformer). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing ties with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only a small number of connections, so this class is not exhibiting a hub-like modularization smell."
