    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.AnnotationTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AnnotationTypeMatcher has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Although one outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself references many other types, AnnotationTypeMatcher's direct dependency count is low and there are no incoming dependencies, so the hub-like smell is not present."
