    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation.Trivial",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to two abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing count = 2 and incoming count = 0, so the smell is not present."
