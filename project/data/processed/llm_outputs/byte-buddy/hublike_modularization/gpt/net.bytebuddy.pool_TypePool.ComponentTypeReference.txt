    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is an empty list) and only 1 incoming dependency (only referenced by net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class lacks a large out-degree and has a minimal in-degree, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria. (Note: net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool references many other abstractions, but that makes TypePool a hub, not this analyzed class.)"
