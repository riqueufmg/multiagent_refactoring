    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Although the outgoing targets themselves reference many types, the analyzed class itself lacks incoming coupling and only references three other abstractions, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
