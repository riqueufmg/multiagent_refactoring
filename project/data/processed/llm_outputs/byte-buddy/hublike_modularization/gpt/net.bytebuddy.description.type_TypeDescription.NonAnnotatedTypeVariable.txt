    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming dependencies are empty and outgoing dependency count is small. Although the outgoing targets themselves reference many types, the analysis must consider the class in isolation, so it is not a hub."
