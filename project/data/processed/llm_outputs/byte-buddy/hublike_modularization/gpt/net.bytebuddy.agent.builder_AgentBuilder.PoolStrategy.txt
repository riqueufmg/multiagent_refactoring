    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.PoolStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Based on the provided data the class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder) and four outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the counts here (1 incoming, 4 outgoing) are low, so the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell under the provided, in-isolation data."
