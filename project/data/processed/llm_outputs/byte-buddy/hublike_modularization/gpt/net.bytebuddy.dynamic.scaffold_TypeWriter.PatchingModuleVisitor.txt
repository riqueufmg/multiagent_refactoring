    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: 2 (direct dependencies only: net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader and net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has neither a large outgoing set nor any incoming dependencies, so the smell is not present."
