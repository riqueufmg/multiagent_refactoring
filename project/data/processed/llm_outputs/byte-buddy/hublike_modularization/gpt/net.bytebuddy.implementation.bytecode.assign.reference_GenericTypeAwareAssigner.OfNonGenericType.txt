    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner.OfNonGenericType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and it has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and/or outgoing dependencies. Although TypeDescription itself lists many dependencies, the analysis must consider the class in isolation; the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, so it is not a hub."
