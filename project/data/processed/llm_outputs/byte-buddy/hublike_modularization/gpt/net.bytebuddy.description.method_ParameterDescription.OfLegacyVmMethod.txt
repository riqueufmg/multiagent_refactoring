    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class lacks incoming links and has a small number of outgoing links."
