    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription) and zero incoming dependencies. The low number of outgoing connections and absence of incoming connections do not meet the 'hub-like' criteria."
