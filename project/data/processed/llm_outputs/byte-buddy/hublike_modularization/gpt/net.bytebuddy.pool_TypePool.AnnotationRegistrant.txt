    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are empty (no outgoing links). Incoming dependencies contain only a single class: net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool (which lists TypePool.AnnotationRegistrant among many of its own dependencies). Because AnnotationRegistrant has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependent, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (it does not have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies)."
