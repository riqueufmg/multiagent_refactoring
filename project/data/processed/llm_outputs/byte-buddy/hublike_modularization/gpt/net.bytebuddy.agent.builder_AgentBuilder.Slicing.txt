    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Slicing has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the single outgoing target (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself references many classes, the analyzed class does not have a large number of direct incoming or outgoing relations, so it is not a hub."
