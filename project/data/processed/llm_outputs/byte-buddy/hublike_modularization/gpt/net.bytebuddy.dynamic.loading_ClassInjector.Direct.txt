    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction itself to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although that single outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) references many types (16 listed dependencies), the ClassInjector.Direct class does not show a large number of direct incoming or outgoing connections in the provided data, so it is not a hub."
