    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. ForMethodInvocation has 7 outgoing direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) but only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). The incoming coupling is minimal (single client), so the class does not act as a hub connecting many other abstractions and therefore does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
