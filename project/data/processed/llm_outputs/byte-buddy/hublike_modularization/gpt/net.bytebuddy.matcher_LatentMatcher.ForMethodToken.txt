    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher.ForMethodToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has outgoing dependencies to only three abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although one outgoing target (MethodDescription) and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin themselves reference many types, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing relations (outgoing count = 3, incoming count = 0), so it is not a hub."
