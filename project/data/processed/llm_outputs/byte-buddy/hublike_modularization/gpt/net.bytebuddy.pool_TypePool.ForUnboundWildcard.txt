    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForUnboundWildcard",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and many outgoing). The provided data shows low fan-in and fan-out limited to one or two classes, so this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
