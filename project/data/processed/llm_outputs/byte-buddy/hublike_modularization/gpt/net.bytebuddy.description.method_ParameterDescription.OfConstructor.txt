Outgoing dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependency links; this class has no incoming dependencies and only three outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria. Note: although the outgoing target classes themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing links and therefore is not a hub."
