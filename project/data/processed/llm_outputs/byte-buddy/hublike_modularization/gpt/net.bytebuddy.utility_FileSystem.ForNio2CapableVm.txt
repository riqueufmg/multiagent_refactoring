    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition."
