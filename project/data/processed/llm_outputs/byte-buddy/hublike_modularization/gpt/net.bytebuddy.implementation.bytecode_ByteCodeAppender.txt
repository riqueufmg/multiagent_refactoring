    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ByteCodeAppender shows many incoming dependencies from numerous distinct classes and packages (examples include net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall), indicating it is widely depended upon. However, its outgoing dependency set is small and focused (only the five listed dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender.Size). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; here the incoming side is large but the outgoing side is limited, so the smell is not detected."
