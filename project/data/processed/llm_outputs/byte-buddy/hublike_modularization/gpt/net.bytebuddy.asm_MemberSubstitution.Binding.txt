    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Binding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 5 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. It has 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Given the low number of incoming (1) and a modest number of outgoing (5) dependencies in the provided data, this class does not meet the 'hub-like' criteria."
