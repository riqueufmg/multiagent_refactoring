    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Collector has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Although AgentBuilder and TypeDescription themselves reference many other abstractions, the Collector class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships; therefore it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell."
