    "justification": "Attacher has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency source (net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing ties; here Attacher lacks outgoing dependencies and is referenced by a single class, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
