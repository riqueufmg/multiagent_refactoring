    "justification": "Not detected. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although each of the two outgoing targets lists many dependencies themselves (each lists ~16 dependent types), the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of incoming connections nor a large set of direct outgoing links, so it is not a hub."
