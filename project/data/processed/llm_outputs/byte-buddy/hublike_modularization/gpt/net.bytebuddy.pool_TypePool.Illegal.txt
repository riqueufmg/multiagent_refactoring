    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Illegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and a single outgoing dependency (to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; here both incoming and outgoing counts are low (1 each), so the smell is not present."
