    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming AND outgoing dependencies. MethodComparator has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies: []), although it is referenced by four classes: net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.DynamicClassLoader, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList, and net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList.ForLoadedMethods. The absence of outgoing dependencies prevents it from being a hub."
