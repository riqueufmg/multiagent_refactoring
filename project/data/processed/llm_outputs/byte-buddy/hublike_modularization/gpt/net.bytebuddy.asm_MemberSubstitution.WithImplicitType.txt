    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.WithImplicitType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The absence of incoming links and the low outgoing degree indicate this class is not a hub. (Note: TypeDescription's many dependencies are TypeDescription's own outgoing links and are not counted as incoming links to WithImplicitType when analyzing the class in isolation.)"
