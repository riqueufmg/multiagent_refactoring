    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription). The provided outgoing_dependencies entry shows RecordComponentDescription itself references many types, but the analyzed class directly depends on only that single abstraction. Because the class does not exhibit both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty; outgoing count = 1), it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
