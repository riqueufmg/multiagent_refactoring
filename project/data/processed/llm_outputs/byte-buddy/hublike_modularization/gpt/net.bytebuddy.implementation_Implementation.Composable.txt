    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited to 3 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender). Incoming dependencies come from a single abstraction (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Although the Implementation class lists many dependencies, Implementation.Composable itself has only one incoming relationship and three outgoing relationships, which does not constitute a hub-like modularization (not a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
