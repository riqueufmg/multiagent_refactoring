    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (to net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Therefore it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization. (Although the outgoing target TypeDescription lists many dependencies, the smell is evaluated for the analyzed class in isolation, which only connects to one other abstraction.)"
