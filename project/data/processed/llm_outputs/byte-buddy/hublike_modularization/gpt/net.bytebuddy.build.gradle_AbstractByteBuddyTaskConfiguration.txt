    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: three abstractions — AbstractByteBuddyTaskConfiguration.TaskExecutionGraphAdjustmentAction, Discovery, Adjustment. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only three outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not present."
