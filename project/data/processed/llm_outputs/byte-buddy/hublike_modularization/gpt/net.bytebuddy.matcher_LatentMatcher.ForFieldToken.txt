    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here incoming count = 0 and outgoing count = 3 (not a large number), so the smell is not detected."
