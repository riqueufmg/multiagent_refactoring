    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ExecutingTransformer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (11 distinct targets: ResettableClassFileTransformer, TypeValidation, ClassLoadingStrategy, TypeResolutionStrategy, ClassFileLocator, DynamicType, AccessControllerPlugin, ByteBuddy, JavaType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, JavaModule) but only a single incoming dependency is reported (from net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependency relationships. Given only one incoming dependency and eleven outgoing dependencies in the provided data, this class does not meet the criterion of being a hub (insufficient incoming coupling)."
