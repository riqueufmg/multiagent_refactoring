    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyParameterList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Given the low outgoing count (3) and no incoming dependencies in the provided data, this class does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module. Note: some of its outgoing dependency targets themselves depend on many classes, but that does not make this class a hub in isolation."
