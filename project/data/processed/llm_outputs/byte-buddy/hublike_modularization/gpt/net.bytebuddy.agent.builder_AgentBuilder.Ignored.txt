    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Ignored has 0 outgoing dependencies and only a single incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class lacks multiple incoming/outgoing connections. Although AgentBuilder itself has many dependencies, AgentBuilder.Ignored is only referenced by that one class and therefore is not a hub."
