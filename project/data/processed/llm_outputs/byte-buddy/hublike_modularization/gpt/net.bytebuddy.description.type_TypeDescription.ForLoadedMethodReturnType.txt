    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not present."
