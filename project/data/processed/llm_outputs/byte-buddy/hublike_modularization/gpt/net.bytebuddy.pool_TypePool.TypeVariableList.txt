    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.TypeVariableList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has outgoing dependencies to three abstractions: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, and net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool. Its incoming_dependencies list is empty (no incoming links). Although some of its outgoing targets (notably TypePool and TypeList) themselves reference many types, the class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships, so it does not qualify as a hub."
