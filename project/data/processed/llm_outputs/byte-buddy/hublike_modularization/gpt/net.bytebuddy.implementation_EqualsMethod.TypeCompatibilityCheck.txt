    "justification": "The class has a small number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Incoming: referenced by one abstraction - net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod. Outgoing: depends directly on four abstractions - net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess. Because both incoming (1) and outgoing (4) dependency counts are low, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
