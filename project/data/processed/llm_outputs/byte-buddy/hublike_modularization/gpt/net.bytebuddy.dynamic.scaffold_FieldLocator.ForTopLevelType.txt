    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0. Outgoing dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing target (FieldLocator) itself depends on several classes, the analyzed class has no incoming dependencies and only a single outgoing dependency, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
