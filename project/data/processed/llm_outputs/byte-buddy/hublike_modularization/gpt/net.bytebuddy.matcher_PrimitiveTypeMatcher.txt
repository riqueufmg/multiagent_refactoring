    "justification": "PrimitiveTypeMatcher has 0 incoming dependencies and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Although one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself references many classes, PrimitiveTypeMatcher does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing direct dependencies (incoming = 0, outgoing = 2), so it is not a hub."
