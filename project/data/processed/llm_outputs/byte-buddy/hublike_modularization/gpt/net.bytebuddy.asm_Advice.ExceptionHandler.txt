    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ExceptionHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small set of direct outgoing dependencies (6): net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Throw, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Removal. It has a single listed direct incoming dependency (1): net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only 6 outgoing and 1 incoming direct relationships, so it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
