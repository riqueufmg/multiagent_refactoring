    "justification": "InstanceTypeMatcher has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition."
