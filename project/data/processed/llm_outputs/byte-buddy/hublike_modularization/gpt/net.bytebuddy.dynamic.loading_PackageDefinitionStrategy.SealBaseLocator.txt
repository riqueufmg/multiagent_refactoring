    "justification": "SealBaseLocator has only one recorded outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and only one recorded incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.PackageDefinitionStrategy). The outgoing plugin's many internal dependencies are second-level and not direct dependencies of SealBaseLocator. Because the class does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
