    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin (as listed in analyzed_package.dependencies). It has only one incoming dependency source: net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin (the incoming_dependencies entry includes Plugin which references Plugin.ForParallelTransformation). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing relationships; here both incoming and outgoing counts are 1. Note: although HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself depends on many types, those are not direct dependencies of Plugin.ForParallelTransformation, so the class is not a hub."
