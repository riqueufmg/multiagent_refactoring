    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 outgoing dependencies (AnnotationDescription, MethodDescription, TypePool, AnnotationList, TypeDescription, AnnotationValue) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Because there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing degree is small (6), this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
