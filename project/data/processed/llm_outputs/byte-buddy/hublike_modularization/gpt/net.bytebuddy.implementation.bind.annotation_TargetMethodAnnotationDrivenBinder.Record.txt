In the provided data this class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and 5 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder. Because incoming = 0 and outgoing = 5 (not a large number) the criteria for a hub-like module are not met."
