    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TrivialType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TrivialType has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct abstractions (AnnotationDescription, TypeValidation, MethodGraph, MethodAccessorFactory, ClassFileVersion, DynamicType, ConstructorStrategy) and only 2 incoming dependents (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodRebaseResolver and MethodRebaseResolver.Default). The smell 'Hub-like Modularization' requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows a moderate number of outgoing links and very few incoming links, so it does not qualify as a hub in isolation."
