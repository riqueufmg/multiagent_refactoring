    "justification": "Advice.PostProcessor has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) and 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many direct incoming and outgoing links; this class has few direct couplings. (While the two outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of Advice.PostProcessor and therefore do not indicate a hub-like smell for this class.)"
