    "justification": "FieldAccessor.TerminationHandler has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor) and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodReturn, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). These low incoming/outgoing degrees do not match the Hub-like Modularization smell, which requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
