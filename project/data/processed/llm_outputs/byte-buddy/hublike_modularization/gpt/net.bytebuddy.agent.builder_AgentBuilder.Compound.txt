    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Compound has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) and 0 incoming dependencies according to the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing links). Although the two referenced classes themselves list many dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
