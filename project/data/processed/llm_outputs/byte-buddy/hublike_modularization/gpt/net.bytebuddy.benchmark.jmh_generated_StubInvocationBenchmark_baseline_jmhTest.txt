    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_jmhType) and 0 incoming dependencies. With only a single connection to another abstraction, it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions and therefore does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
