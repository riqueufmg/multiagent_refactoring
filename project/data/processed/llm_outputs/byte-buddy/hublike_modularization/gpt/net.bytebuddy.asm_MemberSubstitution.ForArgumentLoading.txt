    "justification": "Not detected as Hub-like Modularization: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (no other abstractions depend on it) while it has 6 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies prevents this class from being a hub."
