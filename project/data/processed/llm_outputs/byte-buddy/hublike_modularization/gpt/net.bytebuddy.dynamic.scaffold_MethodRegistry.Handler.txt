    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 7 distinct abstractions (TypeWriter, InstrumentedType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, ByteCodeAppender, TypeDescription, AnnotationValue, Implementation). Incoming dependencies: only 1 abstraction (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies but a single incoming dependency, so it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
