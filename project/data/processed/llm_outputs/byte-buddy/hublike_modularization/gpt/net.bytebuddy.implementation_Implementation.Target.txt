    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Target",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited to 5 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Incoming dependencies include only a single referencing abstraction: net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. While some of the outgoing targets themselves depend on many types, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of distinct incoming and outgoing dependencies, so it does not qualify as a hub."
