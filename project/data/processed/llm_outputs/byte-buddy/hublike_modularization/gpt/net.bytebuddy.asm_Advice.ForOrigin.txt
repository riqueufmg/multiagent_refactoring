    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 9 (Assigner; AnnotationDescription; FieldAccessor; MethodDescription; ParameterDescription; JavaType; HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin; TypeDescription). Incoming dependencies: 1 (referenced by net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Although Advice.ForOrigin has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (9), it has only a single incoming abstraction (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Therefore it does not exhibit a hub-like coupling pattern."
