Direct incoming dependencies: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType (1). The class has a small number of direct incoming (1) and outgoing (4) relationships; although those related classes have many transitive dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming and outgoing dependencies required to classify it as hub-like."
