    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only 1 incoming abstraction (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder) and 2 outgoing abstractions (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although those outgoing classes list many internal dependencies, the analysis is constrained to this class in isolation, and AgentBuilder.InjectionStrategy itself directly depends on only two other abstractions and is referenced by only one—insufficient to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
