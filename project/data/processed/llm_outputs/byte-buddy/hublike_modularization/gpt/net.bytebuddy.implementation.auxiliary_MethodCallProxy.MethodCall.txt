    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.MethodCallProxy.MethodCall",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small set of direct outgoing dependencies (5: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and only one incoming dependency recorded (net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.MethodCallProxy). Because the number of distinct incoming and outgoing relationships is low, it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell (which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions)."
