    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = 0) and only two outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationSource and net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependency links; this class does not meet that criterion."
