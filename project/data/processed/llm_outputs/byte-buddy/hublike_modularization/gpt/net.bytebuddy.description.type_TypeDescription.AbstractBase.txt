    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 14 distinct abstractions (RecordComponentDescription, MethodDescription, TypeVariableSource, ModuleDescription, StackSize, PackageDescription, AnnotationList, AccessControllerPlugin, JavaType, CachedReturnPlugin, FieldDescription, TypeList, TypeDescription, ModifierReviewable). Incoming dependencies: only one abstraction (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) references this class. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here while outgoing dependencies are numerous, incoming dependencies are minimal (one), so the class does not meet the hub-like criterion."
