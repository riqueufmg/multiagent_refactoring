    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has a small set of outgoing dependencies (4) — net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility, and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph — and it has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections; here both criteria are not met (limited outgoing fan-out and zero incoming fan-in)."
