    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no classes depend on FieldAccessor.Appender). Outgoing dependencies: 5 — net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodReturn, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has only outgoing edges (five) and no incoming edges, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria. Note: while some target classes themselves have many dependencies, the analysis is limited to the class in isolation and its direct incoming/outgoing counts."
