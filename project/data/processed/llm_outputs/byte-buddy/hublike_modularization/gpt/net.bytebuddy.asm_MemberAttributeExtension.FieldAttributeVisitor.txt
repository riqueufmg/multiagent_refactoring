    "justification": "This class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; the absence of incoming dependencies means the hub criterion is not met."
