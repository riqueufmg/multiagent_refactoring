    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and a single incoming dependency source (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing counts are low (outgoing=2, incoming sources=1), so it is not a hub."
