    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (none). Direct outgoing dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class has no incoming dependencies and only three direct outgoing dependencies, so it does not qualify as a hub."
