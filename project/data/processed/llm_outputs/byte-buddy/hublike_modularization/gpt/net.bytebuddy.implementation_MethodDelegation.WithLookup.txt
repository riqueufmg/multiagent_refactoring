Outgoing dependencies: 4 direct dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only four direct outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria. (While the outgoing targets themselves show many further dependencies, the class in isolation does not have the required large number of incoming/outgoing links.)"
