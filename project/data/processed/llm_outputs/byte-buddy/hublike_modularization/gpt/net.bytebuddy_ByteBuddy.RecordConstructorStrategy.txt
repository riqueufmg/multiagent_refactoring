    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy.RecordConstructorStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has many outgoing dependencies (≈14) including MethodAttributeAppender, RecordComponentDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, MethodRegistry, Transformer, FieldDescription, JavaType, MethodReturn, LatentMatcher, ParameterDescription, ModifierContributor, AnnotationValue and others. However it has only a single incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and a large number of outgoing dependencies. The incoming count is not large (1), so this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
