    "justification": "ByteCodeAppender.Size has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Although the outgoing target (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself lists many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of ByteCodeAppender.Size in the provided data; therefore, ByteCodeAppender.Size is not a hub."
