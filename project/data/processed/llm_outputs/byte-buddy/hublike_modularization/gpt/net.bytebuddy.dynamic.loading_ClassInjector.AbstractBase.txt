    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ClassInjector.AbstractBase has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced ClassFileLocator has many dependencies (19 items listed), the analyzed class itself only depends on a single abstraction and has no incoming links, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
