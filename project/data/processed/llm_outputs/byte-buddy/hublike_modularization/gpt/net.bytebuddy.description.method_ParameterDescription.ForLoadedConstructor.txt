    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription.ForLoadedConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) itself references many other types (e.g., MethodAttributeAppender, AnnotationDescription, MethodDescription, ElementMatchers, DynamicType, TypeDescription), those are transitive dependencies of the referenced class, not direct incoming/outgoing relations of the analyzed class. Based on the provided data (no incoming dependencies; a single direct outgoing dependency), the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
