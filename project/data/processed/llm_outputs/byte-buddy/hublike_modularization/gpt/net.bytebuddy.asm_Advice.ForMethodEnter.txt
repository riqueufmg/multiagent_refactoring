    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForMethodEnter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization: it has a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) and only four direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). While those outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, the analyzed class itself has a small number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
