    "justification": "Not detected: the analyzed class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution) and 4 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided counts are low and do not meet that criterion."
