    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForWildcardBound",

    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies. (Note: net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool itself has many dependencies, but that is not the same as the analyzed class having many direct incoming or outgoing dependencies.)"
