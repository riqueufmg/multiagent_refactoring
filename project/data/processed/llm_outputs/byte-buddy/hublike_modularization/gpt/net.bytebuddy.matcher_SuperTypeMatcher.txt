    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.SuperTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: SuperTypeMatcher has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 3 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher. Per the isolation constraint, dependencies of those target classes are not considered. The class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing ties, so it is not hub-like."
