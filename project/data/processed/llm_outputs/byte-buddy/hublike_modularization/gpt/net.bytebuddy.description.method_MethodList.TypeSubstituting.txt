Outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class has no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
