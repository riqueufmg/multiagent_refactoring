    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (26 distinct outgoing dependency targets such as net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin, etc.), but the provided data shows zero incoming dependencies. Because the class lacks the required incoming dependency fan-in, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like modularization."
