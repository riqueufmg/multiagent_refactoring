    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Resolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small set of interactions: outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph) and a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph. This yields 5 distinct interacting abstractions in the provided data. Hub-like modularization is characterized by an abstraction having incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided counts are low, so the smell is not present."
