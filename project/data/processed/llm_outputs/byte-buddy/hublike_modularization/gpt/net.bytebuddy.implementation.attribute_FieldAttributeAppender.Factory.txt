    "justification": "Not detected. The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not the case here."
