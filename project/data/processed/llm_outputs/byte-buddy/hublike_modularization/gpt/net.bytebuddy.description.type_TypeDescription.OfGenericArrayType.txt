    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although that outgoing dependency itself references many types, the analyzed class does not have a large number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships required for a hub-like modularization smell."
