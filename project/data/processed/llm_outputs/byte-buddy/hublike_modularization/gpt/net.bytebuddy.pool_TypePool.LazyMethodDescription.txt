    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyMethodDescription",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although several of its outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class does not exhibit the required incoming coupling (incoming = 0), so it is not classified as a hub."
