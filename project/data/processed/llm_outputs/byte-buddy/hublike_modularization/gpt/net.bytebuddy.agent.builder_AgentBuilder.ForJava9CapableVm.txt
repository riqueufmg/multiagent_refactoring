    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; these counts are low and do not meet that criterion. (Note: the referenced dependency itself depends on many types, but the analyzed class does not have many direct incoming/outgoing links.)"
