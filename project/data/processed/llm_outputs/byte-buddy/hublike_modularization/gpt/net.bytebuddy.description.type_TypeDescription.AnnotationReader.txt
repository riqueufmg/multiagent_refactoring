    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.AnnotationReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct relationships: 5 outgoing dependencies (RecordComponentDescription, AnnotationList, AccessControllerPlugin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, JavaDispatcher) and 1 incoming dependency entry (TypeDescription). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Given only one incoming client and five outgoing collaborators in the provided data, this does not constitute a hub-like module."
