Outgoing dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependency relationships; this class has neither a large number of outgoing connections nor any incoming connections, so it is not a hub."
