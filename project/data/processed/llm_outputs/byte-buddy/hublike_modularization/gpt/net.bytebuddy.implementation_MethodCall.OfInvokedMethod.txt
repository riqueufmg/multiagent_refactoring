    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation). Although those target classes have many dependencies themselves, the class under analysis does not exhibit a high in-degree or out-degree in isolation, so it is not a hub."
