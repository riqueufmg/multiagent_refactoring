    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator) and only one incoming dependent class (net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor). Although FieldAccessor itself references many types, those references are not incoming or outgoing edges of OwnerTypeLocatable in the provided data. Because both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are very small (1 each), the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
