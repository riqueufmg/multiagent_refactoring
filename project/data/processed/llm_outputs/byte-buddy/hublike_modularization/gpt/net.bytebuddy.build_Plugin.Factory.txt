    "justification": "Plugin.Factory has only 2 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin, and only 1 incoming dependency recorded: net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin (which lists Plugin.Factory among its inner types). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; Plugin.Factory's direct coupling is limited to these two outgoing and one incoming relationships, so the smell is not detected."
