    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: none (empty). Incoming dependencies: a single incoming reference from net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; TypePool.NoOp has 0 outgoing and only 1 incoming, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria. Note: the many dependencies listed under net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool are TypePool's dependencies, not outgoing dependencies of TypePool.NoOp."
