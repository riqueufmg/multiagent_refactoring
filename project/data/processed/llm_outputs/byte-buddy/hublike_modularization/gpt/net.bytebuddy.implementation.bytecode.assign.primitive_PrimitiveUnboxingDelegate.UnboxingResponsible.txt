    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate depends on this class). Outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Both the number of incoming (1) and outgoing (2) direct dependencies are small, so the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization. Note: although TypeDescription itself lists many internal dependencies, the analyzed class only has a direct dependency on TypeDescription (counted as one outgoing), and per the isolation constraint we consider only the direct incoming/outgoing links shown."
