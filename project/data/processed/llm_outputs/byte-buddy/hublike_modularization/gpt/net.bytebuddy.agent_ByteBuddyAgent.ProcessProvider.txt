    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 0 (no outgoing dependencies listed). Incoming dependencies: 1 (only net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent depends on this class). Although net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent itself lists many dependencies (21 entries), the analyzed class has only a single incoming relation and no outgoing relations. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
