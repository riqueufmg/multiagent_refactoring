Incoming dependencies (1): net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections. While ForInstance has multiple outgoing dependencies (6), it has only a single incoming dependency in the provided data, so it does not exhibit the required many-to-many connectivity to be considered a hub."
