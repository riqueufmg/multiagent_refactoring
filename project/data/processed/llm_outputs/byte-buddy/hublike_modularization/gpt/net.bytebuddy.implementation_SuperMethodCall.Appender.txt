    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.SuperMethodCall) and 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low incoming and outgoing fan‑in/fan‑out, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
