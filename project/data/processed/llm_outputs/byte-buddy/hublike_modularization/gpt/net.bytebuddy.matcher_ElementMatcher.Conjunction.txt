    "justification": "ElementMatcher.Conjunction has only outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the low outgoing count and absence of incoming dependencies indicate this class is not a hub."
