    "justification": "Advice.ArgumentHandler does not exhibit hub-like modularization: it has outgoing dependencies to only four abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition) and only a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice. A hub-like smell requires many incoming and outgoing links to a large number of distinct abstractions, which is not the case here."
