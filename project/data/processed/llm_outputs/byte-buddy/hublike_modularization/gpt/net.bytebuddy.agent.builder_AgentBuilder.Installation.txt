    "justification": "Incoming dependencies = 0 (no classes depend on this class). Outgoing dependencies = 2 (references to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has neither many incoming nor many outgoing dependencies. Note: although one outgoing target (AgentBuilder) has many dependencies itself, that does not make the analyzed class a hub."
