    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.SimpleMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.SimpleMatcher has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming_count=0 and outgoing_count=1, so the smell is not present. Note: the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin having many of its own dependencies does not create additional direct incoming/outgoing relationships for the analyzed class."
