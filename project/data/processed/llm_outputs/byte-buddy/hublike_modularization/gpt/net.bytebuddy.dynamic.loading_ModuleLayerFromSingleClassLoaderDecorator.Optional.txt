    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.Optional",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, and only 1 incoming dependency: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. While the outgoing dependency (JavaDispatcher) itself references many types, those are transitive and not direct dependencies of this class. Based on the provided data and considering the class in isolation, it does not exhibit a high number of incoming and outgoing connections."
