    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.Configuration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single direct outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher. It has incoming references from only one class (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator). Although the outgoing target (JavaDispatcher) depends on many types, the analyzed class itself does not have many incoming and outgoing connections to a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
