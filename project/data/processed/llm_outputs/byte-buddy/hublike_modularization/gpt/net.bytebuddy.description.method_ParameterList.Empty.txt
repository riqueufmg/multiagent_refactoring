    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []) and only four outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, and net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependency relationships; the absence of incoming links and the limited number of outgoing links indicate this is not a hub."
