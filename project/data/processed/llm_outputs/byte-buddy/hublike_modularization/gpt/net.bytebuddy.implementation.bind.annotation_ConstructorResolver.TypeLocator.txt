    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.ConstructorResolver.TypeLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and it has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Here outgoing count = 2 and incoming count = 0, so it does not meet the 'large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies' criterion. Note: although the two target classes themselves list many dependencies, the analyzed class's direct coupling is small and it has no incoming links, so it is not a hub."
