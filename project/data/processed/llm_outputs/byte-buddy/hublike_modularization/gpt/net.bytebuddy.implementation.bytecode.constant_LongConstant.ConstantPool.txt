    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Incoming dependencies: 0. Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. In the provided data the class has only 3 outgoing and no incoming dependencies, so it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
