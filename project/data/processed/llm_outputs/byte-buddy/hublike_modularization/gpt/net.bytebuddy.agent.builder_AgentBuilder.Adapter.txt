    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. For net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Adapter the incoming dependency count is 0 (no incoming dependencies) and the outgoing dependency count is 1 (only depends on net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although that target class lists many dependencies, AgentBuilder.Adapter itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing links, so it is not a hub."
