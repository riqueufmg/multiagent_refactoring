    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and 5 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList. Because incoming dependencies are absent (fan-in = 0), the condition of having large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies is not met, so this is not a hub-like module."
