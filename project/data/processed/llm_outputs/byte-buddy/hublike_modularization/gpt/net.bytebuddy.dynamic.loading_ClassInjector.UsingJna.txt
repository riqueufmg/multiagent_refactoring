Outgoing direct dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and only three outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit the hub-like smell."
