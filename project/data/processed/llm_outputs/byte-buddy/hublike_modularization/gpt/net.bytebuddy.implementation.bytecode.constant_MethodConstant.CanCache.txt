    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.MethodConstant). Although MethodConstant's dependency list contains multiple types, CanCache is referenced by a single client; Hub-like Modularization requires many distinct incoming and outgoing connections, which is not the case here."
