Incoming dependencies: 2 distinct abstractions reference this class (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AssignReturned). Because the class has a modest number of direct incoming (2) and outgoing (7) relationships, it does not exhibit the high fan-in and fan-out required for Hub-like Modularization. (Transitive/deeper dependency lists of the referenced classes are not counted because the analysis considers the class in isolation.)"
