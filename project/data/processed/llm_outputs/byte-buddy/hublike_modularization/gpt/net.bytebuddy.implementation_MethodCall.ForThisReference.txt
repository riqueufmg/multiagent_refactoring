    "justification": "ForThisReference has 5 direct outgoing dependencies (Assigner, StackManipulation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation, TypeDescription) and only 1 incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall). While the referenced types themselves have many relations, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections required for a Hub-like Modularization smell (outgoing=5, incoming=1)."
