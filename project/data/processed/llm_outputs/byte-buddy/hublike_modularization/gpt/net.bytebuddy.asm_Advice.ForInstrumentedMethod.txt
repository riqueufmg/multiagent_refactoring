    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) and five outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; the provided data shows a single incoming client and a modest set of outgoing dependencies, so it does not qualify as hub-like."
