    "class": "org.gradle.work.ChangeType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ChangeType has incoming dependencies from three classes (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.IncrementalResolver, net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.IncrementalResolver.ForChangedFiles, org.gradle.work.FileChange) and has zero outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class lacks outgoing dependencies and only has a small number of incoming dependencies, so the smell is not present."
