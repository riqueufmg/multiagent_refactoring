    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.FieldAccess.AbstractFieldInstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "This class has outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing targets themselves reference many classes, the analyzed class itself has only 2 outgoing and no incoming dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
