    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ModifierAdjustment.Adjustment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here incoming_dependencies is empty and the outgoing degree (3) is not high, so the smell is not present."
