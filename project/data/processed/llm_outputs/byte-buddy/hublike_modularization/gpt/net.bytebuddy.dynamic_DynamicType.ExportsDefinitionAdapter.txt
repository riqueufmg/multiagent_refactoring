    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the two outgoing dependencies themselves reference many types, the analysis of this class in isolation shows it does not exhibit hub-like connectivity."
