    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Generalizing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced TypeDescription class lists many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing links, so the hub-like smell is not present."
