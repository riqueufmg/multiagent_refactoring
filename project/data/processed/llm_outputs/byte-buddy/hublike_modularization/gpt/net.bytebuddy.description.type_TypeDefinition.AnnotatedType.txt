Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows low in-degree and out-degree for this class. (Although JavaDispatcher itself has many dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of AnnotatedType when analyzed in isolation.)"
