    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ThreadSwitchingClassLoadingDelegate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the two referenced classes themselves list many dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing connections, so the smell is not detected."
