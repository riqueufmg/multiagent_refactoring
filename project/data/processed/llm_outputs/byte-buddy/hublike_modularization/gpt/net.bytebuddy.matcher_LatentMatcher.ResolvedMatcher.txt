    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. For net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher.ResolvedMatcher: incoming_dependencies = 0 (none). outgoing_dependencies = 4 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Because there are no incoming dependencies and only four outgoing dependencies, it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
