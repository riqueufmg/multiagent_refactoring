    "justification": "Not detected: Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Incoming_dependencies is empty and outgoing count (2) is not a large number, so the hub-like smell is not present."
