    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only a single direct outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. The hub smell requires many incoming and outgoing relationships with other abstractions; here there are not multiple direct incoming/outgoing links. (Although the referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself depends on many classes, those are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class.)"
