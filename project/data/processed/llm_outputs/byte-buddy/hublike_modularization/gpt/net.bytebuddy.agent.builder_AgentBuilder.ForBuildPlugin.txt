    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 4 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator. Although those outgoing classes themselves reference many other abstractions, the class in isolation lacks the high number of incoming and outgoing couplings required to be considered a hub."
