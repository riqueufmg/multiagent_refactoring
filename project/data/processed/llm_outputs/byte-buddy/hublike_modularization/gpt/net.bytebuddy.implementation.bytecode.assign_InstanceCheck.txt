    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. InstanceCheck has 0 incoming dependencies and only 4 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation. The lack of incoming dependencies (and the low outgoing count) indicates it is not a hub."
