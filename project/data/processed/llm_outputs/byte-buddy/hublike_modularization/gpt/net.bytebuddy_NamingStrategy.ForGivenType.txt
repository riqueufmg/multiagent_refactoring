    "justification": "The class has 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class does not meet that criterion (outgoing count = 2, incoming count = 0), so the smell is not detected."
