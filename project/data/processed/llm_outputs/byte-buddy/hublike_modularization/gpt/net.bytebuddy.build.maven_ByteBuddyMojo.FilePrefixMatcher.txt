    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator. Therefore, considered in isolation it does not exhibit hub-like modularization. (For context, the referenced types themselves have many dependencies: Plugin -> 37, ElementMatcher -> 2, ClassFileLocator -> 19, but those do not change this class's own incoming/outgoing counts.)"
