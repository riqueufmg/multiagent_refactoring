    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; these counts (incoming=1, outgoing=0) do not meet that criterion."
