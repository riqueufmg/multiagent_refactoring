    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.MethodToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited to 3 distinct abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue. Incoming dependencies are from a single abstraction: net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool (which references TypePool.MethodToken). The smell 'Hub-like Modularization' requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class has only 3 outgoing and 1 incoming connection, so it does not meet the criterion for a hub."
