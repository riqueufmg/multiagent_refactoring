    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 5 distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Incoming dependencies: only 1 abstraction (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) depends on Advice.Bound. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires having both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here outgoing degree is moderate (5) but incoming degree is low (1), so the class does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
