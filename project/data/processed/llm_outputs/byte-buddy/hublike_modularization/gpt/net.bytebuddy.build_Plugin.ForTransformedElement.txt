    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForTransformedElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Although the two outgoing targets themselves reference many other abstractions, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing direct dependencies, so it is not a hub."
