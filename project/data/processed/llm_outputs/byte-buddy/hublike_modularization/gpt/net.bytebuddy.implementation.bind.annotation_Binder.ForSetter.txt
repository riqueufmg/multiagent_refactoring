    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.ForSetter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Binder.ForSetter has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []) and only three outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Although the outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, Binder.ForSetter itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
