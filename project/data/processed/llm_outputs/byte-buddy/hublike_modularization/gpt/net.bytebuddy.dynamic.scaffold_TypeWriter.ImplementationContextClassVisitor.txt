    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced Implementation class depends on many types, those are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class and the analysis is limited to the class in isolation."
