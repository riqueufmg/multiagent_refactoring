    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. This class has outgoing dependencies to 8 distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.NullConstant, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Removal) but has 0 incoming dependencies. The absence of incoming dependencies means it does not act as a hub (no large number of incoming edges), so the smell is not detected."
