    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []) and is referenced by only one incoming abstraction (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here incoming count = 1 and outgoing count = 0, so the smell is not present."
