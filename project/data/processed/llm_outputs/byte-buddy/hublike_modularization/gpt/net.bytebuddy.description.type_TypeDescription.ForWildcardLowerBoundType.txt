Outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Although each of those two outgoing classes lists many dependencies (each ~16 listed), the analyzed class itself has no incoming relationships and only two direct outgoing relationships, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization (which requires many incoming and many outgoing dependencies)."
