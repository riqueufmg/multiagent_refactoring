    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList, net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies, it does not meet the criterion of having many both incoming and outgoing relationships and therefore is not a hub-like module."
