    "justification": "No incoming dependencies are present (incoming_dependencies = 0). While the class has outgoing dependencies to eight distinct abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription), the Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. The absence of any incoming dependencies prevents this class from being a hub."
