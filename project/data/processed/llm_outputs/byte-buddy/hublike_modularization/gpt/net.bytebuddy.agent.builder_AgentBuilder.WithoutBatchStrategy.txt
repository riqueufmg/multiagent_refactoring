    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. For net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.WithoutBatchStrategy: incoming dependencies = 1 (only net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder references it, as shown in the incoming_dependencies list), outgoing dependencies = 0 (the provided outgoing_dependencies array is empty). Because it has no outgoing dependencies and only a single incoming dependency, it does not exhibit a hub-like coupling pattern."
