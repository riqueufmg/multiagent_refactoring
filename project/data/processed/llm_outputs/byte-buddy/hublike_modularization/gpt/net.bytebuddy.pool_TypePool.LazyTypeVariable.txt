    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool) and has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming=0 and outgoing is small. Note that TypePool's many dependencies are not direct incoming dependencies of this class."
