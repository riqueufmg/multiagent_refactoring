    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although TypeResolutionStrategy has a high incoming coupling (18 distinct classes depend on it, e.g. net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Builder, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin and various Plugin/AgentBuilder/TypeWriter variants), its outgoing coupling is small (only 3 dependencies: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy.Resolved). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the dependency profile is asymmetric (many incoming, few outgoing), so the smell is not detected."
