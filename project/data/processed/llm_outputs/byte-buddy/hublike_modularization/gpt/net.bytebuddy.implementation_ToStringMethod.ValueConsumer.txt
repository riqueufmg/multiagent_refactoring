    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires the abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here, outgoing_dependencies is empty and incoming_dependencies contains a single entry (net.bytebuddy.implementation.ToStringMethod). Although that incoming class lists many dependencies, those are dependencies of ToStringMethod, not of ToStringMethod.ValueConsumer itself. With 0 outgoing and only 1 incoming dependency, this class does not exhibit a hub-like dependency structure."
