    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct relationships: 6 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.MethodComparator, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only 6 outgoing and 1 incoming reference, which does not indicate a hub."
