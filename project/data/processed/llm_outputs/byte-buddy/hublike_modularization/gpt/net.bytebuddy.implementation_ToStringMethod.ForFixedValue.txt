    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although that target class has many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing ties; therefore it is not a hub."
