    "justification": "MethodDelegationBinder exhibits hub-like modularization: it has a large number of outgoing dependencies (19) to many distinct abstractions such as MethodDelegationBinder.BindingResolver, MethodNameEqualityResolver, MethodDelegationBinder.MethodBinding, ParameterLengthResolver, MethodDelegationBinder.MethodInvoker, StackManipulation, Implementation, Assigner, MethodDescription, ArgumentTypeResolver, DeclaringTypeResolver, TypeDescription, and others. It also has a large number of incoming dependencies (32) from many different classes across the API, including MethodDelegation, MethodDelegation.ImplementationDelegate, MethodDelegation.Compiled, TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder (and its nested types), various bind.annotation binders, MethodDelegationBinder.AmbiguityResolver, Processor, and multiple helper resolvers (ArgumentTypeResolver, ParameterLengthResolver, DeclaringTypeResolver, MethodNameEqualityResolver). The presence of many distinct incoming and outgoing connections indicates this abstraction functions as a central hub, justifying detection of the smell."
