    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Incoming dependencies are empty (no classes depend on HandleInvocation). Outgoing dependencies are limited to 4 abstractions: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; HandleInvocation has zero incoming and only four outgoing, so it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
