    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing links; here incoming_count=1 and outgoing_count=0, so this class is not a hub."
