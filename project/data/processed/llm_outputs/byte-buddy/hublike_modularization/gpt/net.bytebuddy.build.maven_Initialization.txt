    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.Initialization",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Initialization has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.EntryPoint, net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ClassLoaderResolver) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo). Although EntryPoint itself depends on many types, Initialization's direct incoming/outgoing coupling is small, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
