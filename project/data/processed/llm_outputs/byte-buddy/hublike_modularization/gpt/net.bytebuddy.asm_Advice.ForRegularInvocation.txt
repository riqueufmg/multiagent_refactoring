    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForRegularInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the observed counts are small, so the smell is not present."
