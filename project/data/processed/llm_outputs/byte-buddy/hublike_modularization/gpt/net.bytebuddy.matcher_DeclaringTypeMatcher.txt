    "justification": "DeclaringTypeMatcher has only 4 direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Here the in-degree is 0 and the out-degree is small (4), so it does not meet the criteria for a hub."
