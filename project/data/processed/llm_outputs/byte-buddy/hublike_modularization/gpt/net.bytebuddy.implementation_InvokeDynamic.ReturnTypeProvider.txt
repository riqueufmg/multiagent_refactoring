    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ReturnTypeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic) and 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; these direct fan-in/fan-out counts are low. While the two outgoing dependencies themselves reference many classes, the analyzed class directly connects to only two abstractions and therefore does not qualify as a hub in the provided data."
