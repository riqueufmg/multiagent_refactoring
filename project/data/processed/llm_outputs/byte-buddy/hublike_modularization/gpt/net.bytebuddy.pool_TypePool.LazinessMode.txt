    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies = 0 (dependencies: []). Incoming dependencies count = 1 (only net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool lists a dependency on TypePool.LazinessMode). Because the class has no outgoing links and is referenced by a single class, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (i.e., it does not have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions)."
