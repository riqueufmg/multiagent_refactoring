    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies (5): net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Incoming dependencies: only 1 reported abstraction (net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall) that references this class. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing count is small (5) and the incoming count is minimal (1), so the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
