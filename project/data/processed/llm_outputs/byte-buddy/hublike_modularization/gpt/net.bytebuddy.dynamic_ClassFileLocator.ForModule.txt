    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaType, net.bytebuddy.utility.StreamDrainer) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and has only a small number of outgoing dependencies, so it does not qualify as a hub."
