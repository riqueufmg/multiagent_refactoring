    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies on two abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here there are neither a large number of outgoing connections nor any incoming connections, so the smell is not detected."
