    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess.MethodLoading",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct relations: 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess). Under the hub-like modularization definition (many incoming and outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions), these counts are low. Analysis is limited to the class in isolation and therefore the wider dependency graphs of those related classes are not considered; based on the provided data this class is not a hub."
