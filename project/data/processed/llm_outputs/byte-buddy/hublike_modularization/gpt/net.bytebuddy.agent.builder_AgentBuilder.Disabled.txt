    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Disabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Disabled has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodNameTransformer) and only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). The definition of Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows few direct connections for this class. (Note: although AgentBuilder itself is highly connected, that does not change the low number of direct incoming/outgoing relationships for AgentBuilder.Disabled when analyzed in isolation.)"
