    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected as Hub-like Modularization. The analyzed class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter) and 5 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader, net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin, net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader). Hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here the incoming degree is very low and the outgoing degree is modest, so the class does not exhibit the hub-like smell."
