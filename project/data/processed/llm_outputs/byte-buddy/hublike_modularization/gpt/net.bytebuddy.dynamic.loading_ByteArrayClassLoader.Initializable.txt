    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships; here both counts are low (outgoing=0, incoming=1), so the smell is not detected."
