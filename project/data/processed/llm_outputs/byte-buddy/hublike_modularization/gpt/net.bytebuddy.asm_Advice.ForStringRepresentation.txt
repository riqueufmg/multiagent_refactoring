    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 0 (outgoing_dependencies is an empty array). Incoming dependencies: 1 (only net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice references this class). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. In this data the class has no outgoing dependencies and only a single incoming dependency, so it does not meet the criteria for a hub."
