    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.ChildFirst",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. For ByteArrayClassLoader.ChildFirst the incoming_dependencies list is empty (no incoming links). The class has outgoing dependencies to four abstractions: ClassFilePostProcessor, PackageDefinitionStrategy, ClassLoaderDecorator, and ClassLoadingStrategy. Because there are no incoming dependencies and only four outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the 'hub-like' criterion."
