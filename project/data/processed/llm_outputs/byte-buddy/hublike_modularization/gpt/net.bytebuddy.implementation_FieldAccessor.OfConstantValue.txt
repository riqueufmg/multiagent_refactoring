    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only four outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation. Because there are zero incoming dependencies and only a small number of outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
