    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.UsingJump",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 4 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows neither condition is met. (While some of the outgoing targets themselves depend on many types, the smell is evaluated for the class in isolation and its own incoming/outgoing counts are low.)"
