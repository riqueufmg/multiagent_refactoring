    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; although the two outgoing targets themselves depend on many classes, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies (incoming=0, outgoing=2)."
