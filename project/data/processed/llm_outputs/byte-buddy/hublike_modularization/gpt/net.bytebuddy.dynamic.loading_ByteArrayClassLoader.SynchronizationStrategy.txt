    "justification": "SynchronizationStrategy has only 2 outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion, and only 1 incoming dependency: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader. Although the outgoing targets (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, ClassFileVersion) list many of their own dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships required to qualify as hub-like modularization."
