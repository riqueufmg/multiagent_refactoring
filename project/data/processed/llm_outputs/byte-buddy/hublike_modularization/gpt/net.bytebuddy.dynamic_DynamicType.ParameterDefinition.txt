    "justification": "Direct outgoing dependencies are limited to 4 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition). Direct incoming dependencies are from a single abstraction (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType). Although the outgoing targets themselves have many further dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships required to classify it as a hub-like modularization."
