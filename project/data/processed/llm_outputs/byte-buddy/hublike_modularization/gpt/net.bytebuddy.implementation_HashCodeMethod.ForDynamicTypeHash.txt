    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod). Outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). The class does not have both incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. Note: while the outgoing target classes themselves reference many types, the analysis is constrained to the class in isolation and counts only its direct incoming and outgoing dependencies."
