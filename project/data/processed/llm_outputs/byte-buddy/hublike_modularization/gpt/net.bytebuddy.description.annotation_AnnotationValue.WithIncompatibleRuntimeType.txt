    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced AnnotationValue class itself lists many dependencies, the analyzed class in isolation does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
