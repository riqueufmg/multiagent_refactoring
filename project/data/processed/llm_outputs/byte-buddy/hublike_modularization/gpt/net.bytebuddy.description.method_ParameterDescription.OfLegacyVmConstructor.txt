    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. It has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = 0) and only three direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, and net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 3, which is not a large number of connections."
