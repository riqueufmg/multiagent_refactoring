    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing direct dependencies; the provided data shows limited direct coupling. (Note: HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin lists many of its own dependencies, but those are not direct dependencies of JavaDispatcher.ForDefaultValue in the given data.)"
