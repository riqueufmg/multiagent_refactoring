    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 4 explicit outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator) and 0 incoming dependencies. While some outgoing targets (notably TypeDescription) themselves depend on many types, the class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships and therefore does not qualify as a hub."
