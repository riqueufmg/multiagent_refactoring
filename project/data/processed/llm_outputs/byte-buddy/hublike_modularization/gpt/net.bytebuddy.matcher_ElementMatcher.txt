    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ElementMatcher has a large number of incoming dependencies: many classes across packages reference it (examples include net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, and many net.bytebuddy.matcher.* classes such as ElementMatchers, LatentMatcher, MethodSortMatcher). However, ElementMatcher's outgoing dependencies are minimal — only net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin are listed as its direct dependencies. Because Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies, the provided data shows many incoming but few outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
