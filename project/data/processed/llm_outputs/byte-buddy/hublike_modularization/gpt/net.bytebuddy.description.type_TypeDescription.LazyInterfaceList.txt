    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing target (TypeList) itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing direct dependencies, so it is not a hub."
