In the provided data net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForType has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Although HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself lists many dependencies, those are not incoming to or outgoing from Plugin.ForType in the given data, so Plugin.ForType is not a hub."
