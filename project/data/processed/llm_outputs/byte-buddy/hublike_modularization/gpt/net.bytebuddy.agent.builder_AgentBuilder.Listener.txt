    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Listener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Listener has only five outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule) and a single listed incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections. The provided data shows AgentBuilder.Listener interacts with a small set of classes and is referenced by one class, so it does not meet the \"hub\" criterion. (Although AgentBuilder itself has many dependencies, those make AgentBuilder a hub candidate, not AgentBuilder.Listener.)"
