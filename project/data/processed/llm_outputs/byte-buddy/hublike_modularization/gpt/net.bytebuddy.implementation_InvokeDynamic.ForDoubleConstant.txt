    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForDoubleConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to only 3 abstractions (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming degree is zero, so the class does not meet the hub-like criteria. (Note: although TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, that reflects TypeDescription's connectivity, not many incoming/outgoing links for the analyzed class.)"
