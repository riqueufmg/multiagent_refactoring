    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization: incoming_dependencies = 0 (no incoming links) and it has only three direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
