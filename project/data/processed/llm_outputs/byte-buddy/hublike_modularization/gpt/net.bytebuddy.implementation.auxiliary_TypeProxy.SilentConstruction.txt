    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy. Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing links; this class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies."
