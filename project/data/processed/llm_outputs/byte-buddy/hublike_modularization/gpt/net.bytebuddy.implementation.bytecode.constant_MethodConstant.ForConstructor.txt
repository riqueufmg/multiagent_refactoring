    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription). Although that outgoing type lists many of its own dependencies, the analysis is limited to the class in isolation and counts only direct incoming/outgoing ties; therefore it does not qualify as a hub."
