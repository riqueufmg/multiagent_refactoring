    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct dependencies: 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList) and a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription. Although those dependent classes themselves reference many other abstractions, the Builder class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing direct dependencies required to qualify as hub-like modularization."
