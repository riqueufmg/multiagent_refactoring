    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has outgoing dependencies to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation (2 outgoing) and has no incoming dependencies (0 incoming). Because incoming dependencies are absent and the outgoing count is very small, this class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
