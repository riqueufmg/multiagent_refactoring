    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.IntegerConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IntegerConstant has 4 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation) and a single incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.DefaultValue. The counts of incoming (1) and outgoing (4) relationships are low and do not constitute \"dependencies with a large number of other abstractions.\" Although some of the outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, the smell criterion applies to IntegerConstant in isolation, and it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
