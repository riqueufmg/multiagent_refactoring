    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has many outgoing dependencies (10 distinct types: RecordComponentDescription, MethodDescription, FieldList, MethodList, ModuleDescription, RecordComponentList, PackageDescription, FieldDescription, TypeList, TypeDescription), but the provided data shows zero incoming dependencies. Because it lacks incoming dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub (which requires both incoming and outgoing relations), so the smell is not detected."
