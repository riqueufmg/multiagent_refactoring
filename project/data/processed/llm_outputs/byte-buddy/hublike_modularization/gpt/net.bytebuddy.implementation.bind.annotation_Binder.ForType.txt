    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no classes depend on Binder.ForType). Outgoing dependencies: 2 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; Binder.ForType has only two direct outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like pattern. Note: the two target classes themselves have many dependencies, but Binder.ForType's direct coupling is minimal."
