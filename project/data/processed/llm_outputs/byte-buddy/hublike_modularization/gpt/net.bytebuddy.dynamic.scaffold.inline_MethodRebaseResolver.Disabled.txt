    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription. Although MethodDescription itself lists many dependencies, those are not incoming/outgoing links of the analyzed class. Given incoming=0 and outgoing=1, this class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
