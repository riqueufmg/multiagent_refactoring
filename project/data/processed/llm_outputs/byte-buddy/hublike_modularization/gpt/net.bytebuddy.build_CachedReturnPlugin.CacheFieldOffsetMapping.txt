    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization is not detected. The class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 outgoing direct dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice). A hub-like smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, the analyzed class itself has limited direct coupling (0 incoming, 2 outgoing), so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
