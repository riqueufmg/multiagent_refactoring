    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Transformer has outgoing dependencies to 10 distinct abstractions (SafeVarargsPlugin, TypeDefinition, MethodDescription, ParameterDescription, ParameterList, ModifierContributor, FieldDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeList, TypeDescription) and is depended on by a large number of other abstractions (at least 34 incoming dependents such as DynamicType, DynamicType.Builder, DynamicType.AbstractBase, DynamicType.Adapter, DynamicType.MethodDefinition, DynamicType.FieldDefinition, DynamicType.AnnotationAdapter, MethodRegistry, MethodRegistry.Default, RecordComponentRegistry, FieldRegistry, multiple DynamicType adapters/matchers, ByteBuddy, ConstructorStrategy, DecoratingDynamicTypeBuilder, ByteBuddy.RecordConstructorStrategy, etc.). The class therefore exhibits high fan-in and high fan-out across many other classes, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
