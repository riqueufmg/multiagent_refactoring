    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have extensive incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has outgoing dependencies to 5 other abstractions (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Because it lacks incoming coupling and the outgoing set is not unusually large, it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
