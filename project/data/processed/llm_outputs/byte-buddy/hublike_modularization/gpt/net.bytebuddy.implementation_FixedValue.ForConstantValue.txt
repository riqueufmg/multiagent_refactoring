    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no incoming dependencies). Outgoing dependencies: 4 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Although some outgoing targets (notably TypeDescription and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) themselves reference many abstractions, the analyzed class has no incoming dependencies and only four outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
