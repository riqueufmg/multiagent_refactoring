    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.ClassByImplementationBenchmark_jmhType) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing links). With only a single outgoing dependency and no incoming dependencies, this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
