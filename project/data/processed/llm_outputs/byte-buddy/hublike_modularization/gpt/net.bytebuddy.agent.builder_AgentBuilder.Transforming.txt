    "justification": "AgentBuilder.Transforming has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. (The referenced HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself has 16 dependencies, but that does not make AgentBuilder.Transforming a hub in the provided, class-isolated data.)"
