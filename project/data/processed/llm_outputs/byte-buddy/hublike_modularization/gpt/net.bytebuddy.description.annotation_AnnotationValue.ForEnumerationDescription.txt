    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has outgoing dependencies to four abstractions (EnumerationDescription, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, AnnotationValue) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 4, so the smell is not detected."
