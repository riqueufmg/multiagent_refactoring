    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.FieldAccess which references FieldAccess.Defined). There are not a large number of incoming and outgoing connections; interactions are limited to its containing/related class, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
