    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.ModuleLayer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one direct outgoing dependency: net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher, and only one incoming dependency source: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator. Although JavaDispatcher itself references many types, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links involving the analyzed class. Therefore the abstraction does not have both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions and is not exhibiting Hub-like Modularization."
