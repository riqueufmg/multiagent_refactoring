    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ReceiverTypeDefinition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ReceiverTypeDefinition has only 2 direct outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription and net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition, and only 1 incoming dependency in the provided data: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType. While the outgoing targets (TypeDescription, TypeDefinition) themselves reference many types, the analysis must consider the class in isolation; ReceiverTypeDefinition's direct coupling (2 outgoing, 1 incoming) is not indicative of a hub-like modularization which requires a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies."
