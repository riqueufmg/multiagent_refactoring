    "class": "net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy.Suffixing",

    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy -> net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy.Suffixing) and 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; here the direct incoming and outgoing counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
