    "justification": "JavaDispatcher exhibits hub-like modularization: it has a large outgoing coupling (16 distinct dependencies within the provided data) including AsmVisitorWrapper, TypeWriter, MethodDescription, ClassFileVersion, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and AccessControllerPlugin. It also has very high incoming coupling — it is referenced by dozens of other abstractions across multiple packages (examples: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader and its inner types, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant and its subtypes, net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader/Writer, many net.bytebuddy.description.type and net.bytebuddy.description.module classes). This combination of many incoming dependents and many outgoing dependencies matches the hub-like modularization smell."
