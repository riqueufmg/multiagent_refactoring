    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no other abstractions depend on this class). Outgoing dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class has neither a large number of outgoing dependencies nor any incoming dependencies, so it does not exhibit the smell."
