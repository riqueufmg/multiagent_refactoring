    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 1 (net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod refers to HashCodeMethod.OffsetProvider). Outgoing dependencies: 3 (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependency relations. This class has a low number of incoming (1) and outgoing (3) dependencies, so it does not meet the criterion for a hub. (Although the outgoing targets themselves list many dependencies, the analysis is constrained to the class in isolation and counts only direct incoming/outgoing relations.)"
