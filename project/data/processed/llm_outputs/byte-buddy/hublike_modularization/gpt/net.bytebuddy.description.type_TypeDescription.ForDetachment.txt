    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TargetType, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher). Although some of those outgoing targets (e.g., HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, ElementMatcher) themselves reference many other types, Hub-like Modularization requires the inspected abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. Given the absence of incoming dependencies and the small number of direct outgoing dependencies, the smell is not detected."
