    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 1 incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTaskConfiguration) and 1 outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.Adjustment). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
