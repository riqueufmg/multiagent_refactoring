    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy.ForBootstrapInjection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections. Although the two outgoing targets themselves reference many classes, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies (incoming_count=0, outgoing_count=2), so it is not a hub."
