    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MethodGraph.Key has only four outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph) and a single incoming dependency listed (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows neither a large outgoing fan‑out nor a large incoming fan‑in for MethodGraph.Key, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
