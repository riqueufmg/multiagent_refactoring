    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeDescription.Assigner has only 1 incoming dependency (from net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and 3 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). The connectivity (1 incoming, 3 outgoing) is low and does not show dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not qualify as hub-like modularization."
