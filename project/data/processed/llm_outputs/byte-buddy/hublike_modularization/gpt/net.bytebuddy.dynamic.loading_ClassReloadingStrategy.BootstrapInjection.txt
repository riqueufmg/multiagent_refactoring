    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy.BootstrapInjection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only two outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector) and a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows limited fan-out (2) and fan-in (1), so it does not qualify as a hub."
