    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. In this analysis the class has 5 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner; net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation; net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription; net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin; net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList) and 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies, the class does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
