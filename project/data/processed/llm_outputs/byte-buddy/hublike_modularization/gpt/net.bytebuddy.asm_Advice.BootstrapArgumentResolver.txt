    "justification": "Directly referenced by only one incoming abstraction (net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice) and has three direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant). Because the class, in isolation, has a single incoming relationship and only three outgoing relationships, it does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies required to qualify as hub-like modularization."
