    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder.DelegationProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder) and eight outgoing dependencies (Assigner, AnnotationDescription, ParameterDescription, Binder, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation, TypeDescription, BindingMechanic). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing links across disparate abstractions. Here incoming coupling is minimal and originates from a closely related class in the same package, while outgoing dependencies are a limited set of domain-specific collaborators rather than a large, cross-cutting set of unrelated modules; therefore this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
