    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Given the empty incoming_dependencies and the small number of direct outgoing dependencies in the provided data, this class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
