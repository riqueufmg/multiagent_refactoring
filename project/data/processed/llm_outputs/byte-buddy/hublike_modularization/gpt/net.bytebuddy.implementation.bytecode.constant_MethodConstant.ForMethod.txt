    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.MethodConstant.ForMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 direct outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both incoming and outgoing directions. Although the outgoing target (MethodDescription) itself depends on many classes, those are second-level dependencies and do not make the analyzed class a hub. Therefore, counts (outgoing=1, incoming=0) do not meet the hub-like criteria."
