    "justification": "The class has only a single outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation) and a single incoming dependency (referenced by net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing relationships."
