    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Replacement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution) and only six direct outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant, net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement, net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
