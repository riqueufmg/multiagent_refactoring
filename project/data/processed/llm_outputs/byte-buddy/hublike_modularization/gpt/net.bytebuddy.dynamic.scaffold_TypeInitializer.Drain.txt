    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. TypeInitializer.Drain has outgoing dependencies to six other abstractions (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter, net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation, net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription) and has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Because it lacks incoming dependencies and the outgoing count is not overwhelmingly large, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
