Outgoing dependencies: only two direct targets (net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList and net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool). Although those target classes list many dependencies themselves, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies required to characterize a hub-like module. Therefore, Hub-like Modularization is not detected."
