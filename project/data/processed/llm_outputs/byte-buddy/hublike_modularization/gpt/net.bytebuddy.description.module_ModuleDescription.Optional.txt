    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher) and a single incoming dependency source (net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; this class does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing links. (Although JavaDispatcher lists many dependencies, the analysis is constrained to the class in isolation, so that does not make ModuleDescription.Optional a hub.)"
