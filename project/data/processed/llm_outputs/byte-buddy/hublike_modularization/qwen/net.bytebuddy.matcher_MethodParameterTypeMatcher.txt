{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.MethodParameterTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodParameterTypeMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher', 'TypeDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', which is not a large number of dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
