    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.RedefinitionDynamicTypeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'RedefinitionDynamicTypeBuilder' has outgoing dependencies to 21 other classes, which indicates a high number of dependencies. Additionally, it interacts with central abstractions such as 'TypeWriter', 'MethodRegistry', 'DynamicType', and 'InstrumentedType', which themselves have extensive dependency lists. This pattern of depending on many classes and interacting with core abstractions that also have numerous dependencies suggests hub-like modularization."
