{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Nexus",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Nexus' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes ('NexusAccessor', 'NexusAccessor.Dispatcher', 'NexusAccessor.CreationAction') which themselves depend on a large number of other abstractions. Although 'Nexus' itself has no outgoing dependencies, the high number of incoming dependencies from classes that are highly connected indicates hub-like behavior in terms of modularization."
