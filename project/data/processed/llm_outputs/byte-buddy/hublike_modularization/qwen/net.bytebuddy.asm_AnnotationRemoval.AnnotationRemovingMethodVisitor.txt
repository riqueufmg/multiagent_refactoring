    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ElementMatcher and OpenedClassReader) and 0 incoming dependencies. The dependency tree shows a limited scope of interactions with only a few other abstractions, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
