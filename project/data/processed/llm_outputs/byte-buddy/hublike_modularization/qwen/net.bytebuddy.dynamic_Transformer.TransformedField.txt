    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.TransformedField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.TransformedField' has only outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes ('TypeDefinition', 'FieldDescription', and 'TypeDescription') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
