    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Compound' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' has many dependencies, this does not indicate that 'Advice.Compound' itself has direct dependencies with a large number of abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a high number of direct dependencies or dependents."
