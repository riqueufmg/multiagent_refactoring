    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to AnnotationDescription, TypeDescription, ParameterDescription, and MethodDescription. While these dependency targets themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions. The lack of incoming dependencies further indicates it is not a hub-like module."
