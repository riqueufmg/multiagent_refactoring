    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfMatchedField' has only 2 outgoing dependencies ('net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it being a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
