    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForTransformedElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ClassFileVersion and DynamicType) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is not excessively large, and there is no evidence of hub-like modularization where the class would act as a central point connecting to many other abstractions."
