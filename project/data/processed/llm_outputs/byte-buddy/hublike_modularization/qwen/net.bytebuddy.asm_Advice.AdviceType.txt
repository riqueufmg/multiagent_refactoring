    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AdviceType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AdviceType' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice', which itself depends on many other classes. However, the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies from multiple sources. The definition of Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
