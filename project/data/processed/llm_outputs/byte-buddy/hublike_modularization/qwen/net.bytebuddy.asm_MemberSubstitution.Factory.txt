    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Factory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Factory' has outgoing dependencies to 14 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution'). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, the incoming dependency from 'MemberSubstitution' shows that it is also a central point of interaction, further supporting the presence of this smell."
