    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy.ForGivenType' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions nor is it depended upon by many others."
