```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForInterface",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.ForInterface' has 1 outgoing dependency and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependency is to 'MethodDescription' which itself has 22 outgoing dependencies to various classes. The incoming dependency is from 'TypeWriter' which has 68 outgoing dependencies to various classes. This pattern of having a class with dependencies that also have numerous outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as it acts as a central point connecting to many other abstractions both directly and indirectly."
