    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMatchedDynamicInvocation' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions: 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher', 'net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution', which itself depends on a large number of abstractions (as shown in the dependencies list). This pattern of having both multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
