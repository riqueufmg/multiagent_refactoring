{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.SourceEntryPrependingClassFileLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StreamDrainer, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and ClassFileLocator. While HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and ClassFileLocator themselves have many dependencies, the SourceEntryPrependingClassFileLocator only directly depends on these three classes, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
