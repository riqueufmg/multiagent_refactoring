    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ReaderFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ReaderFactory' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to core classes in the ByteBuddy library related to method descriptions, annotations, and types, which is expected for a factory class in this domain. The incoming dependencies come solely from the 'Advice' class, indicating a clear usage relationship rather than widespread dependency. This level of connectivity does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it lacks the characteristic excessive number of dependencies in both directions."
