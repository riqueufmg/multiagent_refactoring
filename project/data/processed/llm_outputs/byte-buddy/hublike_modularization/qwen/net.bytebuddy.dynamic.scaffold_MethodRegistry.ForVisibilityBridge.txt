    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.ForVisibilityBridge",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodRegistry.ForVisibilityBridge' has outgoing dependencies to 4 distinct classes ('Implementation', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'TypeWriter', 'TypeDescription') and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('MethodRegistry'). The number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates a high level of coupling, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
