{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FieldDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and FieldLocator. While HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin has many dependencies (15), this reflects its own complexity rather than creating hub-like modularization for FieldLocator.Simple. The class itself does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
