    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForAllArguments' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (10) and incoming dependencies (1), indicating it interacts with many other abstractions. This pattern of numerous dependencies suggests hub-like modularization, where the class acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
