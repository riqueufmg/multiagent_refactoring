    "justification": "The class 'FieldTypeMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher', 'TypeDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'TypeDescription' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' have many dependencies themselves, the 'FieldTypeMatcher' class itself does not exhibit a high number of direct dependencies or dependents, which is required for Hub-like Modularization."
