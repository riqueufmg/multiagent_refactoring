    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader' has outgoing dependencies to 16 other classes and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by a large number of other abstractions. This satisfies the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
