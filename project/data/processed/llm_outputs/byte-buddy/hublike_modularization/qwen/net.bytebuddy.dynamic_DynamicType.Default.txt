    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Default' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType'), which itself has a very large number of dependencies (39). This central role in both incoming and outgoing connections indicates that 'DynamicType.Default' acts as a hub, connecting to numerous other abstractions, thus fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
