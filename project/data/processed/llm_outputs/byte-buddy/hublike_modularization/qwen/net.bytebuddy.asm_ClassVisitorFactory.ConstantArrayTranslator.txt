    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.ConstantArrayTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.ConstantArrayTranslator' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'Implementation', 'TypeDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', each of which has numerous internal dependencies, but the ConstantArrayTranslator itself only directly interacts with these three. The incoming dependency is from 'ClassVisitorFactory', which also has many dependencies, but again, the ConstantArrayTranslator is only referenced by one class. Given the relatively low number of direct dependencies both incoming and outgoing, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
