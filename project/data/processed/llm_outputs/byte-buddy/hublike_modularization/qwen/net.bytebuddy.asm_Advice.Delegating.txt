    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Delegating' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'), which itself has a very large number of dependencies (69). This central role in managing or delegating across many abstractions indicates hub-like behavior where it acts as a coordination point with numerous other components."
