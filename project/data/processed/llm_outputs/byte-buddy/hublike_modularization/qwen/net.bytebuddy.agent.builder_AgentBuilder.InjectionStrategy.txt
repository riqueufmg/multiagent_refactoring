```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.InjectionStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.InjectionStrategy' has incoming dependencies from 'AgentBuilder' which depends on 139 other classes, and it has outgoing dependencies to 'ClassInjector' which itself depends on 26 other classes and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' which depends on 15 other classes. This creates a hub-like modularization as the class acts as a central point connecting to a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing."
