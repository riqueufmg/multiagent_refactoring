    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ClassLoaderHierarchyMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' has many dependencies, this does not indicate that 'ClassLoaderHierarchyMatcher' itself has a large number of direct dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
