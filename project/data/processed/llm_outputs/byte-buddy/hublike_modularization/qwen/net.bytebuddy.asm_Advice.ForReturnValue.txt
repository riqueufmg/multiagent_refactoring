    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForReturnValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForReturnValue' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'), which itself has a very large number of dependencies (75). This indicates that 'Advice.ForReturnValue' is centrally connected to many other abstractions, acting as a hub in the module structure."
