    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.NativeMethodStrategy' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency from 'AgentBuilder'. The number of dependencies is not excessively large, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous connections to other abstractions in the provided data."
