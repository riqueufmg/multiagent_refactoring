    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.UsingDirectInvocation' has a high number of incoming dependencies from the class 'AgentBuilder', which depends on 134 other abstractions. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to 'StackManipulation' and its related classes, indicating that it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of incoming and outgoing dependencies, thus exhibiting Hub-like Modularization."
