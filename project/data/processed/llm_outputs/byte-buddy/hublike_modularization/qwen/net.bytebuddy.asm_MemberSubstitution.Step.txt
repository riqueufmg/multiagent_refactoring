    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Step' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (21) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies span multiple packages including 'net.bytebuddy.utility', 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode', 'net.bytebuddy.description', 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold', and others. This wide range of dependencies indicates that the class interacts with numerous other abstractions, both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
