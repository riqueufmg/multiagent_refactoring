    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ModuleDefinition' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include 'ModifierContributor' which has further dependencies to 2 other classes, 'TypeList' which has dependencies to 10 other classes, and 'TypeDescription' which has dependencies to 51 other classes. The incoming dependencies come from 'DynamicType' which has dependencies to 64 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
