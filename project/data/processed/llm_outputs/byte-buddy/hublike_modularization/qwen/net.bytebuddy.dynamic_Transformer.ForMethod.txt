{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.ForMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Transformer.ForMethod' has outgoing dependencies to 9 distinct classes and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as 'MethodDescription', 'TypeDescription', 'ParameterList', 'ParameterDescription', and others, indicating that this class interacts with a wide range of abstractions within the system. This pattern of having numerous outgoing dependencies without incoming ones suggests hub-like behavior where the class acts as a central point interacting with many other components."
