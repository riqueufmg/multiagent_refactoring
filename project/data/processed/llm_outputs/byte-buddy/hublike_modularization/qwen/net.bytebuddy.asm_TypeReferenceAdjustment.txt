    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeReferenceAdjustment' has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes, but no incoming dependencies from other classes are present in the provided data. While it depends on multiple abstractions, the lack of incoming dependencies indicates it is not acting as a hub that other abstractions depend on. Hub-like Modularization requires significant incoming and outgoing dependencies, but this class only exhibits outgoing dependencies within the provided context."
