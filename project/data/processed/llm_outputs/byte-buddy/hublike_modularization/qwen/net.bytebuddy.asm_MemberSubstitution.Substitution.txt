    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Substitution' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive incoming and outgoing dependencies. It has a high number of outgoing dependencies (23) to various abstractions across multiple packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.utility', 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode', 'net.bytebuddy.description', and others. Additionally, it has significant incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution' which itself depends on numerous abstractions. This central role in managing substitutions with wide-ranging connections indicates hub-like behavior."
