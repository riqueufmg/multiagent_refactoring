    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForInstrumentedMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForInstrumentedMethod' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'), which itself has a very large number of dependencies (65). This indicates that 'Advice.ForInstrumentedMethod' acts as a central hub connecting numerous abstractions, both directly and indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
