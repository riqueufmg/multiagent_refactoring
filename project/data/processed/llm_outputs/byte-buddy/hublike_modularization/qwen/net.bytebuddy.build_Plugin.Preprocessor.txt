    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Preprocessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Plugin.Preprocessor' has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct classes and incoming dependencies from 0 classes. The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as 'TypeResolutionStrategy', 'DynamicType', 'ClassFileVersion', 'TypeDescription', 'TypePool', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'ClassFileLocator'. These dependencies span multiple abstraction layers and key functionalities within the system, indicating that this class interacts with a wide range of other abstractions, both in terms of quantity and diversity. This pattern of having numerous outgoing dependencies to different parts of the system qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
