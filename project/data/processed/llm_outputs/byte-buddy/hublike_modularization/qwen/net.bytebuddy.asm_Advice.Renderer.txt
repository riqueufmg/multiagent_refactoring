    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Renderer' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
