    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Identified",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Identified' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder'. The incoming dependency list shows that 'AgentBuilder' depends on many classes, but this does not indicate that 'AgentBuilder.Identified' itself has many dependencies. The class in question does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it lacks both numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies."
