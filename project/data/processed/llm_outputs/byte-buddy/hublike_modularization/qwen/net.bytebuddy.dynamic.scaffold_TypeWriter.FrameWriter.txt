    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.FrameWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter, which itself has numerous dependencies. However, TypeWriter.FrameWriter does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions nor does it have multiple incoming dependencies, thus not exhibiting hub-like modularization."
