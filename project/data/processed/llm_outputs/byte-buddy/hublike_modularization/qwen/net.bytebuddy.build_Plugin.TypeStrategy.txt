    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Plugin.TypeStrategy' has a limited number of direct dependencies (4 outgoing) and only one incoming dependency from 'Plugin'. The dependencies themselves are not indicative of hub-like behavior in isolation, as the class does not show excessive coupling or centralization within the provided data."
