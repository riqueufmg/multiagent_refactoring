    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaInstanceFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.LambdaInstanceFactory' has outgoing dependencies to 17 other classes across multiple packages. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a large number of abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies listed, but the extensive outgoing dependencies alone satisfy the criteria for this smell."
