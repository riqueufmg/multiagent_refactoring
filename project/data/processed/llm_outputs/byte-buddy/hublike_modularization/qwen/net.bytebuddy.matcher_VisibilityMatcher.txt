    "justification": "The class 'VisibilityMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'ElementMatcher', and 'TypeDescription'. While 'TypeDescription' has many dependencies itself, this does not indicate that 'VisibilityMatcher' has direct dependencies with a large number of abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies or dependents."
