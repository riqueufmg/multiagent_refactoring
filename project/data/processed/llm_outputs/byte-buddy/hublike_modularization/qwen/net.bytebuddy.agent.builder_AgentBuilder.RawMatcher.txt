    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.RawMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.RawMatcher' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from 'AgentBuilder' lists many classes but this represents a single incoming dependency relationship. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' itself has many dependencies, this does not indicate that 'AgentBuilder.RawMatcher' has direct dependencies with a large number of abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies or dependents."
