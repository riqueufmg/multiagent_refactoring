    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes, but no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires both incoming and outgoing dependencies to a large number of abstractions. The absence of incoming dependencies means this class does not act as a hub within the system."
