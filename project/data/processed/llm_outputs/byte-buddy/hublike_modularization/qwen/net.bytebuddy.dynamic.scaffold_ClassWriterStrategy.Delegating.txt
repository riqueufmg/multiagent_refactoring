{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.ClassWriterStrategy.Delegating",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypePool, ClassWriterStrategy, and AsmClassWriter, which are all directly related to its functionality as a delegating class writer strategy. The number of dependencies is not excessive for its role, and there is no evidence of it being a central hub connecting a large number of unrelated abstractions."
