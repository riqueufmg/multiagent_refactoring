    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ExceptionDefinition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ExceptionDefinition' has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList' and one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType'. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of excessive coupling with a large number of other abstractions, which would be indicative of Hub-like Modularization."
