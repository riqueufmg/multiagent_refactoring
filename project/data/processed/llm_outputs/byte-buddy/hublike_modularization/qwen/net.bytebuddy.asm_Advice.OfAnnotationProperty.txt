    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.OfAnnotationProperty' has only 6 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as hub-like modularization, especially considering the class appears to be part of a complex but well-structured bytecode manipulation library where such dependencies are expected."
