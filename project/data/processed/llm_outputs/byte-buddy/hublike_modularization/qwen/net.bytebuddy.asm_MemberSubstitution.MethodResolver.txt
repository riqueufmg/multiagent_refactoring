    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.MethodResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.MethodResolver' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution'), which itself has a very large number of dependencies (55). The analyzed class interacts with key abstractions like 'MethodGraph', 'MethodDescription', 'TypeDescription', and 'ElementMatcher', indicating it serves as a central point connecting multiple core concepts. This high number of both incoming and outgoing connections classifies it as hub-like modularization."
