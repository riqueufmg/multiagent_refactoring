    "justification": "The class 'MethodRegistry.Default' has outgoing dependencies to 15 other classes and no incoming dependencies. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
