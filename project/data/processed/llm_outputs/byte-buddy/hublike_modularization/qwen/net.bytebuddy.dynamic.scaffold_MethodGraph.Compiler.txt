    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Compiler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodGraph.Compiler' has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('MethodGraph'). The outgoing dependencies include complex abstractions such as 'MethodGraph', 'MethodDescription', 'TypeDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', indicating it interacts with a wide range of system components. Additionally, 'MethodGraph' both depends on and is depended on by 'MethodGraph.Compiler', creating a bidirectional dependency hub. This pattern of multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies with central involvement in key abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
