    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberRemoval",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'MemberRemoval' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes, but no incoming dependencies are reported. While it depends on multiple abstractions, the absence of incoming dependencies indicates it is not a central hub in the provided context. Hub-like Modularization requires significant incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not fully satisfied here."
