    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ResettableClassFileTransformer which contains 16 dependencies. While the incoming dependency has many outgoing dependencies, the Callback class itself does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it has no outgoing dependencies and only appears as a dependency target."
