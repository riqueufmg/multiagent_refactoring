    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher.ForRecordComponentToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have multiple dependencies, but the class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions nor is it depended upon by many other abstractions."
