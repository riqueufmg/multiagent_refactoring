    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Valuable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Valuable' has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class. The outgoing dependencies include 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' which itself has 15 dependencies, 'FieldAttributeAppender' which has 4 dependencies, and 'Transformer' which has 9 dependencies. The incoming dependencies come from 'DynamicType' which has 64 dependencies. This indicates that 'DynamicType.Valuable' is connected to a large number of abstractions both in terms of direct dependencies and through the dependencies of its dependent classes, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
