    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ParameterDefinition' has incoming dependencies from 1 class (DynamicType) and outgoing dependencies to 4 classes (AnnotationList, ModifierContributor, TypeDefinition, TypeList). The incoming dependency includes a large number of dependencies (49), and the outgoing dependencies also connect to multiple other classes, indicating hub-like behavior where this class acts as a central point connecting to many other abstractions."
