    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.ForAbstractMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Implementation and TypeWriter) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
