    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.SimpleParameterAnnotationAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, ParameterDescription, and MethodDescription. While these dependency classes themselves have many dependencies, the SimpleParameterAnnotationAdapter class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) to other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
