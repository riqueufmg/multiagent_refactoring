    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.AttachmentVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.AttachmentVisitor' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList', 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription', and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While these dependencies themselves have many further dependencies, the AttachmentVisitor class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies, nor does it have incoming dependencies from a large number of other abstractions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
