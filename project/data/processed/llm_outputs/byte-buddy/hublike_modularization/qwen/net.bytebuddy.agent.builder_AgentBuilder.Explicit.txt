    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and no incoming dependencies. The dependency itself has multiple outgoing dependencies, but the analyzed class AgentBuilder.Explicit does not directly depend on those classes. The number of direct dependencies (1 outgoing, 0 incoming) is not large enough to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
