{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ArrayTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ArrayTypeMatcher has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ElementMatcher and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and no incoming dependencies. The dependency HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin does have multiple outgoing dependencies (14), but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for ArrayTypeMatcher itself, as the analysis must consider the class in isolation. ArrayTypeMatcher does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
