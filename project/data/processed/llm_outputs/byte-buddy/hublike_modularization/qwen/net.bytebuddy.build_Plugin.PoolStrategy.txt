    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Plugin.PoolStrategy' has outgoing dependencies on 64 classes within the 'net.bytebuddy.pool' package, specifically the 'TypePool' and its numerous nested and related classes. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the 'Plugin' class which depends on 30 different classes including 'Plugin.PoolStrategy'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
