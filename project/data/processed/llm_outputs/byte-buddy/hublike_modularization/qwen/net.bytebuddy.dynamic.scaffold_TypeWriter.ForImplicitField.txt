    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FieldAttributeAppender, AnnotationValueFilter, FieldDescription, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While some of these dependencies have further dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies, nor does it act as a hub with many incoming dependencies."
