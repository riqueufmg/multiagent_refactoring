    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForField",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForField' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (12) and incoming dependencies (1), indicating hub-like modularization. The outgoing dependencies span multiple packages and include core abstractions such as 'FieldDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'TypeDescription', 'StackManipulation', and 'Assigner'. Additionally, it is depended upon by 'Advice', which itself has a large number of dependencies, suggesting that 'Advice.ForField' acts as a central point in the module structure."
