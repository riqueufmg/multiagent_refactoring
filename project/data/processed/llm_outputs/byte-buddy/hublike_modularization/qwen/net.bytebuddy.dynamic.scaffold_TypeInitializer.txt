    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeInitializer' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 24 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'TypeInitializer' acts as a hub connecting numerous abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
