    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Empty' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to 'MethodGraph' and 'MethodDescription', and the incoming dependency is from 'MethodGraph'. This is not a large number of dependencies, and thus does not constitute hub-like modularization."
