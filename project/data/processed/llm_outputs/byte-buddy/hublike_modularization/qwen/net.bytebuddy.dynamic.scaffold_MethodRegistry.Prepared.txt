    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodRegistry.Prepared' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
