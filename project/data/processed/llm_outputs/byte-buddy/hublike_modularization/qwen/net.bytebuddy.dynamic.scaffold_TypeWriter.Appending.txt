    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Appending' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes: TypeInitializer, ByteCodeAppender, AnnotationValueFilter, MethodDescription, TypeDescription, Implementation, and OpenedClassReader. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies (though not listed in detail) which contribute to its role as a hub. The class interacts with a large number of abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
