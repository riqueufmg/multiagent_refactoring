    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Entry' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'MethodGraph', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'Visibility', and 'MethodDescription'. The incoming dependencies come only from 'MethodGraph'. This level of coupling is not indicative of hub-like modularization, which would require dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
