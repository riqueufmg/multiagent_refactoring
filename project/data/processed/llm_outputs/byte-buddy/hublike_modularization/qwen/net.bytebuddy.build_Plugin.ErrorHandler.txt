    "justification": "The class 'Plugin.ErrorHandler' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'Plugin'. The 'Plugin' class has many dependencies, but that does not indicate that 'Plugin.ErrorHandler' itself has hub-like modularization. The class in question does not exhibit a large number of dependencies (incoming or outgoing) with other abstractions."
