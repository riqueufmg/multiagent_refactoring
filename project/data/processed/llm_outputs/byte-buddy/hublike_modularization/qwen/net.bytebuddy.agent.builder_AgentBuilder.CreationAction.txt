{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.CreationAction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.CreationAction' has incoming dependencies from a large number of abstractions within the same package 'net.bytebuddy.agent.builder', specifically from the 'AgentBuilder' class which depends on 93 other abstractions. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to 3 other abstractions: 'JavaType', 'TypeValidation', and 'ClassLoadingStrategy'. This pattern of having both numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
