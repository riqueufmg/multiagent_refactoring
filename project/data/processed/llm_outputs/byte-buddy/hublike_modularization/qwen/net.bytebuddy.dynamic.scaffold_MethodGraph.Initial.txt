    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, indicating it does not interact with any other abstractions in the system. A hub-like modularization smell requires the presence of dependencies with multiple abstractions, but this class is completely isolated with zero dependencies."
