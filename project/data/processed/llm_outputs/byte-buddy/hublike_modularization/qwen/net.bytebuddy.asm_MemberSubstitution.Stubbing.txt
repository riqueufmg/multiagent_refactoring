    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Stubbing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Stubbing' has only 4 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution'. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing."
