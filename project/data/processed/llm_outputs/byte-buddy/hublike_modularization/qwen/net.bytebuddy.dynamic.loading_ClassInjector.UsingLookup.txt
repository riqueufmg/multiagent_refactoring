    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingLookup",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ClassInjector.UsingLookup' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes: 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'JavaType', 'JavaDispatcher', 'AccessControllerPlugin', and 'TypeDescription'. Among these, 'TypeDescription' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (49), indicating it is a hub. Additionally, 'JavaDispatcher' has 19 outgoing dependencies and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' has 15, further suggesting hub-like behavior in the dependencies. The presence of such highly connected abstractions both as direct dependencies and in their own dependency structures indicates that 'ClassInjector.UsingLookup' participates in hub-like modularization."
