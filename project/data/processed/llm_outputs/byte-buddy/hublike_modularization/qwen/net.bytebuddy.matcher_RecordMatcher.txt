```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.RecordMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'RecordMatcher' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' itself has many dependencies (14), this does not indicate that 'RecordMatcher' is hub-like since we are evaluating the class in isolation based on its direct dependencies. A hub-like class would have a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing), which is not the case here."
