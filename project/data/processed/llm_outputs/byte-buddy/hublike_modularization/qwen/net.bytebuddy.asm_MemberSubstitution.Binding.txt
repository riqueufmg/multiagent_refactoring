    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Binding",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Binding' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes: 'JavaConstant', 'TypeDescription', 'ByteCodeElement', 'TypeList', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'MemberSubstitution', which itself depends on a very large number of abstractions (48 dependencies listed). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other parts of the system."
