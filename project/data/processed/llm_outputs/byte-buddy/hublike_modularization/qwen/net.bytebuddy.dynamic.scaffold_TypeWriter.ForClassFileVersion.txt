    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While these dependencies themselves have multiple dependencies, the analyzed class does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies or dependents."
