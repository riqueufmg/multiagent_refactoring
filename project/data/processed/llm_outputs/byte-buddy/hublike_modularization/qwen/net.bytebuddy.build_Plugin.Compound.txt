    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Compound' has only 2 outgoing dependencies ('net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous connections to other abstractions."
