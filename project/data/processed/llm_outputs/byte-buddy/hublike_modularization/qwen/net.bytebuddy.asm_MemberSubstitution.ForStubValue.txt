    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForStubValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForStubValue' has both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It depends on 8 different classes across various packages (outgoing dependencies), and it is also depended upon by the class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution', which itself has a very high number of dependencies (incoming dependency). This pattern of being a central point connecting many abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
