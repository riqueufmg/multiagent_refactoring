    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.ForFolder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Plugin.ForFolder' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have multiple dependencies, but the class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
