{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy.ForJnaInjection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'ClassInjector' itself has many dependencies, the 'ForJnaInjection' class does not directly depend on those. The number of direct dependencies is low, which does not indicate hub-like modularization."
