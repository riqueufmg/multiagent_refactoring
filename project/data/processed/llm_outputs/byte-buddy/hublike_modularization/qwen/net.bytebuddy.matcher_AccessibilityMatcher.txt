    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.AccessibilityMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.AccessibilityMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher', and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription'. While 'TypeDescription' itself has many dependencies, the 'AccessibilityMatcher' class does not directly depend on those. The class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction, thus it does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
