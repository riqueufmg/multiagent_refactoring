    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForThisReference",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForThisReference' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'). The outgoing dependencies include complex and central classes such as 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'MethodDescription', 'ParameterDescription', 'Assigner', 'AnnotationDescription', and 'TypeDescription', which are indicative of hub-like connectivity. Additionally, the incoming dependency from 'Advice' shows that this class is also used centrally within its module. This pattern of having multiple significant dependencies both incoming and outgoing confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
