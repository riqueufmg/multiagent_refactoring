    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to MethodDescription, which itself has many outgoing dependencies, but the class in analysis does not have a large number of direct dependencies. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it is not central in terms of incoming or outgoing dependencies within the provided context."
