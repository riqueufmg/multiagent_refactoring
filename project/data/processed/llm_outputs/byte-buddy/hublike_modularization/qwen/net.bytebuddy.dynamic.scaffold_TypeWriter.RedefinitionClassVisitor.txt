    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.RedefinitionClassVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.RedefinitionClassVisitor' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other abstractions: TypeInitializer, ModifierContributor, MethodDescription, ClassFileVersion, TypeDescription, Implementation, OpenedClassReader, and MethodRebaseResolver. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class interacts directly with a large number of other abstractions."
