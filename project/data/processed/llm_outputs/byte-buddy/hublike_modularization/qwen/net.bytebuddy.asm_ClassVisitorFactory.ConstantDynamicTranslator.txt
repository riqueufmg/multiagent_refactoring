{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.ConstantDynamicTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to distinct classes in different packages, and the incoming dependency is from a single class. This does not indicate a hub-like modularization pattern where the class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
