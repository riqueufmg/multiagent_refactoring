    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.ForField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.ForField' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to core abstractions such as 'FieldDescription', 'ModifierContributor', 'TypeDescription', 'Transformer', 'TypeDefinition', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While some of these abstractions have extensive internal dependencies, the class itself does not exhibit a high number of direct dependencies. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization, which requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies."
