    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithDrain",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.WithDrain' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'Implementation', 'AnnotationValueFilter', and 'ByteCodeAppender'. The only incoming dependency is from 'TypeWriter'. The number of dependencies is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as a hub typically interacts with a large number of other abstractions. The dependencies are also not excessively diverse in terms of packages or classes, and the class does not appear to act as a central coordinator or mediator for a wide range of other components."
