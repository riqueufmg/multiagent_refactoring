```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.ForExactType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'FieldLocator.ForExactType' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'TypeDescription', and 'FieldLocator', each of which has a moderate number of further dependencies, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class itself. Hub-like modularization requires the class in question to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
