    "justification": "The analyzed class 'net.bytebuddy.TypeCache' has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are limited to closely related classes/interfaces within the same package or directly associated packages. This level of dependency does not indicate a hub-like modularization smell, as it does not exhibit excessive or centralizing dependency relationships."
