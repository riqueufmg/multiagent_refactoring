    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Target' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (11) and incoming dependencies (1), indicating hub-like modularization. It interacts with numerous other abstractions both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it, centralizing communication and creating a potential bottleneck."
