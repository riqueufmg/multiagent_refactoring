{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.DescriptionStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.DescriptionStrategy' has incoming dependencies from 'AgentBuilder' which depends on a large number of abstractions (69 dependencies listed). It also has outgoing dependencies to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' (14 dependencies), 'TypePool' (65 dependencies), and 'TypeDescription' (62 dependencies). This creates a hub-like modularization as the class acts as a central point connecting to many other abstractions both in terms of incoming and outgoing dependencies."
