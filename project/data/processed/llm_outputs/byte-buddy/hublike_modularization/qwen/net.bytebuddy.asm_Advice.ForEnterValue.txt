    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForEnterValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForEnterValue' has both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It depends on 7 external classes and is depended upon by the 'Advice' class which itself has an extensive list of dependencies (over 150). This high number of bidirectional dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
