{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Source",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Plugin.Source' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'ClassFileVersion', 'TypeDescription', and 'ClassFileLocator'. The only incoming dependency is from 'Plugin'. This is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as the number of dependencies is relatively low and does not suggest centralization or over-coupling."
