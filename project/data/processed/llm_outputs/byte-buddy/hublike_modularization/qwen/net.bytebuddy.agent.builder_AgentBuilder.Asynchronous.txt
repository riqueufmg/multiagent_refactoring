    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Asynchronous' has only two outgoing dependencies ('TypeDescription' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous connections to other abstractions in the provided data."
