    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AbstractBase' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as hub-like modularization, especially considering the class appears to be an abstraction in a complex framework where some level of dependencies is expected. There is no evidence of this class being a central hub with numerous incoming and outgoing connections beyond what is typical for its role."
