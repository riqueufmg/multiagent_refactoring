    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.NoFolderMatcher' has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and appears in the incoming dependencies of only one class, 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin'. This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
