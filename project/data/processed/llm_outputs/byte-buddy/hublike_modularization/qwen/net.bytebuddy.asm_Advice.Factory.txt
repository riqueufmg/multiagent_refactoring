{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Factory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Factory' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, being a factory class, it is expected to have numerous dependencies, reinforcing the presence of this smell."
