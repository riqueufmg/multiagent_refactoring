    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Ignored",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Ignored' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'AgentBuilder', which does not indicate a hub-like modularization pattern. A hub-like modularization would require the class to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
