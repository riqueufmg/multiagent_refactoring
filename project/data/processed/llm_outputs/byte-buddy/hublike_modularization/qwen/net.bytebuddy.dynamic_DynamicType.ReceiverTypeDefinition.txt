```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ReceiverTypeDefinition",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ReceiverTypeDefinition' has incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType' which depends on 64 other abstractions, and it has outgoing dependencies to 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription', which depend on 11 and 64 other abstractions respectively. This creates a hub-like modularization as the class acts as a central point connecting to a large number of other abstractions both in incoming and outgoing directions."
