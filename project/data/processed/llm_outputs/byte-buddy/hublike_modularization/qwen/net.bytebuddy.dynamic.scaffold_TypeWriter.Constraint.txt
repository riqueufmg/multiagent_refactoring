    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.Constraint' has only 4 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency from 'TypeWriter'. The number of dependencies is not excessively large, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous incoming and outgoing connections to many other abstractions."
