    "justification": "The class 'ResettableClassFileTransformer' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (16) and incoming dependencies (14). It interacts with numerous other abstractions both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it, indicating hub-like modularization. The extensive dependency relationships suggest it serves as a central point in the module structure."
