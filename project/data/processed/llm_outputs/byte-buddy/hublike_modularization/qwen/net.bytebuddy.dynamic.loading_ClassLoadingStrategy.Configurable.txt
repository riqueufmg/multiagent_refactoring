    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (ClassLoaderDecorator) and 1 incoming dependency (ClassLoadingStrategy). The total number of dependencies is small, indicating it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is required for Hub-like Modularization."
