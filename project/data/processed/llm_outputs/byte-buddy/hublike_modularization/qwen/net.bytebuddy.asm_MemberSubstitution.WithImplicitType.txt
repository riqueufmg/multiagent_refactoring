    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.WithImplicitType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Assigner, AnnotationDescription, TypeDescription, and FieldLocator. While some of these dependency classes themselves have many dependencies (e.g., TypeDescription has 60+ dependencies), the analyzed class MemberSubstitution.WithImplicitType does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies nor incoming dependencies."
