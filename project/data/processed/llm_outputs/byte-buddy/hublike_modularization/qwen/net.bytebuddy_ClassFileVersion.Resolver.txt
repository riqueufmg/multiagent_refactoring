{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion.Resolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion and appears in the incoming dependencies of the same class. The dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
