    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'SafeVarargsPlugin' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 22 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions in the system, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
