{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeReferenceAdjustment.TypeReferenceAnnotationVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader and no incoming dependencies. The dependency chain shows that OpenedClassReader itself has 3 outgoing dependencies, but the TypeReferenceAnnotationVisitor class in isolation only maintains a single direct dependency relationship, which does not constitute hub-like modularization."
