    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers' has outgoing dependencies to 21 other classes and incoming dependencies from 43 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'ElementMatchers' acts as a central hub connecting numerous abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
