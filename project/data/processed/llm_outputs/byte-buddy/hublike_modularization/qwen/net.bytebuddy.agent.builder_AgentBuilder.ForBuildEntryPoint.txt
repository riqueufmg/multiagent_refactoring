    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForBuildEntryPoint",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.ForBuildEntryPoint' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.build.EntryPoint', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType'. While these dependency targets themselves have many dependencies, the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor is it depended upon by others, thus not exhibiting hub-like modularization."
