    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.ConstructorImplementation' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct classes, which in turn have numerous further dependencies, creating a wide-reaching connection pattern. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the 'AgentBuilder' class, which itself has a very large number of dependencies (over 150), indicating that 'AgentBuilder.ConstructorImplementation' is part of a highly interconnected module. The class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions across different packages, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
