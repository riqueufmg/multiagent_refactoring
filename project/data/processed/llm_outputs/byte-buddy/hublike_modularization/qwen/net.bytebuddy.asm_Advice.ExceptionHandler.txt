    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ExceptionHandler' has incoming dependencies from a large number of abstractions (as seen in the extensive list under 'incoming_dependencies', including many classes from the 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice' package) and also has outgoing dependencies to multiple abstractions across different packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Removal', 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription', 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription', and others. This pattern of having numerous both incoming and outgoing connections indicates hub-like modularization."
