    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.SelfInjection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.SelfInjection' has incoming dependencies from 'AgentBuilder' which depends on a large number of other abstractions (70+ dependencies listed). It also has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions: 'AuxiliaryType', 'DynamicType', 'TypeDescription', 'ClassInjector', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'ClassFileLocator', and 'NexusAccessor'. Each of these outgoing dependencies in turn has a substantial number of their own dependencies (ranging from 10+ to 30+). This pattern of both high incoming and outgoing dependencies with multiple abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
