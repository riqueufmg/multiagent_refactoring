    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.Dispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 15 other classes/interfaces and incoming dependencies from 1 class (ByteArrayClassLoader), indicating it acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions. The high number of outgoing dependencies (15) exceeds typical modularization thresholds, suggesting hub-like behavior where this class coordinates interactions with many other components."
