    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType.Factory' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 10 different classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 class ('InstrumentedType'), which itself has numerous dependencies. This central role in managing relationships with multiple abstractions indicates hub-like behavior where it acts as a coordination point for various components within the system."
