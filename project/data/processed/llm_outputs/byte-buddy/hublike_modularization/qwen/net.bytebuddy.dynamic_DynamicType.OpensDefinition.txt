    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.OpensDefinition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType', which itself lists many dependencies. However, the class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions directly."
