    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Loaded",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin (which itself has many dependencies) and DynamicType (which has many dependencies). However, the DynamicType.Loaded class itself does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies from other classes. The hub-like characteristic is not present at the level of this specific class."
