    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Access",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Access' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('FieldDescription' and 'JavaConstant'), which themselves have a large number of outgoing dependencies (9 and 21 respectively). Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the class 'Advice' which has a very large number of outgoing dependencies (82). This pattern of both high incoming and outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
