{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.FieldModifierTransformer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ModifierContributor, FieldDescription, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself has many dependencies (15), the FieldModifierTransformer only directly depends on these 3 abstractions, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization. The class does not show a pattern of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
