    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy.Resolved' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it interacting with a large number of other abstractions. Hence, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
