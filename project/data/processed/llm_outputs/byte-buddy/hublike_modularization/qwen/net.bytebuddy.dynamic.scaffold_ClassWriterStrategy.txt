```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.ClassWriterStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ClassWriterStrategy' has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes ('TypePool', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'AsmClassWriter'), and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes ('ClassWriterStrategy.Delegating', 'ByteBuddy'). Considering the large number of transitive dependencies through the directly dependent classes (e.g., 'TypePool' has 70+ dependencies), this indicates hub-like modularization where the class acts as a central point connecting to many other abstractions."
