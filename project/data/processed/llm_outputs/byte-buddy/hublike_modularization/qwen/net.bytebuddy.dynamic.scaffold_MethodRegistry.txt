    "justification": "The class 'MethodRegistry' has outgoing dependencies to 22 other classes and incoming dependencies from 24 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'MethodRegistry' acts as a central hub, coordinating interactions between many other components in the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
