    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.RelocationHandler' has incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice' which depends on a large number of abstractions (65 dependencies listed). It also has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions: 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'Implementation', 'TypeDescription', and 'MethodDescription'. The combination of many incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
