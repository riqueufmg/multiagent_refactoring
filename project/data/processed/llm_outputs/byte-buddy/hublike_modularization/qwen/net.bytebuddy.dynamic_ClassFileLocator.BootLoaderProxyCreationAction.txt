    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy' and is depended upon by only one class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator'. The number of dependencies is not excessively large, thus it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
