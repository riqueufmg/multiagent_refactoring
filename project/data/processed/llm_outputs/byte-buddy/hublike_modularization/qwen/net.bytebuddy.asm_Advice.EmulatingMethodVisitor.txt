{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.EmulatingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes Implementation, ByteCodeAppender, and OpenedClassReader. While the Implementation class itself has many dependencies, the EmulatingMethodVisitor does not directly depend on those, thus it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
