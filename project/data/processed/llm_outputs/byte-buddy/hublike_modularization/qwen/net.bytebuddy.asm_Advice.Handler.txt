    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Handler' has both a high number of outgoing dependencies (10) and incoming dependencies (1 from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'). The outgoing dependencies include core abstractions such as 'MethodDescription', 'TypeDescription', 'StackManipulation', 'Assigner', and 'AnnotationDescription', indicating it interacts with a wide range of system components. Additionally, it is depended upon by 'Advice', which itself has an extensive list of dependencies, suggesting 'Handler' acts as a central coordinator or hub within the module. This pattern of having many outgoing and incoming connections classifies it as Hub-like Modularization."
