    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, JavaDispatcher, AccessControllerPlugin, ClassLoadingStrategy, and TypeDescription. While some of these dependency classes have extensive dependencies themselves, the analyzed class does not show hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies nor incoming dependencies."
