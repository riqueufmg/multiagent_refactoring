    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.RecordComponentDefinition",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.RecordComponentDefinition' has incoming dependencies from a large number of abstractions (as seen in the extensive list under incoming_dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType') and also maintains outgoing dependencies to multiple external abstractions such as 'AnnotationList' and 'RecordComponentAttributeAppender', along with their transitive dependencies. This pattern of having numerous both incoming and outgoing connections indicates hub-like modularization."
