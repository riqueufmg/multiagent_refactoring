    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.ResubmissionImmediateMatcher' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from 'AgentBuilder' shows a large number of dependencies, but this reflects the complexity of the parent class, not the 'ResubmissionImmediateMatcher' itself. The 'ResubmissionImmediateMatcher' does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of dependencies in either direction."
