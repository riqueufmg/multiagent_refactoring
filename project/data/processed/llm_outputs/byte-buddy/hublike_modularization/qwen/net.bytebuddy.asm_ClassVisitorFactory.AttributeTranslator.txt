    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.AttributeTranslator' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'Implementation', 'TypeDescription', and 'MethodDescription'. The only incoming dependency is from 'ClassVisitorFactory'. This dependency profile does not indicate a hub-like structure, as the class does not interact with a large number of other abstractions either incoming or outgoing."
