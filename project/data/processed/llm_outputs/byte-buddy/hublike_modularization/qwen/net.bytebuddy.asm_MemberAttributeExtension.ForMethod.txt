    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension.ForMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions and incoming dependencies from 0 abstractions. The outgoing dependencies include core framework classes such as AsmVisitorWrapper, MethodAttributeAppender, Implementation, and MethodDescription, indicating it interacts with multiple central components of the system. This high number of outgoing dependencies suggests hub-like behavior where the class is connected to many other parts of the system."
