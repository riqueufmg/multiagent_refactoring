    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and no incoming dependencies. While the HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself has many dependencies, the ClassFileLocator.Simple class in isolation only maintains a single dependency relationship, which does not constitute hub-like modularization."
