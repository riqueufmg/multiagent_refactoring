    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension.AttributeAppendingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes AnnotationValueFilter, MethodAttributeAppender, OpenedClassReader, and MethodDescription. While some of these dependencies have further dependencies themselves, the analyzed class does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The number of direct dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
