    "justification": "The class 'LatentMatcher.ResolvedMatcher' has only outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions: 'ElementMatcher', 'FieldDescription', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'MethodDescription'. There are no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
