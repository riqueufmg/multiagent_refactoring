    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator.ModuleLayerController",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ModuleLayerController' has incoming dependencies from 'ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator' which depends on 21 other abstractions, and it has outgoing dependencies to 'JavaDispatcher' which in turn depends on 16 other abstractions. This creates a hub-like structure where the class acts as a central point connecting to a large number of other abstractions through both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
