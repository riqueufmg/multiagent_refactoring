        "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType' has a large number of outgoing dependencies (74), indicating it interacts with many other abstractions.",
        "It also has a significant number of incoming dependencies (65), showing that many other abstractions depend on it.",
        "The class serves as a central interface or facade in the dynamic type creation mechanism, interacting with various components like 'FieldRegistry', 'MethodRegistry', 'TypeWriter', 'InstrumentedType', and many others across different packages.",
        "Its central role is further evidenced by its usage in critical components such as 'AgentBuilder', 'ByteBuddy', and various auxiliary and implementation classes.",
        "This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
