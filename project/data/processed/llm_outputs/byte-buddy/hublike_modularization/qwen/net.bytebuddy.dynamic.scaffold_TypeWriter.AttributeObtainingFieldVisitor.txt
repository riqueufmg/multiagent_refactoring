    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.AttributeObtainingFieldVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader and no incoming dependencies. The dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
