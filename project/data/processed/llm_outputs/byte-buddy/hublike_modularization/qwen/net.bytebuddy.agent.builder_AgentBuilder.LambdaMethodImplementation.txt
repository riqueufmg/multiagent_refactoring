    "justification": "The class has 8 outgoing dependencies, which is not excessively high. There are no incoming dependencies. The dependencies are to well-defined utility and description classes, which is typical for this type of abstraction. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not connect to a large number of other abstractions in a centralizing manner."
