    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ClassInjector' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and the incoming dependency is from 'ClassReloadingStrategy'. This is not a large number of dependencies, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
