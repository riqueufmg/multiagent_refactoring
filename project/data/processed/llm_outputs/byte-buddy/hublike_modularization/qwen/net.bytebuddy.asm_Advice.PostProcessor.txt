    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.PostProcessor' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to a high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It has 1 incoming dependency and 2 outgoing dependencies, with the incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice' containing a very large list of dependencies (over 100), indicating extensive coupling. Additionally, its outgoing dependencies include 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', both of which also have multiple further dependencies, contributing to the hub-like characteristic where this class acts as a central point connecting numerous other abstractions."
