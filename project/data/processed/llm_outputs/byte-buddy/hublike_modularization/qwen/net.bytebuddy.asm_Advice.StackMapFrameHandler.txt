    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Advice.StackMapFrameHandler' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to AsmVisitorWrapper, ClassFileVersion, TypeDescription, and MethodDescription. The incoming dependencies come only from the Advice class. This is not indicative of Hub-like Modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
