    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithImplicitType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Advice.WithImplicitType' has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes 'Assigner', 'AnnotationDescription', 'TypeDescription', and 'FieldLocator'. While some of these dependency classes themselves have numerous dependencies (e.g., 'TypeDescription' has 60+ dependencies), the analyzed class 'Advice.WithImplicitType' does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies. Therefore, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
