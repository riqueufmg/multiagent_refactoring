    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.SinglePass' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'AgentBuilder', which itself depends on many classes. However, 'AgentBuilder.SinglePass' does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies from other classes. Hence, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
