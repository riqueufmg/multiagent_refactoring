    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Graph",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Graph' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription'. While these dependency targets themselves have multiple dependencies, the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies, thus not meeting the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
