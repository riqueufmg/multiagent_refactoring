    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.MultiReleaseAware' has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator'. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it being a hub with numerous connections to other abstractions."
