    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.WarmupStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.WarmupStrategy' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and 'JavaDispatcher', each of which has multiple further dependencies, but this does not indicate that 'AgentBuilder.WarmupStrategy' itself has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The incoming dependency is from 'AgentBuilder', which is expected given that 'WarmupStrategy' is a nested class. There is no evidence that 'AgentBuilder.WarmupStrategy' acts as a hub with numerous direct dependencies."
