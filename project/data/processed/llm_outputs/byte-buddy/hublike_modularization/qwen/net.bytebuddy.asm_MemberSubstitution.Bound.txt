    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Bound",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MemberSubstitution.Bound' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes across different packages, including 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'JavaType', 'JavaConstant', 'StackManipulation', 'MethodDescription', 'TypeDefinition', 'TypeList', and 'TypeDescription'. This indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, both in terms of the variety of dependencies and the breadth of packages involved, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
