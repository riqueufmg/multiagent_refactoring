    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Creating",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Creating' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes: 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation', 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer', and 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter'. Among these, 'Implementation' has 34 outgoing dependencies, 'TypeInitializer' has 7 outgoing dependencies, and 'AnnotationValueFilter' has 2 outgoing dependencies. The total number of transitive outgoing dependencies from 'TypeWriter.Creating' is significantly high (at least 43 direct and indirect dependencies), indicating hub-like behavior. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies, which suggests this class acts as a central hub that coordinates interactions with multiple other abstractions without being heavily depended upon itself."
