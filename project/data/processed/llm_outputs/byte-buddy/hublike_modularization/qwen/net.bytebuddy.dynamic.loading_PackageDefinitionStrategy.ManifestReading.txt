    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency and 0 incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency is to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin which has many dependencies itself, but the ManifestReading class in isolation only depends on one other class, which does not constitute hub-like modularization."
