    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.MethodReturnTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodReturnTypeMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher', 'TypeDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'TypeDescription' itself has many dependencies (39), this does not indicate that 'MethodReturnTypeMatcher' is hub-like since the metric for hub-like modularization focuses on the number of direct dependencies of the class in question, not the dependencies of its dependencies. The class does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies nor does it have incoming dependencies making it a central hub."
