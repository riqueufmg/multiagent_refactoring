    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class LatentMatcher has outgoing dependencies to 7 different classes and incoming dependencies from 34 different classes, indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of clients using it and dependencies it relies on, which aligns with the Hub-like Modularization smell."
