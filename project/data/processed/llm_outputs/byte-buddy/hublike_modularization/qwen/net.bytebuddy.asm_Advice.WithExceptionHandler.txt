    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithExceptionHandler' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'TypeDescription', and 'MethodDescription'. While these dependency classes themselves have many dependencies, the 'Advice.WithExceptionHandler' class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies, which is the core characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
