    "class": "net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy.SuffixingRandom",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to RandomString and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself has many dependencies, the SuffixingRandom class only directly depends on these two classes, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
