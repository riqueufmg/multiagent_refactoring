    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForBuildPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.ForBuildPlugin' exhibits Hub-like Modularization as it has outgoing dependencies to a large number of abstractions including 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator', 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType'. Each of these dependencies in turn has numerous further dependencies, indicating that the class is centrally connected to many other abstractions in the system, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
