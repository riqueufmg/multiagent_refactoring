{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.Entry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ElementMatcher, Implementation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and FieldDescription. While some of these dependencies have extensive outgoing dependencies themselves (e.g., Implementation has 30+ outgoing dependencies), the AsmVisitorWrapper.Entry class itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor does it have incoming dependencies from many other abstractions."
