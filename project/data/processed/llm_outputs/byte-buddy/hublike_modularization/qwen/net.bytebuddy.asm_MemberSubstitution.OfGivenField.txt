    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfGivenField' has only two outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and it does not exhibit a hub-like structure where it connects to a large number of other abstractions."
