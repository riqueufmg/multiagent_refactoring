    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.ForTopLevelType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to FieldLocator and no incoming dependencies. The dependency analysis shows limited coupling, not indicating hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
