    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Adapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Adapter' has outgoing dependencies to 34 other abstractions. This large number of dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a wide variety of other components, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. The class acts as a central point that connects to many other abstractions, both directly and through the dependencies of its dependencies, making it a hub in the modular structure."
