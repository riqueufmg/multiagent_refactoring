    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AbstractInliningDynamicTypeBuilder' has outgoing dependencies to 21 other classes across multiple packages. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies listed, suggesting it may also be a central point that other classes depend on, further supporting the presence of this smell."
