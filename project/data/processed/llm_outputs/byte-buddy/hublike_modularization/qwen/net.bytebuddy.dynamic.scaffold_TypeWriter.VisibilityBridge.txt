    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.VisibilityBridge",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes: ParameterList, ParameterDescription, MethodDescription, AnnotationValue, TypeList, and TypeDescription. Each of these classes also have extensive dependencies themselves, indicating that TypeWriter.VisibilityBridge interacts with a large number of abstractions both directly and indirectly through its dependencies. This creates a hub-like structure where this class acts as a central point connecting to many other parts of the system."
