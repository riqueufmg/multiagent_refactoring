    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AdviceVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AdviceVisitor' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes, each of which has a large number of further dependencies (e.g., MethodDescription with 23 dependencies, TypeDescription with 47 dependencies). Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the 'Advice' class, which itself depends on a very large number of abstractions (80+ dependencies), indicating that 'AdviceVisitor' is central in a highly interconnected module structure. This pattern of both high fan-in and high fan-out confirms hub-like behavior."
