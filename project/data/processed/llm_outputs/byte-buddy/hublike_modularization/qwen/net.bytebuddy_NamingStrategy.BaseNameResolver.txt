    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (TypeDescription and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 1 incoming dependency (NamingStrategy). The dependencies are not numerous enough to qualify as hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
