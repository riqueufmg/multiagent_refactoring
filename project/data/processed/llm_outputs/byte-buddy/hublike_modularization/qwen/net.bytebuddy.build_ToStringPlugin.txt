    "justification": "The class 'ToStringPlugin' has outgoing dependencies to 10 different classes across multiple packages. Additionally, some of its dependencies like 'Plugin' and 'DynamicType' themselves have extensive outgoing dependencies (29 and 54 respectively), indicating that 'ToStringPlugin' is connected to a large number of abstractions through these dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
