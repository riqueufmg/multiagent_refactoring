{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.SuperTypeLoading",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.SuperTypeLoading' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency from 'AgentBuilder'. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
