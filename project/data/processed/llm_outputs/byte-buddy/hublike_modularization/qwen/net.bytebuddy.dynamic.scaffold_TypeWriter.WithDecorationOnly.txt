    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithDecorationOnly",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 14 other classes across multiple packages. It interacts with various abstractions including AuxiliaryType, TypeInitializer, FieldDescription, MethodList, RecordComponentList, RecordComponentDescription, AnnotationValueFilter, OpenedClassReader, FieldList, ClassFileVersion, AsmClassWriter, Implementation, LoadedTypeInitializer, and TypeDescription. This wide range of dependencies indicates hub-like modularization as it connects to numerous other abstractions."
