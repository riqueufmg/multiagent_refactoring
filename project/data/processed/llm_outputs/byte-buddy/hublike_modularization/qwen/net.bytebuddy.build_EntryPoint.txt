    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.EntryPoint",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'EntryPoint' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other classes and incoming dependencies from 19 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'EntryPoint' acts as a hub connecting numerous abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
