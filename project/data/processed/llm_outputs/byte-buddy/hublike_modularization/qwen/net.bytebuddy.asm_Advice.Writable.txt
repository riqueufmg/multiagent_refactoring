    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Writable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Writable' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation'. While these dependency targets themselves have multiple dependencies, the class being analyzed does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions nor is it depended upon by others, thus not exhibiting hub-like modularization."
