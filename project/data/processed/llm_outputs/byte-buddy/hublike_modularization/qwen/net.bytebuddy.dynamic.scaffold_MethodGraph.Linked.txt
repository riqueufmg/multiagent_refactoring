    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Linked' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'MethodGraph', and 'MethodDescription'. The incoming dependencies come only from 'MethodGraph'. This level of dependency interaction does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not exhibit a high number of dependencies with many other abstractions."
