    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ClassReloadingStrategy' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other abstractions. Additionally, key dependencies like 'JavaDispatcher', 'TypeDescription', 'ClassInjector', and 'ClassFileLocator' themselves have numerous outgoing dependencies, indicating they are also central abstractions. This creates a hub-like structure where 'ClassReloadingStrategy' interacts with many parts of the system directly or indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
