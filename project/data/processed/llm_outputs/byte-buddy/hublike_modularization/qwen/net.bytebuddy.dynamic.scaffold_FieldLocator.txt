    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'FieldLocator' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 34 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'FieldLocator' acts as a hub, connecting numerous other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
