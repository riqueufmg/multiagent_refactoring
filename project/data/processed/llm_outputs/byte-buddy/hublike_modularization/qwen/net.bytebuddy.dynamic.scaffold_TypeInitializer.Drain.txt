    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeInitializer.Drain",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as hub-like modularization, especially considering the class seems to serve a specific role in type initialization draining. The dependencies are also not indicative of a central hub but rather of a class interacting with related components in the type scaffolding and implementation modules."
