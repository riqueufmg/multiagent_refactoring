    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForRegularInvocation' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes across different packages, including 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'JavaConstant', 'MethodDescription', 'Duplication', and 'StackManipulation'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the class 'MemberSubstitution', which itself has a very large number of dependencies (48), indicating that 'ForRegularInvocation' is centrally involved in interactions within the system. This high number of both incoming and outgoing connections confirms the presence of hub-like behavior."
