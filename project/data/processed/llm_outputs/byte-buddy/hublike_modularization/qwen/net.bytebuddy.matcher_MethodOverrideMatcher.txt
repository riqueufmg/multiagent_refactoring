    "justification": "The class 'MethodOverrideMatcher' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to core classes within the same package ('ElementMatcher', 'ElementMatchers') and related description classes ('MethodDescription', 'TypeDescription', 'TypeDefinition') which are essential for its functionality. There is no evidence of excessive or hub-like dependency relationships that would indicate the Hub-like Modularization smell."
