    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Simple' has only 2 outgoing dependencies ('net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as it does not exhibit a large number of interactions with other abstractions."
