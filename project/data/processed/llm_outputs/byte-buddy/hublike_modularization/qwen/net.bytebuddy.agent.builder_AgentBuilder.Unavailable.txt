    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Unavailable' has no outgoing dependencies and only receives incoming dependencies from 'AgentBuilder'. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a high number of outgoing dependencies."
