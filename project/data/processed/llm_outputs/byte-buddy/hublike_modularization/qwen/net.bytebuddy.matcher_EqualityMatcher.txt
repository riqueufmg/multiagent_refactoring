{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.EqualityMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.EqualityMatcher' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' itself has many dependencies, this does not indicate that 'EqualityMatcher' has direct dependencies with a large number of abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of either incoming or outgoing dependencies."
