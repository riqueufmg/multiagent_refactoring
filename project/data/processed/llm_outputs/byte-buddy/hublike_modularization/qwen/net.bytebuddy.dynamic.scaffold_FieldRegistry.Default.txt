        "The class has incoming dependencies from 0 abstractions, but its outgoing dependencies are numerous relative to typical modularization patterns.",
        "Several of its dependencies, such as HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and TypeDescription, exhibit extensive outgoing dependencies themselves, suggesting the class is connected to central or hub-like components in the system.",
