    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes AccessControllerPlugin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and ClassLoadingStrategy, which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the analyzed class ForUrl does not show hub-like characteristics by directly connecting to a large number of abstractions."
