    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Advice.ForDynamicInvocation' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions: 'TypeList', 'TypeDescription', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'MethodDescription'. However, it has no incoming dependencies from other abstractions. For a hub-like modularization smell, an abstraction should have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Since there are no incoming dependencies, this class does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
