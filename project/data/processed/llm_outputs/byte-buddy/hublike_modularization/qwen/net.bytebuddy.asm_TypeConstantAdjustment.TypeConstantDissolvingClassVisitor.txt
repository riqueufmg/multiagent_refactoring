    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ClassFileVersion and OpenedClassReader) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have multiple dependencies, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on those. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has a limited number of direct dependencies."
