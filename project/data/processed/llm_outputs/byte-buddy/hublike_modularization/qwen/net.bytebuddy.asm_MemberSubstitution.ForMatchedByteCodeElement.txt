    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMatchedByteCodeElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ElementMatcher, ByteCodeElement, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and MethodGraph. While some of these dependencies have further dependencies themselves, the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies. Therefore, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
