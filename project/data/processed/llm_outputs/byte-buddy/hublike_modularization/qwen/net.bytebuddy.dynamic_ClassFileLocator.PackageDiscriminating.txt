{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.PackageDiscriminating",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.description.NamedElement' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' has many dependencies, the ClassFileLocator.PackageDiscriminating class itself only directly depends on these two abstractions, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
