    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForLocalValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForLocalValue' has incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice' which contains a large number of dependencies itself, indicating significant usage. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes, which is a relatively high number, suggesting that this class interacts with many other abstractions both in terms of being used by and using other components. This pattern of having numerous incoming and outgoing connections classifies it as hub-like modularization."
