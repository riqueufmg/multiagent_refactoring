    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Resolved",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes AccessControllerPlugin and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, each of which has multiple dependencies themselves, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The total direct dependencies (2 outgoing, 0 incoming) are not indicative of hub-like modularization."
