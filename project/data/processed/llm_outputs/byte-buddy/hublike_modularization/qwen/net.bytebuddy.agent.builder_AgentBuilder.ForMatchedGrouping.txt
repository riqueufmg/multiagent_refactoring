{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForMatchedGrouping",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.ForMatchedGrouping' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'TypeDescription', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'SafeVarargsPlugin', each of which has numerous further dependencies, but the class in question does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The number of direct dependencies is relatively small, and there are no incoming dependencies indicating other classes rely on it, thus it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
