    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForOrigin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForOrigin' has incoming dependencies from 1 other class (Advice) and outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes. The class 'Advice' itself has a large number of dependencies (58), indicating it is a hub-like class that interacts with many other abstractions. Additionally, 'Advice.ForOrigin' directly depends on several core framework classes such as 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'AnnotationDescription', and 'Assigner', which are likely to be widely used across the system, suggesting that 'Advice.ForOrigin' acts as an intermediary or coordinator between multiple components, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
