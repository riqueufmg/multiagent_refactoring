{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Illegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and no incoming dependencies. The dependency analysis shows limited coupling, not indicating hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
