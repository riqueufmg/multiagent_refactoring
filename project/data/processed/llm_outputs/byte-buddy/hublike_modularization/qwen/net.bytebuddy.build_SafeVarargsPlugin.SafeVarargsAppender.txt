{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.SafeVarargsPlugin.SafeVarargsAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (MethodAttributeAppender) and one incoming dependency (SafeVarargsPlugin). The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
