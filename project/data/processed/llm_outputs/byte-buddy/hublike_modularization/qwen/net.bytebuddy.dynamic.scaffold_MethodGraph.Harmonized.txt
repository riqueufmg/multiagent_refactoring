    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Harmonized",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Harmonized' has outgoing dependencies to 22 different classes/interfaces within the 'net.bytebuddy.description.method' package and incoming dependencies from 26 different classes/interfaces within the 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph' package. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
