{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.UrlDefinitionAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes AccessControllerPlugin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and JavaDispatcher. While these dependency classes themselves have multiple dependencies, the UrlDefinitionAction class in question does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) which would indicate Hub-like Modularization."
