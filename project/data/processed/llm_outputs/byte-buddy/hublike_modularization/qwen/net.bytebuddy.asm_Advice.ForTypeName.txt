{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForTypeName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForTypeName' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice', which itself has many dependencies. However, 'ForTypeName' does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies from other classes. The smell of Hub-like Modularization is not present because the class is not a central hub with numerous connections."
