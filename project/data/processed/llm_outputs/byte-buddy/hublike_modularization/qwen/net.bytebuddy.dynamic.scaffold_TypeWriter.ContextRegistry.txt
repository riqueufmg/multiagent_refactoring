    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.ContextRegistry' has only one outgoing dependency ('Implementation') and one incoming dependency ('TypeWriter'). The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of dependencies in both directions."
