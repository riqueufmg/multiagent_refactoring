```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.DescriptorMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'DescriptorMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher', 'NamedElement', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' itself has many dependencies (14), this does not indicate that 'DescriptorMatcher' is hub-like since it only directly depends on a small number of abstractions. Hub-like modularization requires the class in question to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
