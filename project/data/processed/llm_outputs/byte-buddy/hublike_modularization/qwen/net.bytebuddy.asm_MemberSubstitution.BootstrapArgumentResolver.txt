    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.BootstrapArgumentResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, JavaConstant, TypeDescription, and MethodDescription. The only incoming dependency is from MemberSubstitution. This is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as the class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
