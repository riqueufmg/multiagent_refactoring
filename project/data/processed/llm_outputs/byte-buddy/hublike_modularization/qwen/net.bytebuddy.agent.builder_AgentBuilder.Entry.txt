{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Entry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Entry' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes ('Advice', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'LatentMatcher') and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('AgentBuilder'). The dependent class 'Advice' itself has a high number of outgoing dependencies (84), indicating it is a hub. Additionally, 'AgentBuilder.Entry' is directly involved in numerous dependencies with key framework abstractions, suggesting it acts as a central coordination point with many other abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
