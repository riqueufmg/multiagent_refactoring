    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.CircularityLock",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.CircularityLock' has only one outgoing dependency to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and one incoming dependency from 'AgentBuilder'. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing connections that would indicate hub-like modularization."
