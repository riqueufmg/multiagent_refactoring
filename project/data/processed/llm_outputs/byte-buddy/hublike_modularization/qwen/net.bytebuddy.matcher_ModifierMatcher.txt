    "justification": "The class 'ModifierMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 2 incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher', 'ModifierMatcher.Mode', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. The incoming dependencies are from 'ElementMatchers' and 'ModifierMatcher.Mode'. This is not a large number of dependencies, and therefore does not constitute Hub-like Modularization."
