    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from 1 other class and outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes. The incoming dependencies include 21 elements from ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator, and the outgoing dependencies include 5 elements from Assigner, 11 elements from ConstructorStrategy, and 19 elements from JavaDispatcher. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates Hub-like Modularization."
