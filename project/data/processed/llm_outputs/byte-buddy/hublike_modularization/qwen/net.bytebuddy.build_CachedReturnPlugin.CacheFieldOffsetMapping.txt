{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin.CacheFieldOffsetMapping",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin.CacheFieldOffsetMapping' has only 2 outgoing dependencies ('net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively small, and thus it does not exhibit hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
