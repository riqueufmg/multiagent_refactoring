    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForJavaSignature",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForJavaSignature' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice', which itself has many dependencies. However, the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies from other classes. The incoming dependencies are indirect, coming through the 'Advice' class, and not directly to 'ForJavaSignature'. Therefore, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
