    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.Record' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (19) and incoming dependencies (1), connecting to various core abstractions across multiple packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.description.*', 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.*', and 'net.bytebuddy.build.*'. This central role in managing dependencies for type writing and record component handling indicates hub-like modularization."
