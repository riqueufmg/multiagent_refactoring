    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.UsingUnsafe",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes with many internal dependencies, but this does not indicate that AgentBuilder.UsingUnsafe itself has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not act as a central hub connecting to numerous other classes."
