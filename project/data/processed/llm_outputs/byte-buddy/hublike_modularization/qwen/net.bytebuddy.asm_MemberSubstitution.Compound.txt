    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Compound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and no incoming dependencies. The dependency analysis shows limited coupling rather than hub-like modularization, as the class does not exhibit dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
