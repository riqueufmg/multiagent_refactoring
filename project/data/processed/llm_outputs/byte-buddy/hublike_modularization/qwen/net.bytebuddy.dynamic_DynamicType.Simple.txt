    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Simple",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Simple' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to multiple classes including 'net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationList' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition', each of which also have numerous further dependencies. Additionally, it has significant incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType' which itself depends on a large number of other abstractions. This pattern of both high outgoing and incoming dependency counts indicates hub-like behavior where the class acts as a central point connecting many other components."
