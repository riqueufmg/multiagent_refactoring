    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its parent class PackageDefinitionStrategy, which is not excessive. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies from multiple sources."
