    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.ForClassHierarchy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, FieldList, TypeDescription, and FieldLocator. While some of these dependencies have extensive dependency lists themselves (like TypeDescription with 60+ dependencies), the analyzed class itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it maintains a limited number of direct dependencies."
