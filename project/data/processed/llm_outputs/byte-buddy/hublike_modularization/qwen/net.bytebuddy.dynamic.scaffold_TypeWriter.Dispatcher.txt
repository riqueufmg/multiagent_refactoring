    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.Dispatcher' has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter'. The number of dependencies is not large enough to qualify as Hub-like Modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
