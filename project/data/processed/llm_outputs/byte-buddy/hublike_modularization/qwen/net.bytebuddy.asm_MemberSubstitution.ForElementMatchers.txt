    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForElementMatchers' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions: 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher', 'net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 1 abstraction: 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution'. The class 'MemberSubstitution' itself has a large number of dependencies (39), indicating it is a hub-like component that interacts with many other abstractions. This pattern of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
