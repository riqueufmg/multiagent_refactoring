{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodRebaseResolver.RebasedMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 8 other abstractions and no incoming dependencies. Although the number of outgoing dependencies is relatively high, it is the combination of both incoming and outgoing dependencies that defines hub-like modularization. Since there are no incoming dependencies, the class does not exhibit the full characteristics of a hub. However, given the constraint to consider the class in isolation and the relatively high number of outgoing dependencies, it can be considered as exhibiting hub-like behavior."
