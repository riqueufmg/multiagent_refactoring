{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Disabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Disabled' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency originates from 'AgentBuilder', which is expected as 'AgentBuilder.Disabled' is an inner class or closely related component. The number of dependencies is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as it does not exhibit a large number of interactions with other abstractions."
