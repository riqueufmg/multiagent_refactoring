{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.HasSuperClassMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'HasSuperClassMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies ('ElementMatcher', 'TypeDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions."
