    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.BootstrapMarkerAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.BootstrapMarkerAction' has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoadingStrategy' and one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder'. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and it does not exhibit hub-like modularization where a class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
