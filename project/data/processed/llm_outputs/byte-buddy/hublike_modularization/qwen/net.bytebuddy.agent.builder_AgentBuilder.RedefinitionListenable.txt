    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.RedefinitionListenable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.RedefinitionListenable' has incoming dependencies from a large number of abstractions within the 'AgentBuilder' class (as evidenced by the extensive list of dependencies in the incoming_dependencies section). Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to 'ElementMatcher' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', which themselves have further dependencies. This pattern of numerous incoming and outgoing connections indicates hub-like modularization."
