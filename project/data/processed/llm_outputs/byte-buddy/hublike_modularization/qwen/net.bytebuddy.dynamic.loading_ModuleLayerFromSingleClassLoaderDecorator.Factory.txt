    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have further dependencies, but the Factory class in question does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The class does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies nor does it act as a hub with many connections."
