    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Implementation, ByteCodeAppender, TypeWriter, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, which is not a large number of dependencies. There is no evidence of hub-like modularization based on the provided dependency information."
