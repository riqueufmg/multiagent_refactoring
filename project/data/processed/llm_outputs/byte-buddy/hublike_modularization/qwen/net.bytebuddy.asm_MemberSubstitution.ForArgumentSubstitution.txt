    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForArgumentSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MemberSubstitution.ForArgumentSubstitution' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes across multiple packages, including 'ConstantValue', 'JavaConstant', 'StackManipulation', 'Assigner', 'TypeDescription', 'TypeDefinition', 'TypeList', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies listed, suggesting this class may act as a central hub that reaches out to many other components without being heavily depended upon itself."
