{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Default' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'), which itself has a large number of dependencies (65). This indicates that 'Advice.Default' acts as a hub by connecting to many abstractions both directly and indirectly through its incoming dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
