    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ResubmissionEnforcer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ResubmissionEnforcer' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder', which itself has numerous dependencies. However, the class in question does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies from other classes. The single incoming dependency is from a class with many dependencies, but this does not make the ResubmissionEnforcer a hub."
