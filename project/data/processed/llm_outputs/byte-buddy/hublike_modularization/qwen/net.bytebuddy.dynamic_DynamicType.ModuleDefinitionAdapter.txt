    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ModuleDefinitionAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have multiple dependencies, but the ModuleDefinitionAdapter class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions."
