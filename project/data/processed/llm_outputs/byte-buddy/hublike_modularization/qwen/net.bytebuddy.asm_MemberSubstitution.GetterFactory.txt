    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.GetterFactory' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes: 'JavaType', 'ParameterDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'AnnotationDescription', and 'TypeDescription'. Additionally, it is depended upon by the 'MemberSubstitution' class, which itself has a very large number of dependencies (54). This pattern of having multiple outgoing dependencies and being a central point of dependency for a class with numerous connections indicates hub-like behavior."
