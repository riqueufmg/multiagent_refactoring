    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.ForSplitAdvice' has only two outgoing dependencies ('net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin') and no incoming dependencies. While the 'Advice' class itself has many dependencies, this does not indicate that 'AgentBuilder.ForSplitAdvice' is hub-like in its modularization, as it directly interacts with only a few abstractions."
