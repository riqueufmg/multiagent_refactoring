    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OffsetMapping",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MemberSubstitution.OffsetMapping' has outgoing dependencies to 17 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('MemberSubstitution'). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, the incoming dependency from 'MemberSubstitution' shows that it is also a central point for usage, further supporting the presence of this smell."
