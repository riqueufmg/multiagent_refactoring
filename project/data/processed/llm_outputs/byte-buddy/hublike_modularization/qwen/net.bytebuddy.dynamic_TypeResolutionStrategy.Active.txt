    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy.Active",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy.Active' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TypeResolutionStrategy', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.NexusAccessor'. While these dependencies themselves have numerous further dependencies, the direct dependency count of the class in question is low, which does not satisfy the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
