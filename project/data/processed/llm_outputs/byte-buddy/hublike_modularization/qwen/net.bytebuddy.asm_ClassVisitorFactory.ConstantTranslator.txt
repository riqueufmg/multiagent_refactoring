{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.ConstantTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to classes Implementation and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the ConstantTranslator class itself does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The incoming dependency is from ClassVisitorFactory, which has many dependencies, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for ConstantTranslator itself. The class does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies in either direction."
