    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.Dispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.Dispatcher' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its high number of outgoing dependencies (7) and incoming dependencies (1). It directly depends on multiple abstractions across different packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeValidation', 'net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher', 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType', and others. Additionally, it is depended upon by 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector', which itself has a large number of dependencies, indicating that the Dispatcher acts as a central hub in the modular structure."
