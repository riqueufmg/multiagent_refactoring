    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingReflection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ClassInjector.UsingReflection' has outgoing dependencies to 9 different classes across multiple packages, including 'TypeValidation', 'JavaDispatcher', 'ConstructorStrategy', 'AccessControllerPlugin', 'DynamicType', 'ClassLoadingStrategy', 'PackageDefinitionStrategy', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'Visibility'. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, while there are no incoming dependencies listed, the extensive outgoing connections alone are sufficient to classify this as a hub-like module based on the provided data."
