    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.SuperTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'SuperTypeMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'ElementMatcher', and 'TypeDescription'. While 'TypeDescription' has many dependencies, this does not indicate that 'SuperTypeMatcher' itself has a large number of direct dependencies or is a hub. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not interact with a large number of other abstractions directly."
