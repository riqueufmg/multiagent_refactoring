    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForSerializedValue' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes, which in turn have numerous dependencies themselves. Additionally, it is depended upon by the 'Advice' class, which has a very large number of dependencies (over 150), indicating that 'ForSerializedValue' is part of a highly interconnected module. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies confirms the presence of the Hub-like Modularization smell."
