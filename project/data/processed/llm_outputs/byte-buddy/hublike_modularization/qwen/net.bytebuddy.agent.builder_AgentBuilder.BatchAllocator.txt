    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.BatchAllocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.BatchAllocator' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'TypeDescription', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'SafeVarargsPlugin', which are specific and focused. The incoming dependencies come solely from 'AgentBuilder', which is expected given its role as a nested class. There is no evidence of excessive or widespread dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
