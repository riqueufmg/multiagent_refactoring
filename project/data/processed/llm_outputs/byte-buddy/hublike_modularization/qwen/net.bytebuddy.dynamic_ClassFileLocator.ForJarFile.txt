    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForJarFile",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.utility.StreamDrainer' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' itself has many dependencies, this does not indicate that 'ClassFileLocator.ForJarFile' has direct dependencies with those classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies or dependents."
