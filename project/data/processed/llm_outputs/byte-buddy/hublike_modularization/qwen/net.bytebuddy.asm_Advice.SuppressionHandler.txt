    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.SuppressionHandler' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to classes 'Implementation', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'StackManipulation', and 'TypeDescription'. The incoming dependencies are only from the 'Advice' class. This level of dependency does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not show a large number of dependencies with other abstractions."
