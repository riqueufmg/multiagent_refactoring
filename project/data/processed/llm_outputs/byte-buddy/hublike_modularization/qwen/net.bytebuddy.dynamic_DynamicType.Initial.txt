{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Initial",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Initial' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('TypeDefinition' and 'TypeList'), each of which has a high number of further outgoing dependencies (11 each). Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the class 'DynamicType' which itself has a very large number of dependencies (55). This pattern of both high outgoing and incoming dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
