    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForClassFileLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypePool, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and ClassFileLocator, but the class itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The dependencies it does have are limited and focused, not indicating hub-like modularization."
