    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingUnsafeInjection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions: TypeValidation, ConstructorStrategy, DynamicType, ClassLoadingStrategy, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and Visibility. Additionally, some of these dependencies like DynamicType and ClassLoadingStrategy have extensive dependency lists themselves, indicating the class is connected to a large number of abstractions through direct and indirect relationships, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
