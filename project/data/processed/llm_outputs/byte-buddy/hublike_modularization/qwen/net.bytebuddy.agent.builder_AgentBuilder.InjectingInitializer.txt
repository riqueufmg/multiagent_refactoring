    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.InjectingInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have numerous dependencies, but this does not indicate that the analyzed class has a large number of direct dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires the class in question to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
