    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.ConstructorStrategy.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.ConstructorStrategy.Default' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by a large number of abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
