    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Optional",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Optional' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to classes such as 'AnnotationList', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'Transformer', and 'FieldAttributeAppender'. The incoming dependencies come solely from 'DynamicType', which is expected given it's an inner class. The number of dependencies is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as a hub typically interacts with a significantly larger number of abstractions both incoming and outgoing."
