    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.UsingMethodHandle",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.UsingMethodHandle' has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization. Hub-like modularization typically involves a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not observed in this case."
