```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LocationStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and ClassFileLocator, each of which has multiple dependencies themselves, but this does not indicate that LocationStrategy itself has direct dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The incoming dependency is from AgentBuilder which has many dependencies, but again this reflects AgentBuilder's complexity, not LocationStrategy's. For Hub-like Modularization to be detected, the class itself should have direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
