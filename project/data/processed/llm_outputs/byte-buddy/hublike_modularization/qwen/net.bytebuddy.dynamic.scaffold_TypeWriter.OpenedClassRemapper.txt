    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.OpenedClassRemapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to OpenedClassReader and no incoming dependencies. The dependency chain shows OpenedClassReader connects to three other classes, but this does not indicate the analyzed class itself has hub-like dependencies. The class does not exhibit high connectivity with multiple abstractions directly."
