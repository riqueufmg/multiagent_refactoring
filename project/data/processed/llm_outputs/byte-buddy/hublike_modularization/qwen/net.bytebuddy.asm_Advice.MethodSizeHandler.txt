    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.MethodSizeHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.MethodSizeHandler' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its high number of dependencies. It has 1 outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription', which itself has 22 dependencies. Additionally, it has 1 incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice', which depends on 134 other classes. This pattern of having numerous incoming and outgoing connections indicates that the class acts as a hub within the module, connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
