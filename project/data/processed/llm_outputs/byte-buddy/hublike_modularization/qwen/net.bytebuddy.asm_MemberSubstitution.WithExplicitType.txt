    "justification": "The class has only 5 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FieldLocator, Assigner, TypeDescription, AnnotationDescription, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, which are all directly related to its functionality. There is no evidence of excessive dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
