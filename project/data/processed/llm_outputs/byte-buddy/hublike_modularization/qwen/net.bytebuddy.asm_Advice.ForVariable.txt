    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForVariable' has incoming dependencies from 1 class and outgoing dependencies to 4 classes. The incoming dependencies include a large number of dependencies (85) from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice', and the outgoing dependencies include 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition' with 11 dependencies, 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' with 14 dependencies, and 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation' with 5 dependencies. This pattern of having both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates Hub-like Modularization."
