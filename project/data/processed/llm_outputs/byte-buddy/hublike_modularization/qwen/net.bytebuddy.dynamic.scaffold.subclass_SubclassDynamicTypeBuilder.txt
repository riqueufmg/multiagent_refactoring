    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.SubclassDynamicTypeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'SubclassDynamicTypeBuilder' has outgoing dependencies to 23 other abstractions. This high number of dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other components, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies listed, but the large number of outgoing dependencies alone is sufficient to classify this as hub-like modularization."
