    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.Explicit' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While these dependency targets themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor is it depended upon by many other abstractions. Hub-like Modularization requires the class in question to have many direct dependencies or dependents, which is not the case here."
