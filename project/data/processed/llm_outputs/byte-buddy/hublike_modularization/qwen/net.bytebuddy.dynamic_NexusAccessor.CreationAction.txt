    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to core classes within the same package and related packages, and the incoming dependency is from a closely related class. The dependencies do not indicate a hub-like pattern where the class acts as a central point connecting a large number of other abstractions."
