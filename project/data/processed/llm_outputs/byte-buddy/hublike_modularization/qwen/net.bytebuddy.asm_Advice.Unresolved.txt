{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Unresolved",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Unresolved' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice') which itself has a very large number of dependencies (75). This indicates that 'Advice.Unresolved' acts as a hub, connecting to many abstractions both directly and indirectly through its incoming dependency. The high number of outgoing dependencies combined with being a key dependency for a class with numerous connections confirms Hub-like Modularization."
