{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AssignReturned",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.AssignReturned' has incoming dependencies from a large number of abstractions (as seen in the extensive list under 'incoming_dependencies' from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'), and it also has outgoing dependencies to 11 other abstractions. This pattern of having both numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, where the class acts as a central hub connecting many other components."
