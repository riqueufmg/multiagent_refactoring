{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.CodePreservingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes Implementation, OpenedClassReader, and MethodRebaseResolver, which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the TypeWriter.CodePreservingMethodVisitor does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions. The lack of incoming dependencies also indicates it is not a central hub in the modularization structure."
