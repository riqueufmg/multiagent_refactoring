    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.SubclassImplementationTarget.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation' and 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph', each of which has multiple further dependencies, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class itself. The class does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) to qualify as hub-like."
