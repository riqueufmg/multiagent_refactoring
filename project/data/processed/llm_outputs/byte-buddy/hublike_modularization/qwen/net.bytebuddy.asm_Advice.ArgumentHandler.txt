    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ArgumentHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ArgumentHandler' has incoming dependencies from a large number of abstractions (as seen in the extensive list under 'incoming_dependencies' from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice' and others), and it also has outgoing dependencies to multiple abstractions such as 'TypeDefinition', 'StackSize', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'MethodDescription'. This pattern of having both numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
