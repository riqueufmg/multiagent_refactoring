    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to AnnotationDescription and MethodDescription, each of which has multiple further dependencies, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class itself. The class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
