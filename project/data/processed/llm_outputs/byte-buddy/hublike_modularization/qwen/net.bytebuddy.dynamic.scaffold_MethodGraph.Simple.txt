{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have multiple further dependencies, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies, which would be indicative of hub-like modularization."
