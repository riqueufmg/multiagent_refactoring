```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Sort",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution' shows a high number of dependencies (65), but these are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class 'MemberSubstitution.Sort'. The outgoing dependencies are to 'JavaConstant' (26 dependencies) and 'ByteCodeElement' (5 dependencies), which indicates moderate coupling rather than hub-like modularization. For hub-like modularization, the class itself should have a large number of direct dependencies, which is not the case here."
