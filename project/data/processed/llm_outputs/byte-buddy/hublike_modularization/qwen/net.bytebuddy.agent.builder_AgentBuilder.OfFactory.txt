    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.OfFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While these dependency targets themselves have many further dependencies, the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies, which is required for Hub-like Modularization."
