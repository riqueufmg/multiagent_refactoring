    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.SerializationImplementation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.SerializationImplementation' has outgoing dependencies to 9 distinct classes across different packages. Additionally, the outgoing dependencies themselves have further dependencies resulting in a large number of total dependencies. For example, 'JavaConstant' depends on 26 other classes, 'TypeDescription' on 51 other classes, and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' on 16 other classes. This creates a hub-like structure where the analyzed class is connected to a large number of abstractions through direct and indirect dependencies."
