    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.StringMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class StringMatcher has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency from ElementMatchers. While ElementMatchers shows high connectivity by depending on many classes including StringMatcher, the StringMatcher itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it maintains a limited number of direct dependencies and is not central to a large number of abstractions in the provided context."
