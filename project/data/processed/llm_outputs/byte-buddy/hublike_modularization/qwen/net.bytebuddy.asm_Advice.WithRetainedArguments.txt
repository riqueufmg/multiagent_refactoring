    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to MethodDescription, which itself has many outgoing dependencies, but the class itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependencies list is empty, indicating no other classes depend on it. The outgoing dependencies are limited to a single class, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
