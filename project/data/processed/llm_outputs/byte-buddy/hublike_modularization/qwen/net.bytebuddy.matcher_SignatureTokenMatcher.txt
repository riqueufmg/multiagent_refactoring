    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.SignatureTokenMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'SignatureTokenMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'MethodDescription', which are not numerous enough to indicate hub-like modularization. None of these dependencies show a pattern of excessive coupling that would suggest the class acts as a hub within the system."
