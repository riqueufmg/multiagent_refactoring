    "justification": "The class 'Plugin.WithThrowawayExecutorService' has only one outgoing dependency to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and one incoming dependency from 'Plugin'. The number of dependencies is not excessively large, and there is no evidence of hub-like modularization based on the provided data."
