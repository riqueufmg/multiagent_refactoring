    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.RecordComponentPool",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.RecordComponentPool' has outgoing dependencies to 4 distinct classes: 'RecordComponentAttributeAppender', 'AnnotationValueFilter', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'RecordComponentDescription'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the 'TypeWriter' class, which depends on 60 different classes, indicating that 'TypeWriter.RecordComponentPool' is part of a highly interconnected module. The combination of multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies suggests hub-like modularization."
