    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher.Resolved' has only outgoing dependencies to 2 other abstractions ('net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
