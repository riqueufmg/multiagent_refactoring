    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TargetType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.TargetType' has outgoing dependencies to 1 class and incoming dependencies from 13 classes. The outgoing dependency is to 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription', which itself has a large number of dependencies. The incoming dependencies come from multiple classes across different packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType', 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.Builder', 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType', and 'net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy', among others. This pattern of having numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'TargetType' acts as a hub connecting various parts of the system, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
