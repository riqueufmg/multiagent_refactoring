    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.LocalVariableTracingMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to OpenedClassReader and no incoming dependencies. The dependency chain shows OpenedClassReader depends on 3 other classes, but these are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal dependencies rather than dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
