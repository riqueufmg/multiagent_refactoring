    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency itself has multiple dependencies but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class. The class does not show excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize hub-like modularization."
