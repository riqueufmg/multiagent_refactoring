    "justification": "The class 'ErasureMatcher' has only 2 outgoing dependencies ('ElementMatcher' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it being a central hub connecting a large number of abstractions."
