    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Resolved",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Resolved' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has 12 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice', which itself has a very large number of dependencies (89). This indicates that 'Advice.Resolved' acts as a central hub connecting numerous abstractions, both in terms of outgoing connections to various utility and description classes and incoming connections from a highly connected class like 'Advice'."
