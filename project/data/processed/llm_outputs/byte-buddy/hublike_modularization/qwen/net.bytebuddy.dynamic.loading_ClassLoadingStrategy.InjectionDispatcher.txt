    "justification": "The class 'ClassLoadingStrategy.InjectionDispatcher' has only 5 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it being a central hub with numerous connections to other abstractions in the provided data."
