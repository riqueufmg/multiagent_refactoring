    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Advice.ForDefaultValues' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes ('JavaConstant', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'MethodDescription'), each of which has a large number of further dependencies (e.g., 'JavaConstant' depends on 26 other classes, 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' on 16, and 'MethodDescription' on 24). Additionally, it has significant incoming dependencies from the 'Advice' class, which depends on 109 other classes, indicating that 'Advice.ForDefaultValues' is centrally involved in a dense network of dependencies both in terms of what it uses and what uses it."
