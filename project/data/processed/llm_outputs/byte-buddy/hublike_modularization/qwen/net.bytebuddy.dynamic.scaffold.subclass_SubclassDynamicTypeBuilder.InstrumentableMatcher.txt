{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.SubclassDynamicTypeBuilder.InstrumentableMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin (which itself has many dependencies) and LatentMatcher. The incoming dependency is from SubclassDynamicTypeBuilder which has many dependencies but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for InstrumentableMatcher itself. For hub-like modularization, the class should have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly, which is not the case here."
