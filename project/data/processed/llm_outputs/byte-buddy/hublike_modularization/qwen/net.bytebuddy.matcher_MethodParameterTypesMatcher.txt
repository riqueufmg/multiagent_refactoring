    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.MethodParameterTypesMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodParameterTypesMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher', 'TypeDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'TypeDescription' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' have many dependencies themselves, the 'MethodParameterTypesMatcher' class itself does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies, nor does it act as a hub connecting to numerous other abstractions. Therefore, it does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
