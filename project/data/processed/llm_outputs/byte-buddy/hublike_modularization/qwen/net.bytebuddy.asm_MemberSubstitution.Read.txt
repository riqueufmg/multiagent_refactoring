    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Read",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to distinct abstractions, but the total count is not high enough to qualify as hub-like modularization. None of the dependencies themselves show excessive incoming or outgoing connections within the provided data that would indicate the class acts as a hub."
