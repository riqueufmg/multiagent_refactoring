    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Delegator' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 4 classes, which in turn have numerous further dependencies. Additionally, it is depended upon by the 'Advice' class, which itself has a very large number of dependencies (over 150). This central position with many incoming and outgoing connections indicates hub-like behavior."
