{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.TypeCache.LookupKey",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class TypeCache, which is expected for an inner class. The incoming dependency shows TypeCache uses LookupKey along with other related classes (CachedReturnPlugin, TypeCache.Sort, TypeCache.StorageKey) but this represents normal usage patterns rather than hub-like modularization since LookupKey itself does not depend on numerous other abstractions."
