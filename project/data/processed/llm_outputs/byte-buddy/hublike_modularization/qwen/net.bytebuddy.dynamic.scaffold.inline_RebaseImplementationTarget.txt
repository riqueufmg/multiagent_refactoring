    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.RebaseImplementationTarget",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'RebaseImplementationTarget' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include central classes such as 'MethodGraph', 'TypeDescription', 'Implementation', and 'MethodRebaseResolver', which are foundational to the ByteBuddy library's type manipulation and method handling. The incoming dependencies come from 'TypeWriter' and 'TypeWriter.Default', both of which are core components responsible for generating and writing bytecode. This pattern of having numerous outgoing and incoming dependencies with key abstractions indicates that 'RebaseImplementationTarget' acts as a hub, coordinating interactions between multiple core components."
