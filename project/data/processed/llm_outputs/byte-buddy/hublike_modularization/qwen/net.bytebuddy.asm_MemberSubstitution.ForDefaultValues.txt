    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForDefaultValues' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 4 classes, which in turn have numerous further dependencies. Additionally, it is depended upon by 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution', which itself has a very large number of dependencies (55). This pattern of having both high outgoing and incoming dependency connections indicates hub-like behavior where the class acts as a central point connecting many other abstractions."
