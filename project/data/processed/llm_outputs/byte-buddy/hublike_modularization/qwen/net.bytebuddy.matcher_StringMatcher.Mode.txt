    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from StringMatcher class. The incoming dependency shows StringMatcher depends on StringMatcher.Mode, which is expected for an inner class pattern. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it has minimal dependencies."
