        "The class has 11 outgoing dependencies, which is a high number indicating broad interaction with other abstractions.",
        "The dependencies span multiple packages including 'net.bytebuddy.build', 'net.bytebuddy.utility', 'net.bytebuddy.description', and 'net.bytebuddy.implementation', showing wide-ranging connections.",
        "Several of its dependencies like 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', and 'JavaConstant' have extensive dependency lists themselves, suggesting the class interacts with complex and central abstractions.",
        "There are no incoming dependencies listed, but the high number of outgoing dependencies already indicates hub-like behavior by connecting to many other components."
