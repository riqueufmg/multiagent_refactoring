```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AndroidDescriptor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AndroidDescriptor' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes and incoming dependencies from 4 classes. The outgoing dependency to 'TypeDescription' has 47 dependencies, and the incoming dependencies from classes like 'ByteBuddyAndroidService' list 'AndroidDescriptor' among 11 dependencies. This pattern of having multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
