    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypeDescription and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, which themselves have many dependencies, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on those numerous classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
