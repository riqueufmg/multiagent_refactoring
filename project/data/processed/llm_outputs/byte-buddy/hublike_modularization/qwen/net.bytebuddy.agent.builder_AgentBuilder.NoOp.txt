    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.NoOp' has only 2 outgoing dependencies ('ClassFileLocator' and 'DynamicType') and 1 incoming dependency from 'AgentBuilder'. The number of dependencies is not excessively high, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous incoming and outgoing connections to many other abstractions."
