    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForAdvice",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForAdvice' has incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice') and outgoing dependencies to 5 classes. The incoming dependency class itself has a large number of dependencies (50), indicating it is a hub. The outgoing dependencies include central classes like 'MethodDescription', 'TypeDescription', and 'StackSize', which are likely to be widely used. The class acts as a bridge between different parts of the system by depending on multiple abstractions and being depended upon by a hub class."
