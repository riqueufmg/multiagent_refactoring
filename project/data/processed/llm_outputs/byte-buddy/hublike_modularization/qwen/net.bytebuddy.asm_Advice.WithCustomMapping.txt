    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithCustomMapping' has outgoing dependencies to 14 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'). This indicates it acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, both consuming and being consumed by a wide range of other components, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
