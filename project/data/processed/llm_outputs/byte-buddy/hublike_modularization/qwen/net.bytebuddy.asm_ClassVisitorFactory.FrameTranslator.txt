    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.FrameTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to Implementation, TypeDescription, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, which are core abstractions but not excessive. The incoming dependency is only from ClassVisitorFactory. The dependency counts and relationships do not indicate hub-like characteristics where the class would act as a central hub with numerous dependencies in both directions."
