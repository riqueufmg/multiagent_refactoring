    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.CollectionSizeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.CollectionSizeMatcher' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' itself has many dependencies, this does not indicate that 'CollectionSizeMatcher' is hub-like since it only directly depends on a small number of abstractions and is not depended upon by any other classes."
