    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ClassVisitorFactory' has outgoing dependencies to 34 other classes and 1 incoming dependency from 'ByteBuddyAndroidService'. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
