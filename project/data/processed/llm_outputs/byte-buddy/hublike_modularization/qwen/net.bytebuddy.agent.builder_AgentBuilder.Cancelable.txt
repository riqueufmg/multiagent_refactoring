    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Cancelable' has only one outgoing dependency to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and is listed as a dependency in the incoming dependencies of 'AgentBuilder'. The number of dependencies is not excessively high, and there is no evidence of it being a hub with numerous connections to other abstractions."
