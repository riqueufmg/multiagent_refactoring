    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForCreation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForCreation' has outgoing dependencies to 15 other classes across multiple packages. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, it has no incoming dependencies, meaning it is not depended upon by other classes, further supporting the presence of this smell as it acts as a hub reaching out to many other components without being a central point of dependency itself."
