    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WriterFactory' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes: 'JavaType', 'ParameterDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'AnnotationDescription', and 'TypeDescription'. Each of these classes, in turn, has a large number of their own dependencies, indicating that 'WriterFactory' interacts with a broad and complex network of abstractions. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the 'Advice' class, which itself has a very large number of dependencies (over 150), showing that 'WriterFactory' is also a central point of reliance within its module. This high number of both incoming and outgoing connections confirms the presence of the Hub-like Modularization smell."
