```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.InitializationHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class (TypeWriter). The outgoing dependencies span multiple packages including net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute, net.bytebuddy.description.method, net.bytebuddy.description.type, net.bytebuddy.implementation, and net.bytebuddy.utility. The incoming dependency from TypeWriter shows it depends on this class. This pattern of having both multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies with various abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
