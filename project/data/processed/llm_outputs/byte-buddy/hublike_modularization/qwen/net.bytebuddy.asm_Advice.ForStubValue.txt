    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForStubValue' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'. The dependencies are not extensive enough to qualify as hub-like modularization, which requires a large number of dependencies in both directions."
