{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AnnotationRemoval.AnnotationRemovingFieldVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ElementMatcher and OpenedClassReader) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
