    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithPreservedArguments' has only two outgoing dependencies ('TypeDescription' and 'MethodDescription') and one incoming dependency from 'Advice'. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
