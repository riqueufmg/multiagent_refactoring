    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForHandle",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForHandle' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'). The outgoing dependencies include central utility and description classes such as 'JavaType', 'JavaConstant', 'MethodDescription', 'TypeDescription', and 'AnnotationDescription', which are each connected to numerous other classes in the system. This creates a hub-like structure where 'Advice.ForHandle' acts as a central point connecting to many other abstractions both directly and indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
