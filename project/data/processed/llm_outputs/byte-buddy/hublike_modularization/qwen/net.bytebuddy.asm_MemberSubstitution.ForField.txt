    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForField",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForField' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution'). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
