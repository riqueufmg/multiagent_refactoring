    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.VisibilityBridgeStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'VisibilityBridgeStrategy' has incoming dependencies from 13 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 21 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting many other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
