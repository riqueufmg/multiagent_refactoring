    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.RedefinitionStrategy' has both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It depends on 6 different classes/packages and is depended upon by 1 class ('AgentBuilder') which itself has extensive dependencies. The high number of dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
