    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.CollectionOneToOneMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.CollectionOneToOneMatcher' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' itself has many dependencies, this does not indicate that 'CollectionOneToOneMatcher' has direct dependencies with a large number of abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have numerous direct connections to other classes."
