    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AccessControllerPlugin, and TypeDescription. While these dependency targets themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies nor incoming dependencies."
