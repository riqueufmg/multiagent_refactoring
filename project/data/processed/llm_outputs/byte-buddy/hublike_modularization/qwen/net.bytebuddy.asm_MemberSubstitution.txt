    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (74 unique classes), which indicates it interacts with many other abstractions. Additionally, it defines numerous inner classes (e.g., ForStubValue, NoOp, Replacement, etc.) that also contribute to its extensive dependency network. This pattern of having many outgoing connections suggests hub-like behavior where the class acts as a central point coordinating interactions between multiple components."
