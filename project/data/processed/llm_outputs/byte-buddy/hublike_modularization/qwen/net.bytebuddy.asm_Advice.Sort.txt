    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Sort' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice', which itself has a large number of dependencies. However, 'Advice.Sort' does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have dependencies from a large number of other abstractions. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
