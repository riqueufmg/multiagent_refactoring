{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.FieldPool",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.FieldPool' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class. The outgoing dependencies include 'FieldAttributeAppender', 'AnnotationValueFilter', 'FieldDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. The incoming dependency is from 'TypeWriter', which itself has a large number of dependencies. This pattern of having multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies with various abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
