    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForFieldAccess",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForFieldAccess' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions: ElementMatcher, FieldDescription, JavaConstant, TypeDescription, TypeList, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the class 'MemberSubstitution' which itself has dependencies to a large number of abstractions (as listed in the incoming_dependencies section). This pattern of having both multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies indicates hub-like modularization where the class acts as a central point connecting to many other abstractions."
