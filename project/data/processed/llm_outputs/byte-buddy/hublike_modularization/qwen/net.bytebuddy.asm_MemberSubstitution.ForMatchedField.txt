    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMatchedField' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution'. The dependencies do not indicate a hub-like structure where this class acts as a central point connecting to a large number of other abstractions. The incoming dependencies show a single source, and the outgoing dependencies are minimal, which does not satisfy the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
