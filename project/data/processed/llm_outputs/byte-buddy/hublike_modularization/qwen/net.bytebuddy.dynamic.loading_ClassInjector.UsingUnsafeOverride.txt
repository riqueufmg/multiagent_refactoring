    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingUnsafeOverride",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ClassLoadingStrategy' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and there are no incoming dependencies from other classes. This does not indicate a hub-like modularization smell as it does not have a large number of dependencies in either direction."
