    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RepeatedAnnotationPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'RepeatedAnnotationPlugin' has outgoing dependencies to 7 classes and incoming dependencies from 2 classes. The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as 'Plugin', 'DynamicType', 'MethodDescription', 'ElementMatchers', 'TypeDescription', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'ClassFileLocator', which are central to the ByteBuddy library's functionality. Additionally, incoming dependencies originate from 'Advice' and 'Advice.AssignReturned', both of which are part of the 'net.bytebuddy.asm' package and are known to be complex and widely-used components. This pattern of having numerous and significant incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'RepeatedAnnotationPlugin' acts as a hub connecting various parts of the system, thus exhibiting Hub-like Modularization."
