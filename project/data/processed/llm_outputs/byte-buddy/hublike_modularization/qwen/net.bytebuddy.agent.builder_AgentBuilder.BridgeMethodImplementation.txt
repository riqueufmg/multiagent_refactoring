    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.BridgeMethodImplementation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to JavaConstant, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, StackManipulation, and MethodDescription. While some of these dependencies have extensive dependency lists themselves, the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies, which would be indicative of Hub-like Modularization."
