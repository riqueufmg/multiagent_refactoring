```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ResubmissionStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.ResubmissionStrategy' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'AgentBuilder', 'ClassFileVersion', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. The incoming dependencies come only from 'AgentBuilder'. This is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as the class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies with many other abstractions. Hub-like modularization requires both a high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies with numerous other classes, which is not the case here."
