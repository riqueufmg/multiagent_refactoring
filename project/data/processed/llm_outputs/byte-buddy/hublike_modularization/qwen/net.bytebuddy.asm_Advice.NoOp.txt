{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.NoOp' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice' shows a high number of dependencies (67), but this reflects the complexity of the parent class 'Advice' rather than the 'NoOp' class itself. The 'NoOp' class does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) in isolation, which is the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
