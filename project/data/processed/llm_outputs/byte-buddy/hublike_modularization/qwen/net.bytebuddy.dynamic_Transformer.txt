    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer' has outgoing dependencies to 10 different classes and incoming dependencies from 34 different classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting numerous other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
