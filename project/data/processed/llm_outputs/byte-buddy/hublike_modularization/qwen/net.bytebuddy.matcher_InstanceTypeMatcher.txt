    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.InstanceTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'InstanceTypeMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher', 'TypeDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'TypeDescription' itself has many dependencies (39), and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' also has several (14), the 'InstanceTypeMatcher' class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies, which would be indicative of Hub-like Modularization. The class appears to have a limited and focused set of dependencies."
