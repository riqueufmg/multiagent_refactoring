    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.BooleanMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BooleanMatcher has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ElementMatcher and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and appears in the incoming dependencies of only 1 other class (ElementMatchers). This limited number of connections does not indicate hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
