    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes Implementation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and MethodDescription, which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the analyzed class does not show a pattern of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
