    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 22 other classes in the 'net.bytebuddy.description.method' package and incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph' which itself depends on 26 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
