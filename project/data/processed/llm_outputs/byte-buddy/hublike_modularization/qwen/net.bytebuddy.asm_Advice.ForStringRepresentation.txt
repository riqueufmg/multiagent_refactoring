    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForStringRepresentation' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'. The number of dependencies is not sufficiently large to qualify as Hub-like Modularization, which requires both a high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies to or from many other abstractions."
