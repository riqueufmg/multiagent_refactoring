    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeConstantAdjustment' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes: 'FieldDescription', 'MethodList', 'OpenedClassReader', 'FieldList', 'ClassFileVersion', 'Implementation', 'TypePool', and 'TypeDescription'. Each of these dependent classes also has a large number of their own dependencies, indicating that 'TypeConstantAdjustment' interacts with a wide range of abstractions both directly and indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
