        "The class 'RebaseDynamicTypeBuilder' has outgoing dependencies to 33 other classes, which indicates a high number of outgoing dependencies.",
        "The class interacts with various core abstractions such as 'TypeWriter', 'MethodRegistry', 'InstrumentedType', 'DynamicType', 'AsmVisitorWrapper', and 'TypePool', suggesting it coordinates between multiple subsystems.",
        "There are no incoming dependencies listed, but the high number of outgoing dependencies already suggests hub-like behavior where this class acts as a central coordinator or facade."
