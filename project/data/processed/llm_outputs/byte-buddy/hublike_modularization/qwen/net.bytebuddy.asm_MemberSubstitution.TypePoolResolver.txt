{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.TypePoolResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency is from a single class (MemberSubstitution) which itself has many dependencies, but that does not indicate hub-like modularization for TypePoolResolver. The class does not show a pattern of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing."
