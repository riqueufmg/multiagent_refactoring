    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForDynamicConstant' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct classes, including 'JavaConstant', 'ParameterDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'Assigner', 'TypeDescription', 'AnnotationDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Additionally, it is depended upon by 'MemberSubstitution', which itself has a very large number of dependencies (55), indicating that 'ForDynamicConstant' acts as a central hub in the module interaction. The class interacts with core abstractions across multiple domains such as type descriptions, method descriptions, annotations, and bytecode manipulation, making it a highly connected component."
