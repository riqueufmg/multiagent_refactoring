    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForModuleType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter', which itself has many dependencies. However, the class in question does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
