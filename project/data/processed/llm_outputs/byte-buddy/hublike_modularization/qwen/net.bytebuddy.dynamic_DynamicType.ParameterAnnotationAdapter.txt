    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ParameterAnnotationAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, ParameterDescription, and MethodDescription. While these dependency targets themselves have many dependencies, the ParameterAnnotationAdapter class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
