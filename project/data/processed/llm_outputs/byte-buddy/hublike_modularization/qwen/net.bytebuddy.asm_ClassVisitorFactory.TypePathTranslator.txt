{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.TypePathTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to Implementation, TypeDescription, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, which are core abstractions but do not indicate hub-like behavior given the limited number of connections. The incoming dependency is from ClassVisitorFactory, showing a single point of usage. This does not demonstrate the 'large number of dependencies' characteristic required for Hub-like Modularization."
