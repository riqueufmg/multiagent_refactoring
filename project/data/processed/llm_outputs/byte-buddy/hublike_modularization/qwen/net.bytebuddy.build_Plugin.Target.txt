    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Target' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and 'ClassFileLocator', and it is depended on by 'Plugin'. This is not a large number of dependencies, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
