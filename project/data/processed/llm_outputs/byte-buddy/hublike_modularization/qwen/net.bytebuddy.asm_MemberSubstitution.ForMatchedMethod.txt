{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMatchedMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForMatchedMethod' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 3 other abstractions: 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 1 abstraction ('net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution'), which itself depends on a large number of other abstractions (as listed in the input). The class acts as a central point connecting multiple modules, thus fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
