    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.WithAnnotationDefaultValue' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes, but no incoming dependencies from other classes. Hub-like Modularization requires both significant incoming and outgoing dependencies, indicating that the class is central in both directions. Since there are no incoming dependencies, it does not act as a hub in the modularization structure."
