{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForAllArguments",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForAllArguments' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution'). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, being referenced by another class that itself has a very large number of dependencies suggests that this class acts as a hub in the module interaction graph."
