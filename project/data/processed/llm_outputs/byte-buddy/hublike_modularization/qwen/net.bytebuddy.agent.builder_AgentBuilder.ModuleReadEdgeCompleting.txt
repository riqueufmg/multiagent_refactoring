    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ModuleReadEdgeCompleting",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have multiple dependencies, but the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor is it depended upon by many other abstractions, thus not exhibiting hub-like modularization."
