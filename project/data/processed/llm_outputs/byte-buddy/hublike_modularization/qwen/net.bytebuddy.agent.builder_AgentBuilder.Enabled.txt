    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Enabled' has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is not sufficiently large to qualify as Hub-like Modularization, which requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
