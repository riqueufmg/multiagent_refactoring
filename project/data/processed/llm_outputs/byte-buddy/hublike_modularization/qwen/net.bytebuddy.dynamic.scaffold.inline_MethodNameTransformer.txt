    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodNameTransformer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodNameTransformer' has incoming dependencies from 19 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 2 classes. The incoming dependencies include classes from multiple packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.agent.builder', 'net.bytebuddy', 'net.bytebuddy.build', and 'net.bytebuddy.build.gradle'. The outgoing dependencies are to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and 'MethodDescription'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'MethodNameTransformer' acts as a hub connecting various parts of the system, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
