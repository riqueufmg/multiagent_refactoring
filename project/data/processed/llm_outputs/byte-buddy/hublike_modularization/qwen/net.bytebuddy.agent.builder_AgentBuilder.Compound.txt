    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Compound' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies ('HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and 'ClassFileLocator') do not indicate a large number of interactions, and there are no incoming dependencies suggesting other abstractions depend on this class. Therefore, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
