    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.NoOp' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription'. While these dependency targets themselves have many dependencies, the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies, which is required for Hub-like Modularization."
