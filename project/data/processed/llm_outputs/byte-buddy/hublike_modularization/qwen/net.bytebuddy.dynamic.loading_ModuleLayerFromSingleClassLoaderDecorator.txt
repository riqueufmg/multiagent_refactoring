    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator' has outgoing dependencies to 23 other classes, including multiple inner classes and external abstractions. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, both within its own package and externally."
