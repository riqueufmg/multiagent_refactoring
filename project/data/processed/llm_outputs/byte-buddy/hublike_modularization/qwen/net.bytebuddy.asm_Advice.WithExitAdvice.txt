    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithExitAdvice",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithExitAdvice' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes, which in turn have a large number of their own dependencies. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the 'Advice' class, which itself depends on a very large number of abstractions (60+). This pattern of both high incoming and outgoing dependency connections indicates hub-like behavior where the class acts as a central point connecting numerous other abstractions."
