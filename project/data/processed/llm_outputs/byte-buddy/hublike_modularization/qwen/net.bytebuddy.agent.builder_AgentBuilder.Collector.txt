    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Collector",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Collector' has incoming dependencies from 'AgentBuilder' and outgoing dependencies to 'AgentBuilder' and 'TypeDescription'. While it interacts with these two classes, it does not exhibit a large number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with many other abstractions. The dependency count is relatively low and focused, not indicating hub-like modularization."
