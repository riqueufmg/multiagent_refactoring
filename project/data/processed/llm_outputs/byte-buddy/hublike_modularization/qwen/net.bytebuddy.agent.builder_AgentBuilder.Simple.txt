    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Simple",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Simple' has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes: 'AccessControllerPlugin', 'ClassLoadingStrategy', 'TypePool', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'ClassFileLocator'. Each of these classes in turn has a substantial number of their own dependencies, indicating that 'AgentBuilder.Simple' interacts with a wide range of abstractions both directly and indirectly. This creates a hub-like structure where 'AgentBuilder.Simple' acts as a central point connecting to many other components, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
