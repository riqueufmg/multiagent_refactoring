    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForAdvice",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.ForAdvice' has outgoing dependencies to 9 different classes across multiple packages. Additionally, the detailed outgoing dependencies show that it connects to numerous sub-components within the 'Advice' class (e.g., ForPostProcessor, ForThisReference, RelocationHandler, etc.), indicating a high number of fine-grained dependencies. This pattern of extensive outgoing links to various abstractions suggests hub-like modularization where this class acts as a central coordinator interacting with many other parts of the system."
