    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Unresolved",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Unresolved' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution'), which itself depends on a large number of abstractions. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with many other abstractions, contributing to hub-like modularization. Additionally, its role within the 'MemberSubstitution' hierarchy suggests it is a central component with significant coupling to various parts of the system."
