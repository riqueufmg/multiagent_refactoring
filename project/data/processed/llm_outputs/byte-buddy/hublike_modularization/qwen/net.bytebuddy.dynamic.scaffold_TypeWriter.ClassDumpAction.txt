    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.ClassDumpAction' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'TypeDescription', and 'ClassFileLocator'. The only incoming dependency is from 'TypeWriter'. The dependencies themselves do not indicate that 'TypeWriter.ClassDumpAction' is central or acts as a hub within the module, as it does not show a high number of interactions or coordination with a large number of other abstractions."
