{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.PatchingModuleVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to OpenedClassReader and ModuleDescription, which themselves have further dependencies, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The total number of direct dependencies (2 outgoing, 0 incoming) is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
