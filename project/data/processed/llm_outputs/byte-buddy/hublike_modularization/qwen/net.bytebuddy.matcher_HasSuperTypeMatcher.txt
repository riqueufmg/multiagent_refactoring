    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.HasSuperTypeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'HasSuperTypeMatcher' has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher', 'TypeDefinition', 'TypeDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While some of these dependencies like 'TypeDescription' have many dependencies themselves, the 'HasSuperTypeMatcher' class itself does not show hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies or dependents."
