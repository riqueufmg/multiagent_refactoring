    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy.Suffixing' has only two outgoing dependencies ('HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and 'TypeDescription') and one incoming dependency from 'NamingStrategy'. While the dependencies themselves have numerous further dependencies, the class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies in either direction, which is required to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
