    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Resolved' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 4 classes, including 'MethodGraph' which itself has 22 dependencies, and 'MethodDescription' with 24 dependencies. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'MethodGraph', which also has 22 dependencies. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
