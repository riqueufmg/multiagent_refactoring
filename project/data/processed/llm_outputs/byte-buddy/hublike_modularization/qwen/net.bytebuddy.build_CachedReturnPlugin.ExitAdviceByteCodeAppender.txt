{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin.ExitAdviceByteCodeAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'Implementation' has many dependencies, the ExitAdviceByteCodeAppender itself does not directly depend on those, thus it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
