    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (MethodDescription) and one incoming dependency (MethodGraph). The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
