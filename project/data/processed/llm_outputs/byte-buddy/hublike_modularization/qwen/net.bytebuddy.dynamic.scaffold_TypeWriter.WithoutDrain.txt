    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.WithoutDrain' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'Implementation', 'AnnotationValueFilter', and 'ByteCodeAppender'. The only incoming dependency is from 'TypeWriter'. The number of dependencies is not excessively high, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous connections to other abstractions in the provided data."
