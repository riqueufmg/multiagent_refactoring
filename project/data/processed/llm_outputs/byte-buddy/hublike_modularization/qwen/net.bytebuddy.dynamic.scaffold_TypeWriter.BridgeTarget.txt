    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.BridgeTarget",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.BridgeTarget' has only outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization. Hub-like modularization requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not observed here."
