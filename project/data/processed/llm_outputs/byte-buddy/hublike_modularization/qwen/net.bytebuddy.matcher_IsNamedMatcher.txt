    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.IsNamedMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'IsNamedMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher', 'NamedElement', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' itself has many dependencies, this does not indicate that 'IsNamedMatcher' is hub-like since it directly depends on only a few abstractions. There is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies from 'IsNamedMatcher' in isolation."
