    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassInjector.UsingUnsafe",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ClassInjector.UsingUnsafe' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes, including 'JavaDispatcher', 'AccessControllerPlugin', 'ClassLoadingStrategy', 'PackageDescription', 'ClassInjector', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Additionally, it is included in the dependencies of the 'ClassInjector' class, indicating incoming dependency. This pattern of having both numerous outgoing and incoming dependencies with multiple abstractions confirms the presence of hub-like modularization."
