{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.DispatchingVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes: FieldDescription, TypeDescription, Implementation, TypePool, and OpenedClassReader. Each of these dependency classes themselves have extensive dependency lists, indicating that DispatchingVisitor interacts with a wide range of abstractions both directly and indirectly through these dependencies. Although there are no incoming dependencies listed, the outgoing dependency footprint is large and spans multiple core abstractions within the system, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
