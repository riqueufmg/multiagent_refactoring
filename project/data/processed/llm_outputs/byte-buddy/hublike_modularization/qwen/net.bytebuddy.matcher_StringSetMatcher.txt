    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.StringSetMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class StringSetMatcher has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ElementMatcher and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and no incoming dependencies. The dependency HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself has many outgoing dependencies, but this does not indicate that StringSetMatcher is hub-like since we must analyze the class in isolation. There is no evidence that StringSetMatcher has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
