    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.ForClassLoader' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (18) and incoming dependencies (115), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it. This pattern of extensive bidirectional dependencies characterizes Hub-like Modularization."
