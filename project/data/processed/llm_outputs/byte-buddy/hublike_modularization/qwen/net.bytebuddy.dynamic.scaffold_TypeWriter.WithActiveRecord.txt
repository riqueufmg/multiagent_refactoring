{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithActiveRecord",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes Implementation, AnnotationValueFilter, and ByteCodeAppender. While the Implementation class itself has many dependencies, the TypeWriter.WithActiveRecord class does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
