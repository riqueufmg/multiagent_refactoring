    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForElementMatchers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ElementMatcher and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself has many dependencies, the AgentBuilder.ForElementMatchers class only directly depends on these two abstractions, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
