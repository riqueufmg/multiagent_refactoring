    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher.ForFieldToken' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher', 'net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription', and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' itself has many dependencies, the class in question does not directly depend on those, and it does not have a large number of dependencies itself. Therefore, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
