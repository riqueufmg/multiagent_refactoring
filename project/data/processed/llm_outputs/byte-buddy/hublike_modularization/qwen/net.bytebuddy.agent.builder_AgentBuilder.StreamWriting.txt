    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.StreamWriting' has only two outgoing dependencies ('AgentBuilder' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin') and appears in the incoming dependencies of only one class ('AgentBuilder'). This limited number of connections does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
