    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ElementMatcher, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and MethodGraph, which are not numerous enough to indicate hub-like modularization. None of these dependencies show a pattern of excessive coupling that would suggest the class is acting as a hub."
