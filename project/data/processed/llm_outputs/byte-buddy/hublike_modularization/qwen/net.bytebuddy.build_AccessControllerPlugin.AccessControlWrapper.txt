    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (7) and no incoming dependencies. The dependencies are focused on specific functional areas (ASM, type descriptions, method descriptions, implementation details) rather than spanning a large number of unrelated abstractions. There is no evidence of hub-like behavior where the class acts as a central point connecting many unrelated parts of the system."
