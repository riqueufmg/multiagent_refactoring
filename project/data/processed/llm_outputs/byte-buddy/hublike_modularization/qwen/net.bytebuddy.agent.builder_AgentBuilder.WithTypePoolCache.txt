{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.WithTypePoolCache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes TypePool, AccessControllerPlugin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and ClassLoadingStrategy. While some of these dependencies have extensive internal dependencies themselves, the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies, which would be indicative of hub-like modularization."
