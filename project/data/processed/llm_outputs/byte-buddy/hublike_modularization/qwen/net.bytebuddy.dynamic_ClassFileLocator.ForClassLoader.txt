    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForClassLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator.ForClassLoader' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class. The outgoing dependencies include 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'AccessControllerPlugin', 'ClassLoadingStrategy', 'StreamDrainer', and 'TypeDescription', which are diverse and numerous. Additionally, it is depended upon by 'ClassFileLocator', indicating bidirectional dependency involvement. This pattern of having multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies with various abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
