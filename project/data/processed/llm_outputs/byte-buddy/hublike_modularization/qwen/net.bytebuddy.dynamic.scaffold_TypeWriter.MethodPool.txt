{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.MethodPool",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.MethodPool' has outgoing dependencies to 15 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter'). This results in a total of 16 dependencies (incoming + outgoing), which is significantly high and indicates hub-like modularization. The class interacts with a wide range of abstractions across different packages, making it a central point of communication in the system."
