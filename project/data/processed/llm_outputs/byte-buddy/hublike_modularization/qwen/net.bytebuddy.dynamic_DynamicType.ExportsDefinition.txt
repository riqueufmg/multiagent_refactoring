    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.ExportsDefinition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType, which itself has numerous dependencies. However, the class in question does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions directly."
