    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForInlining",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.ForInlining' has outgoing dependencies to 21 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('TypeWriter'). The class interacts with a large number of abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependencies, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization. The high number of dependencies indicates it serves as a central hub connecting various parts of the system."
