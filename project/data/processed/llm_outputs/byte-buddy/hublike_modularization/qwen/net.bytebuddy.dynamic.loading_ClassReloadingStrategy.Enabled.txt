{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassReloadingStrategy.Enabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have many dependencies, but that does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class. Hub-like modularization requires the class in question to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
