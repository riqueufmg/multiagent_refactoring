    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Source",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Source' has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes: 'JavaConstant', 'TypeDescription', 'ByteCodeElement', 'TypeList', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the class 'MemberSubstitution', which itself has a large number of dependencies (65). This bidirectional coupling with multiple abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
