    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.PoolStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.PoolStrategy' has outgoing dependencies to 4 classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('AgentBuilder'). The outgoing dependencies include 'TypePool' which itself has a large number of dependencies (60+), indicating it is a hub. Additionally, 'AgentBuilder.PoolStrategy' depends on other potentially central classes like 'ClassLoadingStrategy', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'AccessControllerPlugin'. On the incoming side, 'AgentBuilder' has a very large number of dependencies (100+), suggesting it is also a hub that interacts with many abstractions. This pattern of having dependencies with large numbers of other abstractions, both incoming and outgoing, indicates Hub-like Modularization."
