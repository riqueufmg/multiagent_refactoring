    "justification": "The class 'PrimitiveTypeMatcher' has only 2 outgoing dependencies ('ElementMatcher' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous connections to other abstractions."
