{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.PersistenceHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to AccessControllerPlugin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and JavaDispatcher. The incoming dependencies are from ByteArrayClassLoader. The dependencies themselves have numerous connections, but the PersistenceHandler class in isolation does not exhibit a high number of direct dependencies in both directions, which is required for Hub-like Modularization."
