    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForRecord",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter', which itself has numerous dependencies. However, 'TypeWriter.ForRecord' does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies from different sources. The single incoming dependency is from a hub-like class ('TypeWriter'), but this does not make 'TypeWriter.ForRecord' itself hub-like."
