    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Listener' has incoming dependencies only from 'AgentBuilder' and outgoing dependencies to 5 classes. The number of dependencies is not significantly high to qualify as Hub-like Modularization, especially considering the scope of the class and typical interaction patterns in such frameworks. The class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate it acts as a hub."
