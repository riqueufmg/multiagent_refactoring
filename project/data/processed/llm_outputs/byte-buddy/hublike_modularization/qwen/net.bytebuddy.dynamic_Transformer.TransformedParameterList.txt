    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.TransformedParameterList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (ParameterList) and 0 incoming dependencies. While the outgoing dependency ParameterList itself has many dependencies (10), the TransformedParameterList class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
