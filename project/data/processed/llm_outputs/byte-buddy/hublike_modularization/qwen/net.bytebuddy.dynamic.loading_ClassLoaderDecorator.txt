    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ClassLoaderDecorator' has both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It has 11 incoming dependencies from various classes within the same package and 2 outgoing dependencies, one of which ('HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin') has 16 dependencies and another ('TypeDescription') has 65 dependencies. This extensive web of dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
