    "justification": "The class 'Plugin.Engine' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes, but there are no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires both significant incoming and outgoing dependencies, indicating the class is central in both directions. Since there are no incoming dependencies, it does not act as a hub in the modularization structure."
