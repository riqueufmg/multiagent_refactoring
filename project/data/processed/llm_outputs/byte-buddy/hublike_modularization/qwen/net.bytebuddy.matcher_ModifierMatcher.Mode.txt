{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ModifierMatcher.Mode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to ModifierMatcher and one incoming dependency from ModifierMatcher. The dependency pattern shows a simple bidirectional relationship between the inner class Mode and its outer class ModifierMatcher, which is typical for inner class usage and does not indicate hub-like modularization with multiple abstractions."
