    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass.SubclassImplementationTarget",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'SubclassImplementationTarget' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include complex and central classes like 'Implementation', 'MethodGraph', 'TypeDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', which are likely to be widely used across the system. The incoming dependencies come from key classes such as 'TypeWriter' and 'SubclassDynamicTypeBuilder', indicating that this class is relied upon by important parts of the system. This pattern of having multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies with central and complex classes indicates that 'SubclassImplementationTarget' acts as a hub, connecting various parts of the system, thus exhibiting the Hub-like Modularization smell."
