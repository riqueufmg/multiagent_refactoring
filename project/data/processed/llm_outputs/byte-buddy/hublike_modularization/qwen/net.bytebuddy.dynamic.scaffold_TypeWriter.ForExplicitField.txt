```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForExplicitField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.ForExplicitField' has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'FieldAttributeAppender', 'AnnotationValueFilter', 'FieldDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While some of these dependencies like 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' have numerous dependencies themselves, the class in question does not exhibit a high number of direct dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization. Hub-like modularization requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not present in this case."
