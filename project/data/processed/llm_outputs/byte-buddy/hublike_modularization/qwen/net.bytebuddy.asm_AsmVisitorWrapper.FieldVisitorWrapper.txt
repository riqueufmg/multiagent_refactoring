    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AsmVisitorWrapper.FieldVisitorWrapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to FieldDescription and no incoming dependencies. While FieldDescription itself has multiple dependencies (9), the FieldVisitorWrapper class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
