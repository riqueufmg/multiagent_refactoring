    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Plugin.ArgumentResolver' has only one outgoing dependency ('HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin') and one incoming dependency ('Plugin'). The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing."
