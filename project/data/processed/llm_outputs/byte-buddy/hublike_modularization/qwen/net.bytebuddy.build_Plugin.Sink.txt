    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Sink' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its high number of dependencies. It has 1 outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator', which itself has 16 outgoing dependencies to various classes. Additionally, it has 1 incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin', which depends on 30 different classes, including 'Plugin.Sink'. This creates a hub-like structure where 'Plugin.Sink' is central to a large number of dependencies, both directly and indirectly."
