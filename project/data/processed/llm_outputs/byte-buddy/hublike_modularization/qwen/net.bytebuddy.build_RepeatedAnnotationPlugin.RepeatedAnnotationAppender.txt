    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RepeatedAnnotationPlugin.RepeatedAnnotationAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and TypeDescription, which themselves have many dependencies, but the RepeatedAnnotationAppender class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies or dependents."
