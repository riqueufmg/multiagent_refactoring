    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForDynamicConstant' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'). The outgoing dependencies include core framework classes such as 'JavaConstant', 'ParameterDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'TypeDescription', 'AnnotationDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', indicating it interacts with multiple foundational abstractions. Additionally, being referenced by the 'Advice' class, which itself has a large number of dependencies, suggests this class acts as a hub connecting various parts of the system. This pattern of having numerous incoming and outgoing connections qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
