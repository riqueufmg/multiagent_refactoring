    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldRegistry.Entry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 5 other abstractions, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization. There are no incoming dependencies, further reducing its connectivity. Hub-like modularization typically involves both high incoming and outgoing dependencies, creating a central hub in the system architecture."
