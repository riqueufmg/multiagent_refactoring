    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForClass' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter', which itself has a large number of dependencies. However, 'TypeWriter.ForClass' does not directly depend on or interact with a large number of other abstractions. The incoming dependencies are indirect through the parent 'TypeWriter' class. Therefore, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
