    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.CreationClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Implementation, OpenedClassReader, TypeInitializer, and ModuleDescription. While some of these dependencies have further outgoing dependencies, the class itself does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies in either direction, which is the key indicator of Hub-like Modularization."
