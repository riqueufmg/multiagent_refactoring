    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Implementation and AnnotationValueFilter classes, which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the WithoutActiveRecord class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor is it depended upon by many other abstractions."
