    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Key' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'MethodGraph', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'Visibility', and 'MethodDescription'. The incoming dependencies come only from 'MethodGraph'. This level of dependency does not indicate a hub-like structure, as it does not show excessive or centralizing dependencies with a large number of abstractions."
