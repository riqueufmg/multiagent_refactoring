    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.AnnotationRemoval",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AnnotationRemoval' has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes, but no incoming dependencies. While it depends on multiple abstractions, the lack of incoming dependencies means it does not act as a hub that other classes depend on. Hub-like Modularization requires both significant incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not present here."
