    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType.Default' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 18 different classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 class ('InstrumentedType'), which itself has a large number of dependencies. The class interacts with numerous abstractions across various packages including 'net.bytebuddy.description.*', 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.*', 'net.bytebuddy.utility.*', and 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.*'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing connections indicates it acts as a central hub in the modular structure."
