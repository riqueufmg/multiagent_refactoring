{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ReadOnly",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ReadOnly' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription', which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies. Therefore, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
