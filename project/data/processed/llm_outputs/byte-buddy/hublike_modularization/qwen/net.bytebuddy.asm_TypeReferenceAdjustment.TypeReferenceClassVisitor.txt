    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.TypeReferenceAdjustment.TypeReferenceClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ElementMatcher, TypePool, and OpenedClassReader. While TypePool itself has many dependencies, the TypeReferenceClassVisitor only directly depends on these three classes, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization. There are no incoming dependencies, meaning no other classes depend on this class. The number of dependencies is not excessive for this class in isolation."
