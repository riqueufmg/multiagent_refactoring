    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Minimal' has only two outgoing dependencies ('AuxiliaryType' and 'DynamicType') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it being a central hub with numerous connections to other abstractions in the provided data."
