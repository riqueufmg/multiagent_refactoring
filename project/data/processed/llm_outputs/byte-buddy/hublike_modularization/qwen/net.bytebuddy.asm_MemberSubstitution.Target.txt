    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Target",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Target' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include 'net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant' which itself has 26 dependencies, 'net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement' with 5 dependencies, and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription' with 49 dependencies. The incoming dependencies come from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution', which has 84 dependencies. This pattern of having a class with multiple dependencies that also have numerous dependencies themselves indicates hub-like modularization, where the class acts as a central point connecting to many other abstractions directly or indirectly."
