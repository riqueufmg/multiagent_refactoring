    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.DeduplicatingClassVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader and 0 incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
