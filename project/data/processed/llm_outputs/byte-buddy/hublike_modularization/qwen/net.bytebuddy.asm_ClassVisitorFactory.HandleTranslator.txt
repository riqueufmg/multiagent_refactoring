    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory.HandleTranslator' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'Implementation', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'MethodDescription', and it is only depended on by 'ClassVisitorFactory'. This level of dependency does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not exhibit a high number of interactions with other abstractions in the system."
