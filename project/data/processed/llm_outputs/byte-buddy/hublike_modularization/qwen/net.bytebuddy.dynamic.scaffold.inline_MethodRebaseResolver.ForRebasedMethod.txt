    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline.MethodRebaseResolver.ForRebasedMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies include complex types such as MethodDescription, TypeDescription, AnnotationList, ParameterList, and others, indicating a high level of interaction with various abstractions. This pattern of having numerous outgoing dependencies without incoming ones suggests hub-like behavior where the class acts as a central point interacting with many other components."
