    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to AuxiliaryType and 0 incoming dependencies. The total number of dependencies (1 outgoing) is below the threshold that would indicate hub-like modularization. There is no evidence of excessive dependencies that would characterize this as a hub-like abstraction."
