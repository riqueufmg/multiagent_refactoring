    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.Enforcing' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin', which itself has many dependencies. However, 'Plugin.Enforcing' does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies from different sources. The hub-like characteristic is not present in this class in isolation."
