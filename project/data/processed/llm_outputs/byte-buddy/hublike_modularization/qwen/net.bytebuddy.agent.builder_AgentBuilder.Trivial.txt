    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Trivial' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder', which itself has a large number of dependencies. However, the class in question does not exhibit hub-like modularization since it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
