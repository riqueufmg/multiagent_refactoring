    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading.ByteArrayClassLoader.ClassDefinitionAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'PackageDefinitionStrategy' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The number of direct dependencies is low, not indicating hub-like modularization."
