{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Delegation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, MethodGraph, and MethodDescription. While these dependencies themselves have many dependencies, the MethodGraph.Delegation class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) which would indicate hub-like modularization."
