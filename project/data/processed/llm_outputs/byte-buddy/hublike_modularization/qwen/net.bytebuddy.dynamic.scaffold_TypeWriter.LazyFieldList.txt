{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.LazyFieldList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FieldList, FieldDescription, and TypeDescription. While TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, the LazyFieldList class does not directly depend on those downstream classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has a limited number of direct dependencies and no incoming dependencies indicating it is not a central hub."
