    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Access' has only 2 outgoing dependencies (FieldDescription and JavaConstant) and 1 incoming dependency (MemberSubstitution). The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it being a central hub with numerous incoming and outgoing connections to a large number of other abstractions."
