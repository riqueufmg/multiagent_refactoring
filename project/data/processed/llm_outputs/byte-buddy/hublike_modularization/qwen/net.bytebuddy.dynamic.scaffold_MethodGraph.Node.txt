    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Node' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 4 classes, including 'MethodGraph' which itself has 23 dependencies, indicating a central role in the module. Additionally, it receives incoming dependencies from 'MethodGraph', which also lists 23 dependencies, showing that 'MethodGraph.Node' is involved in a highly interconnected set of relationships both in terms of outgoing and incoming connections, making it a hub within the modular structure."
