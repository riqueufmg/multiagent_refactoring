The outgoing dependencies include classes from different packages such as net.bytebuddy.build, net.bytebuddy.utility, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign, and net.bytebuddy.description.type. This wide range of dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
