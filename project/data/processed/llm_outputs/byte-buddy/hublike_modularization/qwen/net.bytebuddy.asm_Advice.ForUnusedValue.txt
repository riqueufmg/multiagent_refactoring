    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForUnusedValue' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 4 classes, which in turn have numerous further dependencies. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice', which itself depends on a very large number of other classes (50+). This creates a hub-like structure where 'Advice.ForUnusedValue' is centrally connected to many other abstractions both directly and indirectly through 'Advice'."
