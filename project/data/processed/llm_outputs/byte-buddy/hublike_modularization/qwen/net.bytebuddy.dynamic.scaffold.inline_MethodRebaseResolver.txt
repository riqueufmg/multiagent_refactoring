    "justification": "The class 'MethodRebaseResolver' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (12) and incoming dependencies (9), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions. This extensive dependency network, both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it, characterizes the Hub-like Modularization smell."
