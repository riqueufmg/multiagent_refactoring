    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForDefaultValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForDefaultValue' has incoming dependencies from a large number of abstractions (39 dependencies listed under incoming_dependencies) and also has outgoing dependencies to multiple abstractions (3 dependencies listed under outgoing_dependencies). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, where the class acts as a central point connecting many other abstractions."
