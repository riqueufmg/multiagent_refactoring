{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin.Initializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Implementation, and TypeDescription, which are all directly related to its functionality as an initializer. The incoming dependency is from AccessControllerPlugin, which is expected as it's an inner class. The number of dependencies is not excessive and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
