    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.BootstrapArgumentResolver' has incoming dependencies from a large number of abstractions (as seen in the extensive list under 'incoming_dependencies' from 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice'), and it also has outgoing dependencies to multiple abstractions including 'net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription'. This pattern of having both numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
