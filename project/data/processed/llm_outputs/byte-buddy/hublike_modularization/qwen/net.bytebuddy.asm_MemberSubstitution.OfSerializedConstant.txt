    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfSerializedConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, StackManipulation, and AnnotationDescription. While some of these dependencies have extensive dependency lists themselves, the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies. Therefore, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
