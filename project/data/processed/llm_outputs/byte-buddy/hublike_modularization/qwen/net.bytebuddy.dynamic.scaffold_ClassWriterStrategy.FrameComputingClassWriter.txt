    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency itself has multiple dependencies, but the FrameComputingClassWriter does not directly depend on those. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
