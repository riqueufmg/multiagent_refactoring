    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.Transformer.MethodModifierTransformer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ModifierContributor, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and MethodDescription. While some of these dependencies have further dependencies themselves, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions."
