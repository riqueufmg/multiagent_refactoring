    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.UnresolvedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypeResolutionStrategy, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and DynamicType. While DynamicType has many dependencies itself, the UnresolvedType class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies nor incoming dependencies from other classes."
