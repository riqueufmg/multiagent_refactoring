    "justification": "The class TypeValidation has no outgoing dependencies and is only depended upon by other classes. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies from diverse parts of the system. The incoming dependencies are limited to a few specific packages and classes within the same library."
