    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph.Detached' has outgoing dependencies to 22 different abstractions within the 'net.bytebuddy.description.method' package and incoming dependencies from 22 different abstractions within the 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph' class. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class acts as a central point connecting numerous other abstractions."
