    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.LatentMatcher.ForMethodToken' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription'. While these dependencies themselves have multiple dependencies, the class in question does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies in either direction, thus not qualifying as Hub-like Modularization."
