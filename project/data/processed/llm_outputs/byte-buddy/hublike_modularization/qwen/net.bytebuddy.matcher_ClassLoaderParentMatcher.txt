    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ClassLoaderParentMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ElementMatcher and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself has many dependencies, this does not make ClassLoaderParentMatcher a hub as it only directly depends on two abstractions."
