    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.WithoutExitAdvice",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation' and no incoming dependencies. The number of outgoing dependencies (1) is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as the class does not interact with a large number of other abstractions directly."
