{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.PatchMode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency shows that AgentBuilder has many dependencies, but that does not indicate that PatchMode itself has dependencies with a large number of abstractions. The outgoing dependencies are limited to two classes, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
