    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Narrowable' has no outgoing dependencies and only appears as a dependency in the incoming dependencies of 'AgentBuilder'. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies (neither incoming nor outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions."
