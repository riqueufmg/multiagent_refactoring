    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.DefinedShapeMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'DefinedShapeMatcher' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ElementMatcher', 'ByteCodeElement', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' itself has many dependencies (14), this does not indicate hub-like modularization for 'DefinedShapeMatcher' because the metric focuses on the number of direct dependencies of the class in question. The class does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies, either incoming or outgoing."
