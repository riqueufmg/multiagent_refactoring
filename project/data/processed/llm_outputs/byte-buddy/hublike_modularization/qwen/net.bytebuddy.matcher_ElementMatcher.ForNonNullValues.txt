    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency has multiple dependencies but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class itself, as it only directly depends on one external class."
