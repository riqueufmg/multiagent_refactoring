    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.Resolved' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution'). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it interacts with a large number of abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
