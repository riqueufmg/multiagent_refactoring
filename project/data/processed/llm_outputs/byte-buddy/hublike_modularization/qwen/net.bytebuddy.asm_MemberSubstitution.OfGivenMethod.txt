    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.OfGivenMethod' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription'. While these dependency targets themselves have many dependencies, the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies. Therefore, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
