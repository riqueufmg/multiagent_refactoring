    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.ForUnifiedAdvice",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.ForUnifiedAdvice' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('Advice' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'), and the 'Advice' class in turn has dependencies to 134 other classes. This indicates that 'AgentBuilder.ForUnifiedAdvice' is connected to a large number of abstractions through its dependencies, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
