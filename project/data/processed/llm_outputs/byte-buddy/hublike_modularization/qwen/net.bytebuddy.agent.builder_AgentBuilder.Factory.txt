    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Factory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.Factory' has incoming dependencies from a large number of classes within the same package 'net.bytebuddy.agent.builder', specifically from 'AgentBuilder' which depends on 100+ other classes including itself. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to multiple external classes such as 'JavaType', 'TypeValidation', 'ClassLoadingStrategy', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', each of which also has further dependencies. This pattern of both high incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
