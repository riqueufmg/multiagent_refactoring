    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.ForAnnotation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeWriter.ForAnnotation' has outgoing dependencies to 23 other classes/interfaces within the 'MethodDescription' abstraction and incoming dependencies from 'TypeWriter' which itself has dependencies to 64 other abstractions. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization where this class acts as a central point connecting to many other parts of the system."
