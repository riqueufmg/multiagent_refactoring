{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin.MultiReleaseVersionMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.ClassFileLocator'. While these dependencies themselves have multiple further dependencies, the direct dependency count for the analyzed class is low, which does not indicate hub-like modularization."
