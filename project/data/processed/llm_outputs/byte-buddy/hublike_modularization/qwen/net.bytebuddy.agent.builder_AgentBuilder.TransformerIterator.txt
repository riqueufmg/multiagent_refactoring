{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.TransformerIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to JavaModule and TypeDescription, each of which have their own extensive dependencies, but the TransformerIterator class itself does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions. The hub-like modularization smell requires the class in question to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
