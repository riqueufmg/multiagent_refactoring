    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (1). The dependencies are focused on related abstractions within the same package and closely related packages, which does not indicate hub-like modularization. There is no evidence of excessive or broad dependency relationships that would characterize this class as a hub."
