    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ReadWrite",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ReadWrite' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes, and one of its dependencies, 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription', itself has a large number of dependencies (39). This indicates hub-like modularization where the abstraction is connected to many other abstractions, both directly and indirectly."
