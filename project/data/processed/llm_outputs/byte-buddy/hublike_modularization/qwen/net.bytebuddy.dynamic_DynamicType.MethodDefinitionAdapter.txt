{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.DynamicType.MethodDefinitionAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'DynamicType.MethodDefinitionAdapter' has outgoing dependencies to 12 different classes across multiple packages. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization where an abstraction has dependencies with many other abstractions."
