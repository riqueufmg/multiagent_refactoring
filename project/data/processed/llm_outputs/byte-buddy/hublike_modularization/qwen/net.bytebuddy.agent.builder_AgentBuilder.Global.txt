    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.Global",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and 0 incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency itself has multiple dependencies (15), but the AgentBuilder.Global class in isolation only connects to 1 other abstraction, which does not indicate hub-like modularization."
