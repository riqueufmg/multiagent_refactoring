    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and TypeDescription, which themselves have many dependencies, but the InnerTypeDefinitionForTypeAdapter class does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have numerous dependencies either incoming or outgoing."
