    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Bound",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Bound' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes: 'StackManipulation', 'MethodDescription', 'TypeDescription', 'Implementation', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the 'Advice' class, which itself depends on a very large number of abstractions (as evidenced by the long list of dependencies), indicating that 'Advice.Bound' is centrally involved in interactions with many other abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming relationships."
