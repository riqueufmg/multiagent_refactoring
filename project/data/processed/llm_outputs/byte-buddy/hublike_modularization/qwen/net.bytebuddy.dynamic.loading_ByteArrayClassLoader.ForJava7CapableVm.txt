    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and no incoming dependencies. While the dependent class itself has many outgoing dependencies, the analyzed class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
