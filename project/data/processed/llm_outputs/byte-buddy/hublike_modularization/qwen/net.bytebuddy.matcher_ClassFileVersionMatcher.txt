    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ClassFileVersionMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ElementMatcher, ClassFileVersion, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself has many dependencies, the ClassFileVersionMatcher does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies, which are key indicators of Hub-like Modularization."
