    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaInstrumentationStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AgentBuilder.LambdaInstrumentationStrategy' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (19) and incoming dependencies (1), indicating hub-like modularization. The large number of outgoing dependencies suggests that this class interacts with many other abstractions, while the incoming dependency shows it is also used by another class, contributing to its central role in the module structure."
