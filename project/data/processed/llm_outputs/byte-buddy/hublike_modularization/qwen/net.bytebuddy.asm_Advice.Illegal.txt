{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Illegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Illegal' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'AnnotationDescription', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'ParameterDescription'. While these dependencies themselves have multiple outgoing dependencies, the class in question does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing), which is the key indicator for Hub-like Modularization. Therefore, it does not qualify as a hub-like module based on the provided data."
