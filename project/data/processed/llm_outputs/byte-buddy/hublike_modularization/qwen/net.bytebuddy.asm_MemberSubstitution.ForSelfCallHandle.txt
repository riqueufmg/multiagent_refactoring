    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForSelfCallHandle",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForSelfCallHandle' has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution'). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it interacts with a large number of abstractions, contributing to hub-like modularization. Additionally, being referenced by another class that itself has a very large number of dependencies suggests this class acts as a hub in the modular structure."
