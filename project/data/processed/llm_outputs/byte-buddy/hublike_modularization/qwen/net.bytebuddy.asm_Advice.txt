    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (84) and incoming dependencies (10), which indicates it acts as a hub connecting numerous other abstractions. This extensive connectivity pattern, both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it, is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
