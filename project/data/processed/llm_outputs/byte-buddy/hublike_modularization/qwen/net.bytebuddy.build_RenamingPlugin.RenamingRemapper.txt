    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to OpenedClassReader and no incoming dependencies. The dependency chain shows OpenedClassReader depends on 3 other classes, but these are not direct dependencies of RenamingRemapper. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal dependencies in both directions."
