    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Enabled",

    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Enabled' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription'. While these dependency classes themselves have many dependencies, the 'Advice.Enabled' class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
