    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.ForValue' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes ('Implementation', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'MethodDescription'), each of which has a large number of further dependencies (28, 16, and 21 respectively). Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the 'Advice' class, which itself depends on 93 other elements. This pattern of high fan-in and fan-out with multiple transitive dependencies indicates hub-like behavior where the class acts as a central point connecting numerous other abstractions."
