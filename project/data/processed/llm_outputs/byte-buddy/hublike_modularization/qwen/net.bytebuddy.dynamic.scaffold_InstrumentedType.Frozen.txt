{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType.Frozen",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes, but no incoming dependencies. While it depends on multiple abstractions, the lack of incoming dependencies means it does not act as a hub that other classes depend on. Hub-like Modularization requires both high outgoing and incoming dependencies to qualify as a hub."
