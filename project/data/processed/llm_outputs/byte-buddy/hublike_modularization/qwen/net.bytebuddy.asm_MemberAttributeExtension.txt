    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MemberAttributeExtension' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by a large number of other abstractions."
