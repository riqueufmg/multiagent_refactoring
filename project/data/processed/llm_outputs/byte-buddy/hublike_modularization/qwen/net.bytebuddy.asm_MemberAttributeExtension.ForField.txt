    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberAttributeExtension.ForField' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes: 'AnnotationList', 'FieldDescription', 'AsmVisitorWrapper', 'AnnotationValueFilter', 'FieldAttributeAppender', and 'OpenedClassReader'. Additionally, these dependent classes themselves have multiple outgoing dependencies, indicating that this class interacts with a wide range of abstractions both directly and indirectly. This high number of dependencies, both incoming and outgoing, qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
