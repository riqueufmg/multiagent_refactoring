{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator.Factory' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription', and 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator'. While some of these dependencies themselves have many dependencies, the Factory class in question does not directly interact with a large number of abstractions. Hub-like Modularization requires the class in question to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
