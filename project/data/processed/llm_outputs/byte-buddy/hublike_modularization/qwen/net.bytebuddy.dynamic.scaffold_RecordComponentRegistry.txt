    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.RecordComponentRegistry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'RecordComponentRegistry' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 10 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting multiple parts of the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
