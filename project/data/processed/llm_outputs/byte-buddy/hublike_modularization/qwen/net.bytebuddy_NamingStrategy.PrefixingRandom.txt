{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.NamingStrategy.PrefixingRandom",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.utility.RandomString' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin itself has many dependencies, the PrefixingRandom class only directly depends on these two classes, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
