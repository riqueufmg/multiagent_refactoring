    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.CachingMatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'CachingMatcher' has outgoing dependencies to 'ElementMatcher' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'ElementMatchers', which itself has dependencies to numerous other classes including 'CachingMatcher'. This bidirectional dependency pattern with multiple abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
