{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.FieldResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.FieldResolver' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and is also depended upon by 'net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution', which itself has a large number of dependencies (45). This indicates that 'FieldResolver' acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
