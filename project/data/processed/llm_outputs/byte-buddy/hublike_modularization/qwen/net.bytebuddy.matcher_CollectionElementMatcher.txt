    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.CollectionElementMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.CollectionElementMatcher' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' has many dependencies, this does not make 'CollectionElementMatcher' a hub since it only directly depends on two abstractions. There are no incoming dependencies indicating other classes depend on it. Therefore, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
