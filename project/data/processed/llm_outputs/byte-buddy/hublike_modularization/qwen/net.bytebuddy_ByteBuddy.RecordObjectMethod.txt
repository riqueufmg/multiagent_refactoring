    "class": "net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy.RecordObjectMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy.RecordObjectMethod' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.ByteBuddy'). The class interacts with a wide variety of abstractions across different packages, including core implementation classes like 'ByteCodeAppender', 'StackManipulation', 'MethodVariableAccess', and description classes such as 'MethodDescription', 'TypeDescription', 'RecordComponentDescription'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub connecting multiple parts of the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
