    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.AndroidDescriptor.TypeScope",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class AndroidDescriptor. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub connecting to many other abstractions."
