"justification": "org.gradle.work has Ce=1 and Ca=1 => instability I=1/(1+1)=0.5. Its only outgoing dependency is org.gradle.api.provider which has Ce=0 and Ca=3 => I=0/(0+3)=0.0, i.e. more stable than org.gradle.work (0.0 < 0.5). The incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.build.gradle (Ce=8, Ca=0 => I=1.0) is an afferent relation and does not make org.gradle.work depend on a less stable package. Therefore org.gradle.work does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
