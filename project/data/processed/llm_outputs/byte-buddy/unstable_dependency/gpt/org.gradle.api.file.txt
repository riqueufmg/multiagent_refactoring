"package": "org.gradle.api.file",

"justification": "org.gradle.api.file has Ce=1 and Ca=1 (instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 1/2 = 0.5). Its single outgoing dependency is org.gradle.api.provider which has Ce=0 and Ca=3 (I = 0/(3+0) = 0.0), i.e. more stable. The dependency direction (org.gradle.api.file -> org.gradle.api.provider) goes from higher instability to lower instability, satisfying the Stable Dependencies Principle. The incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.build.gradle (Ce=8, Ca=0, I=1.0) is from a less stable package to org.gradle.api.file and does not indicate org.gradle.api.file depending on a less stable package. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
