  "package": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.specimen",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "The package has Ce=0 (no outgoing dependencies) and Ca=1 (one incoming dependency). Its instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 0/(1+0) = 0 (maximally stable). It does not depend on any other packages, so it cannot depend on less stable components. The single incoming dependency is from net.bytebuddy.benchmark (Ce=7, Ca=0, I = 7/(7+0) = 1, i.e. unstable), so the dependency direction is from an unstable package to this stable package, which does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
