  "justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=11, Ca=25 => instability I=11/(11+25)=0.306. It has 11 outgoing dependencies; 6 of them are less stable (higher instability) than the analyzed package, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. Offending outgoing dependencies (instability I): net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher (6/(6+8)=0.429), net.bytebuddy.utility (16/(16+25)=0.390), net.bytebuddy.build (19/(19+36)=0.345), net.bytebuddy (25/(25+26)=0.490), net.bytebuddy.description.type (16/(16+32)=0.333), net.bytebuddy.description.annotation (12/(12+19)=0.387). The analyzed package also has a relatively high Ca=25 (many incoming dependents), which makes depending on these less stable packages a design smell. Therefore Unstable Dependency is detected."
