"package": "net.bytebuddy.description",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The analyzed package has Ce=4 and Ca=12 -> instability I=4/(12+4)=0.25 (relatively stable). Of its outgoing dependencies: net.bytebuddy.description.type (Ce=16, Ca=32 -> I=0.333), net.bytebuddy.matcher (Ce=9, Ca=23 -> I=0.281), net.bytebuddy.description.method (Ce=11, Ca=25 -> I=0.306), net.bytebuddy.description.modifier (Ce=1, Ca=16 -> I=0.059). Three of four outgoing dependencies (description.type I=0.333, matcher I=0.281, description.method I=0.306) have higher instability than net.bytebuddy.description (I=0.25), meaning the package depends on less stable packages. Additionally, the package has more incoming than outgoing ties (Ca>Ce), reinforcing that it is relatively stable and should not depend on more unstable components. These facts constitute an Unstable Dependency smell (violation of the Stable Dependencies Principle)."
