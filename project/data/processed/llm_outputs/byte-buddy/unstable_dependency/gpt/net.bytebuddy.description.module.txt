"justification": "Stable metric I = Ca/(Ca+Ce) for net.bytebuddy.description.module = 9/(9+8) = 0.529. It has outgoing dependencies to multiple packages; two of them are less stable (I lower than 0.529): net.bytebuddy.dynamic (Ca=22, Ce=24, I=22/46 = 0.478) and net.bytebuddy (Ca=26, Ce=25, I=26/51 = 0.510). Depending on these less-stable packages violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, therefore an Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
