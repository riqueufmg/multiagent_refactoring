"justification": "Analyzed package net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor has Ce=6, Ca=3 -> instability I = 6/(6+3) = 0.667. Its outgoing dependencies are to packages that are more stable (lower I): net.bytebuddy.utility (Ce=16, Ca=25, I=0.390), net.bytebuddy.dynamic (Ce=24, Ca=22, I=0.522), net.bytebuddy.build (Ce=19, Ca=36, I=0.346), net.bytebuddy.description.method (Ce=11, Ca=25, I=0.306), net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode (Ce=4, Ca=22, I=0.154), net.bytebuddy.implementation (Ce=23, Ca=25, I=0.479). Because all outgoing dependencies have lower instability than net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor, the Stable Dependency Principle is respected and there is no unstable-dependency smell. (Incoming packages: net.bytebuddy.dynamic I=0.522, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold I=0.615, net.bytebuddy.asm I=0.677 — although net.bytebuddy.asm is marginally less stable than this package, it is an incoming dependency (it depends on net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor), so it does not cause an unstable dependency for net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor.)"
