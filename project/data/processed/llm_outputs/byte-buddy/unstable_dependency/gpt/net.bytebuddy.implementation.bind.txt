"package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package is unstable (Ce=8, Ca=3 -> instability I=8/(8+3)=0.727). It has an outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation which is less stable (Ce=20, Ca=3 -> I=20/(20+3)=0.870). Depending on a package with higher instability violates the Stable Dependencies Principle. Additionally this dependency is mutual (net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation appears in the package's outgoing list and in its incoming list), increasing fragility. Most other outgoing dependencies are more stable (examples: net.bytebuddy.build I≈0.345, net.bytebuddy.description.type I≈0.333, net.bytebuddy.implementation I≈0.479), but the presence of the dependency on net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation constitutes an unstable-dependency smell for this package."
