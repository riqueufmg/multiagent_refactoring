"justification": "The package has Ca=12 and Ce=5 -> stability I = 12/(12+5) = 0.706. It has outgoing dependencies to: net.bytebuddy.build (Ca=36, Ce=19 -> I=36/55 = 0.655), net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode (Ca=22, Ce=4 -> I=22/26 = 0.846), net.bytebuddy.description.type (Ca=32, Ce=16 -> I=32/48 = 0.667), net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference (Ca=1, Ce=5 -> I=1/6 = 0.167), net.bytebuddy.implementation (Ca=25, Ce=23 -> I=25/48 = 0.521). According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, this package (I=0.706) should depend only on packages with equal or higher stability. Four of its five outgoing dependencies (net.bytebuddy.build I=0.655, net.bytebuddy.description.type I=0.667, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference I=0.167, net.bytebuddy.implementation I=0.521) have lower stability than it does, which constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell. Only net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode (I=0.846) is more stable."
