"justification": "Analyzed package net.bytebuddy.utility.privilege has Ce=1, Ca=1 (instability I = 1/(1+1) = 0.5). Its sole outgoing dependency is net.bytebuddy.build (Ce=19, Ca=36, I = 19/(19+36) ≈ 0.345), which is more stable (lower instability) than the analyzed package. Incoming dependency net.bytebuddy.utility (Ce=16, Ca=25, I ≈ 0.390) depends on the analyzed package but does not create an unstable dependency. Since the package only depends on a more stable package, the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
