"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=3, Ca=7 => stability I = Ca/(Ca+Ce) = 7/(7+3) = 0.70. Outgoing dependencies: 1) net.bytebuddy.description.type: Ce=16, Ca=32 => I = 32/(16+32) = 0.6667 (less stable than 0.70). 2) net.bytebuddy.build: Ce=19, Ca=36 => I = 36/(19+36) = 0.6545 (less stable than 0.70). 3) net.bytebuddy.description.method: Ce=11, Ca=25 => I = 25/(11+25) = 0.6944 (slightly less stable than 0.70). Because the package depends on these packages whose stability indices are all lower than its own stability, it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle and exhibits the Unstable Dependency smell. Incoming dependency count (Ca=7) shows the package is relatively stable externally, reinforcing that depending on less stable packages is a design smell."
