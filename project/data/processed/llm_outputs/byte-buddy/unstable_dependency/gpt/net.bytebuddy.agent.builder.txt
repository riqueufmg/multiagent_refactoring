"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=23, Ca=1 -> instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 23/24 = 0.958. The Unstable Dependency smell would occur if this package depended on packages with higher instability (i.e. less stable) than 0.958. All outgoing dependencies have lower instability than 0.958 (examples: net.bytebuddy.dynamic I=0.522, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold I=0.615, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign I=0.294, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading I=0.441, net.bytebuddy.description.method I=0.306, net.bytebuddy.asm I=0.677, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline I=0.741, net.bytebuddy I=0.490). The single incoming dependency (net.bytebuddy, I=0.490) is also more stable. Because every outgoing dependency is more stable (has lower I) than net.bytebuddy.agent.builder, the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated and no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
