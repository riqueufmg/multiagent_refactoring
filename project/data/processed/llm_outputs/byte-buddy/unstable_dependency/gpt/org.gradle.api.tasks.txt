"package": "org.gradle.api.tasks",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has Ce=0 and Ca=2 (instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 0.0), and no outgoing dependencies. It does not depend on any other packages (outgoing_dependencies empty), so it cannot depend on less-stable packages. Incoming dependencies come from net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android (Ce=9, Ca=0) and net.bytebuddy.build.gradle (Ce=8, Ca=0) which are unstable but depend on org.gradle.api.tasks. Dependency direction is toward the more stable package, so the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
