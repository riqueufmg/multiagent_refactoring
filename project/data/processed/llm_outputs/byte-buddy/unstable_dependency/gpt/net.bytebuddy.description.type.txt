  "detection": true,
  "justification": "Analyzed package net.bytebuddy.description.type has Ce=16, Ca=32 => instability I=16/(16+32)=0.333. It has 16 outgoing dependencies; 11 of them have higher instability (i.e. are less stable) than 0.333, indicating an unstable dependency direction. Offending outgoing dependencies (Ce, Ca, I): net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher (6,8,0.429), net.bytebuddy.utility (16,25,0.390), net.bytebuddy.dynamic (24,22,0.522), net.bytebuddy.asm (23,11,0.677), net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold (24,15,0.615), net.bytebuddy.description.module (8,9,0.471), net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading (15,19,0.441), net.bytebuddy.build (19,36,0.345), net.bytebuddy (25,26,0.490), net.bytebuddy.description.annotation (12,19,0.387), net.bytebuddy.implementation (23,25,0.479). Only 5 outgoing dependencies are more stable (lower I). Because net.bytebuddy.description.type depends on many packages that are less stable than itself, it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle — therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
