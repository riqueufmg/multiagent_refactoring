"package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary",
"detection": true,
"justification": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary has Ce=17, Ca=9 => instability I = 17/(17+9) = 0.654. It has an outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass which has Ce=20, Ca=9 => I = 20/(20+9) = 0.690, i.e. more unstable (higher I) than the analyzed package. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle (a package depending on a less stable package). Other outgoing dependencies (e.g. net.bytebuddy.utility I=0.390, net.bytebuddy.matcher I=0.281, net.bytebuddy.dynamic I=0.522, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode I=0.154) are more stable, but the dependency on net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass (I=0.690 > 0.654) is sufficient to flag an Unstable Dependency smell."
