"detection": false,
"justification": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation has Ce=20 and Ca=3 => stability I = 3/(3+20) = 0.130. The Stable Dependencies Principle is violated only if this package depends on packages with lower stability (I < 0.130). Its outgoing dependencies have higher stability values: examples — net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection I=0.200, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind I=0.273, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass I=0.310, net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary I=0.346, net.bytebuddy.dynamic I=0.478, net.bytebuddy.implementation I=0.521, net.bytebuddy.build I=0.655, etc. The minimum outgoing dependency stability is 0.200, which is greater than 0.130, so it does not depend on less stable components. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
