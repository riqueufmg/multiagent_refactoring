"justification": "Analyzed package instability I = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 24/(24+15) ≈ 0.615. It depends on multiple packages whose instability is higher than 0.615, i.e. they are less stable: net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass (Ce=20, Ca=9, I≈0.690), net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor (Ce=6, Ca=3, I≈0.667), net.bytebuddy.asm (Ce=23, Ca=11, I≈0.676), net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary (Ce=17, Ca=9, I≈0.654), net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline (Ce=20, Ca=7, I≈0.741). Because the package depends on these less stable packages (higher I), the Stable Dependencies Principle is violated and the Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
