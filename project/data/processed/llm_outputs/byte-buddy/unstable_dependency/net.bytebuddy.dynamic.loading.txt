"justification": "Analyzed package stability I = Ca/(Ca+Ce) = 19/(19+15) = 0.559. It has 15 outgoing dependencies; 6 of them are less stable (I < 0.559): net.bytebuddy.dynamic (Ca=22, Ce=24, I=0.478), net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold (Ca=15, Ce=24, I=0.385), net.bytebuddy.description.module (Ca=9, Ce=8, I=0.529), net.bytebuddy (Ca=26, Ce=25, I=0.510), net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass (Ca=9, Ce=20, I=0.310), net.bytebuddy.implementation (Ca=25, Ce=23, I=0.521). Several of these (for example net.bytebuddy.dynamic and net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold) also list net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading among their dependencies (incoming), indicating mutual/cyclic dependencies that exacerbate the violation of the Stable Dependencies Principle. Because the package depends on multiple less-stable components and has cyclic ties with them, the Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
