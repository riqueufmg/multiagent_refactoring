"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.implementation' has a stability metric (I) of 0.48, calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 23/(25+23). Several of its outgoing dependencies have lower stability (higher I values), such as 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind' (I = 0.73), 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute' (I = 0.53), and 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign' (I = 0.30). However, it also depends on more stable packages like 'net.bytebuddy.description.modifier' (I = 0.06). The presence of dependencies on less stable packages violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, indicating an Unstable Dependency smell."
