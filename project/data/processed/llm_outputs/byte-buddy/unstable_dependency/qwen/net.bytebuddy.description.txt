"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.description' has a stability value (I) of 0.25, calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 4/(12+4). Among its outgoing dependencies, 'net.bytebuddy.description.method' has I=0.31, 'net.bytebuddy.description.type' has I=0.33, 'net.bytebuddy.description.modifier' has I=0.06, and 'net.bytebuddy.matcher' has I=0.28. While some dependencies like 'net.bytebuddy.description.method' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type' are less stable (higher I values) than the analyzed package, the overall dependency structure does not consistently violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Additionally, many of its incoming dependencies are more stable (lower I values), which supports appropriate dependency direction. Therefore, it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
