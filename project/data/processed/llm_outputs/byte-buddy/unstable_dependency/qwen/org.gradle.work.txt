{
"package": "org.gradle.work",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.gradle.work has stability of 0.25 (Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 1/(1+3) = 1/4 = 0.25). It depends on org.gradle.api.provider which has stability of 0 (Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 0/(0+3) = 0). Since org.gradle.work (stability 0.25) depends on org.gradle.api.provider (stability 0), and 0.25 > 0, this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle - the more stable package (org.gradle.api.provider with stability 0) is depended upon by the less stable package (org.gradle.work with stability 0.25)."
