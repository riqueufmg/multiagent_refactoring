"package": "net.bytebuddy.agent",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.agent' depends on 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic', which is less stable. The stability of 'net.bytebuddy.agent' is 0.86 (Ce=1, Ca=4, Stability = Ce/(Ce+Ca)), while the stability of 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' is 0.52 (Ce=24, Ca=22, Stability = Ce/(Ce+Ca)). According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Since 'net.bytebuddy.agent' (stability 0.86) depends on 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' (stability 0.52), which is less stable, this constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell."
