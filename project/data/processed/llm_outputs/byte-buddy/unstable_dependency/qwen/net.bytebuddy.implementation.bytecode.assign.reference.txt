Among its outgoing dependencies, 'net.bytebuddy.implementation' has I = 0.48, 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode' has I = 0.15, 'net.bytebuddy.build' has I = 0.35, 'net.bytebuddy.description.type' has I = 0.33, and 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign' has I = 0.29. All these dependencies are more stable (lower I values) than the analyzed package, which complies with the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
