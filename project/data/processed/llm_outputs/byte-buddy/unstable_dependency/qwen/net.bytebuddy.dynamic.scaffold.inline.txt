"package": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline' has outgoing dependencies on packages that are less stable than itself. For example, it depends on 'net.bytebuddy.build' (Ce=19, Ca=36), which has a higher afferent coupling (Ca) and lower efferent coupling (Ce) compared to the analyzed package, indicating that 'net.bytebuddy.build' is more stable. However, the analyzed package also depends on 'net.bytebuddy.asm' (Ce=23, Ca=11), which has lower afferent coupling and higher efferent coupling, making it less stable. Since the analyzed package depends on less stable packages like 'net.bytebuddy.asm', it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle."
