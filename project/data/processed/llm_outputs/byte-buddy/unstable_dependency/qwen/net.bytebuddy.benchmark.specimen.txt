"justification": "The package has no outgoing dependencies (Ce=0), making it impossible to violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. While it has one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.benchmark' (Ca=1), the absence of outgoing dependencies means there are no unstable dependencies to evaluate."
