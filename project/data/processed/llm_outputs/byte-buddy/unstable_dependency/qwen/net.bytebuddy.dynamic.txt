"package": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' has outgoing dependencies to several other packages. To determine if it has an Unstable Dependency, we need to check if it depends on packages that are less stable than itself. Stability is calculated as Ce / (Ce + Ca), where Ce is efferent couplings and Ca is afferent couplings. For 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic', Ce = 24 and Ca = 22, so its stability is 24 / (24 + 22) = 24/46 ≈ 0.52. We then compare this value with the stability of each outgoing dependency. All outgoing dependencies have stability values greater than or equal to 0.52, meaning 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' does not depend on less stable packages. Therefore, it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
