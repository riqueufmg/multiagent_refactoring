```json
{
"package": "net.bytebuddy.utility.privilege",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.utility.privilege' has an instability value of 0.5 (Ce=1, Ca=1), while its outgoing dependency 'net.bytebuddy.build' has an instability value of 0.35 (Ce=19, Ca=36). According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should only depend on packages that are more stable (less unstable) than itself. Since 'net.bytebuddy.utility.privilege' depends on a more stable package, this constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell."
