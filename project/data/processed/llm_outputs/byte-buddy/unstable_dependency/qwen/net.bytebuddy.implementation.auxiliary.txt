"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary' depends on several packages that are less stable (higher Ce/Ca ratio or equal stability) such as 'net.bytebuddy.implementation' (Ce=23, Ca=25), 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading' (Ce=15, Ca=19), 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' (Ce=24, Ca=22), and 'net.bytebuddy' (Ce=25, Ca=26). These dependencies violate the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
