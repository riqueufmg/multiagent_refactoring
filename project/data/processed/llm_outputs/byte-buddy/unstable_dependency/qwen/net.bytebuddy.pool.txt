"package": "net.bytebuddy.pool",

"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.pool' has a stability metric (Ce=15, Ca=11) indicating it is less stable than some of the packages it depends on. It depends on 'net.bytebuddy.description.annotation' (Ce=12, Ca=19), 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' (Ce=24, Ca=22), and 'net.bytebuddy.build' (Ce=19, Ca=36), which are more stable or equally stable, but also depends on 'net.bytebuddy.matcher' (Ce=9, Ca=23) and 'net.bytebuddy.description' (Ce=4, Ca=12), which are more stable (lower Ce). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle as 'net.bytebuddy.pool' is unstable and depends on more stable packages, creating an unstable dependency smell."
