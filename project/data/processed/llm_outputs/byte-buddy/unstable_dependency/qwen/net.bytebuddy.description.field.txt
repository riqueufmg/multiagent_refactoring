"package": "net.bytebuddy.description.field",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.description.field' depends on packages that are less stable than itself. Specifically, it depends on 'net.bytebuddy.build' (I = 0.34, stability = 0.42), 'net.bytebuddy.matcher' (I = 0.23, stability = 0.28), and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type' (I = 0.39, stability = 0.34). These dependencies violate the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
