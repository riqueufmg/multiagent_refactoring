"package": "net.bytebuddy.android",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.android' has a stability metric (Ce/(Ce+Ca)) of 1.0, as it has 7 efferent couplings (Ce) and 0 afferent couplings (Ca). All of its outgoing dependencies are to packages that are less stable than itself, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. For example, 'net.bytebuddy.implementation' has stability 0.48 (23/(23+25)), 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading' has stability 0.44 (15/(15+19)), and similarly other dependencies have lower stability. Therefore, 'net.bytebuddy.android' depends on less stable packages, constituting an Unstable Dependency smell."
