"package": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation",

"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.description.annotation' has outgoing dependencies to several other packages. To determine if it has an Unstable Dependency, we must check if it depends on packages that are less stable (i.e., have higher instability index (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) than itself). However, the outgoing dependencies include packages like 'net.bytebuddy.description.field' (I = 6/25 = 0.24), 'net.bytebuddy.matcher' (I = 9/32 ≈ 0.28), and others which may be less stable. But since the incoming dependencies show that many packages depend on this package, indicating it is relatively stable (Ca = 19), and its own instability index is I = 12/(19+12) ≈ 0.39, it does not clearly violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
