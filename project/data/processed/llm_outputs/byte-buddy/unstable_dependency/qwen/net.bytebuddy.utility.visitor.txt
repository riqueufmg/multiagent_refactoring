"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor' has a stability metric (Ce/(Ce+Ca)) of 6/(6+3) = 0.6667. It depends on packages including 'net.bytebuddy.implementation' (stability = 23/(23+25) = 0.4792), 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' (stability = 24/(24+22) = 0.5217), and 'net.bytebuddy.build' (stability = 19/(19+36) = 0.3455), all of which are less stable than 'net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor'. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which requires a package to depend only on packages that are more stable than itself. Therefore, an Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
