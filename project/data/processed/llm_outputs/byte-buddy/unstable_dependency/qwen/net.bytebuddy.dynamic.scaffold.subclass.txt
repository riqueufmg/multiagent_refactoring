"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass' has a stability metric (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) of 0.69. It depends on packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.asm' (I = 0.68) and 'net.bytebuddy.build' (I = 0.35), which are less stable or equally stable. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, this package should only depend on more stable packages, thus constituting an Unstable Dependency smell."
