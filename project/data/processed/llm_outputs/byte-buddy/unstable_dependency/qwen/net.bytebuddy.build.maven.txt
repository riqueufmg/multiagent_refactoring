"package": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven",

"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.build.maven' has a stability metric (I) of 1.0, calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 7/(0+7), indicating it is completely unstable. It depends on packages like 'net.bytebuddy.implementation' (I=0.48), 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' (I=0.52), and 'net.bytebuddy.build' (I=0.35), which are more stable than itself. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Therefore, an Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
