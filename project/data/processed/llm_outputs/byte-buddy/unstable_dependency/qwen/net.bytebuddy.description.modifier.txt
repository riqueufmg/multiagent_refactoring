"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.description.modifier' has a stability metric (I) of 0.94, calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 1/(16+1) = 1/17 ≈ 0.06, indicating it is highly stable. It depends on 'net.bytebuddy.build', which has a stability metric (I) of 0.53, calculated as 19/(36+19) = 19/55 ≈ 0.35. Since the analyzed package is more stable than the package it depends on, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle, and therefore, the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
