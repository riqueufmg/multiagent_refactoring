"package": "net.bytebuddy.description.enumeration",

"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.description.enumeration' has outgoing dependencies on 'net.bytebuddy.build', 'net.bytebuddy.description.method', and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type'. To determine if it has an unstable dependency, we must compare its stability (I) with the stability of its dependencies. The instability (I) is calculated as Ce / (Ca + Ce). For this package, I = 3 / (7 + 3) = 0.3. The outgoing dependencies have the following instabilities: 'net.bytebuddy.build' (I = 19 / (36 + 19) = 0.35), 'net.bytebuddy.description.method' (I = 11 / (25 + 11) = 0.31), and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type' (I = 16 / (32 + 16) = 0.33). Since all outgoing dependencies have higher instability values than the package itself, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
