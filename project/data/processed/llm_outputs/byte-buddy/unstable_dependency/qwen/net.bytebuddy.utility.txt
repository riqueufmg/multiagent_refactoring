"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.utility' has outgoing dependencies to packages that are less stable than itself. Stability is calculated as Ce / (Ce + Ca). For 'net.bytebuddy.utility', stability is 16 / (16 + 25) = 0.39. Some of its outgoing dependencies, such as 'net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher' (stability = 6 / (6 + 8) = 0.43) and 'net.bytebuddy.utility.privilege' (stability = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5), are more stable or equally stable. However, other dependencies like 'net.bytebuddy.description.annotation' (stability = 12 / (12 + 19) = 0.39), 'net.bytebuddy.description.field' (stability = 6 / (6 + 19) = 0.24), and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type' (stability = 16 / (16 + 32) = 0.33) are less stable. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
