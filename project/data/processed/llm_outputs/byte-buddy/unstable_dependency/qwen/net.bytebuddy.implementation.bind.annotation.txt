"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation' has a stability value (I) of 0.8696, calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 20/(3+20). Most of its outgoing dependencies have lower stability values, meaning it depends on more stable packages. For example, 'net.bytebuddy.description.modifier' has I=0.0588, 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection' has I=0.8, and 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign' has I=0.2941. Since this package depends on packages that are as stable or more stable than itself, it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
