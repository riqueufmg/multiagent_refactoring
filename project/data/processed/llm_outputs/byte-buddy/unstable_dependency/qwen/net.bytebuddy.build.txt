"package": "net.bytebuddy.build",

"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.build' has outgoing dependencies to 19 other packages. To determine if it has an Unstable Dependency, we need to check the stability of its dependencies. Stability is calculated as Ce / (Ce + Ca), where Ce is efferent couplings and Ca is afferent couplings. For example, 'net.bytebuddy.description.modifier' has Ce=1 and Ca=16, giving it a stability of 1/17≈0.059. Most of its dependencies have low Ce and high Ca, indicating they are stable. The package 'net.bytebuddy.build' itself has Ce=19 and Ca=36, giving it a stability of 19/55≈0.345. Since it depends on packages that are more stable than itself (e.g., 'net.bytebuddy.description.modifier' with stability ~0.059), it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
