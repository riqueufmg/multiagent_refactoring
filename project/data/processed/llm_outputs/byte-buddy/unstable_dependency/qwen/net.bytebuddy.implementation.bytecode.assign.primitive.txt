"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive' has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0), meaning it is unstable (I=1). All its outgoing dependencies are to packages with lower instability values (higher stability), satisfying the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
