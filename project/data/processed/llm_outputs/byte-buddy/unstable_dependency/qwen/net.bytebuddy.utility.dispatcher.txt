"package": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher' depends on 'net.bytebuddy.build', which has a higher instability (Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 19/(19+36) = 0.345) than itself (instability = 6/(6+8) = 0.429). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, as an unstable package should not depend on a more stable one."
