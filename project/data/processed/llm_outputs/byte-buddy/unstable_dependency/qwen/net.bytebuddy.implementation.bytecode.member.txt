"package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member' has outgoing dependencies to several other packages. To determine if it has an Unstable Dependency smell, we need to check if it depends on packages that are less stable than itself. Stability is typically measured as the ratio of incoming dependencies (Ca) to the sum of incoming and outgoing dependencies (Ca + Ce). The stability of 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member' is Ca/(Ca+Ce) = 11/(11+12) ≈ 0.478. We then compare this to the stability of its outgoing dependencies. For example, 'net.bytebuddy.description.field' has stability 19/(19+6) = 0.76, which is more stable, so this dependency is acceptable. Repeating this for all outgoing dependencies shows that all dependencies are to packages that are as stable or more stable than 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member'. Therefore, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
