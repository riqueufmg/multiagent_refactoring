"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.agent.builder' has a stability metric (Ce/(Ce+Ca)) of 23/(23+1) = 0.958, indicating it is highly unstable. It depends on packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline' (stability = 20/(20+7) = 0.741), 'net.bytebuddy.asm' (stability = 23/(23+11) = 0.676), and 'net.bytebuddy.implementation' (stability = 23/(23+25) = 0.479), which are less stable or equally unstable. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
