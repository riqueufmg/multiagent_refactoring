"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading' has a stability metric (Ca=19, Ce=15) that indicates it is relatively unstable (instability = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 15/34 ≈ 0.44). It depends on several packages, including 'net.bytebuddy.description.field' (Ca=19, Ce=6, instability ≈ 0.24), 'net.bytebuddy.implementation' (Ca=25, Ce=23, instability ≈ 0.48), and others. Some of these dependencies like 'net.bytebuddy.description.modifier' (Ca=16, Ce=1, instability ≈ 0.06) are more stable. However, the dependency on 'net.bytebuddy.implementation' which has higher instability than itself violates the Stable Dependencies Principle. Additionally, it depends on 'net.bytebuddy.matcher' (Ca=23, Ce=9, instability ≈ 0.28), which is more stable, but also on packages with similar or greater instability, indicating unstable dependency patterns."
