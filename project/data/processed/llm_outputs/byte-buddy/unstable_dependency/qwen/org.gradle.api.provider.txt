"package": "org.gradle.api.provider",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.gradle.api.provider has no outgoing dependencies (Ce=0), making it maximally stable (stability=1.0). It has incoming dependencies from packages net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android (Ce=9), org.gradle.work (Ce=1), and org.gradle.api.file (Ce=1). Since org.gradle.api.provider is maximally stable, it does not depend on less stable packages, thus not violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
