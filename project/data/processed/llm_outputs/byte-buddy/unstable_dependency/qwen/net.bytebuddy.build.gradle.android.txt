"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android' depends on several packages that are less stable than itself. Specifically, it depends on 'net.bytebuddy.asm' (stability = 0.677), 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline' (stability = 0.741), 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' (stability = 0.522), 'net.bytebuddy' (stability = 0.490), 'net.bytebuddy.build' (stability = 0.346), 'net.bytebuddy.pool' (stability = 0.577), and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type' (stability = 0.327). These dependencies violate the Stable Dependencies Principle because they are less stable (higher instability values) than the analyzed package, which has an instability value of 1.0 due to having no incoming dependencies (Ca=0)."
