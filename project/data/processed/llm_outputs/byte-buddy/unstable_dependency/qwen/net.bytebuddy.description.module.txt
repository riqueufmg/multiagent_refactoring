"justification": "The package 'net.bytebuddy.description.module' has a stability metric (Ce/(Ce+Ca)) of 8/(8+9) = 0.47. It depends on packages like 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' (stability = 24/(24+22) = 0.52), 'net.bytebuddy' (stability = 25/(25+26) = 0.49), and 'net.bytebuddy.utility' (stability = 16/(16+25) = 0.39). While some dependencies are less stable, others are more stable. However, the dependency on 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' violates the Stable Dependencies Principle because it is less stable (0.52) than the analyzed package (0.47)."
