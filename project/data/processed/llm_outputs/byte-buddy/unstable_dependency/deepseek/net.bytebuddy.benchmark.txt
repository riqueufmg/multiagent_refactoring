  "package": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark",

  "justification": "The analyzed package has Ca=0 (no incoming dependencies) and Ce=7 (7 outgoing dependencies), resulting in a stability index of 0 (unstable). All outgoing dependencies have higher stability indices (Ca>0 and Ce>0, stability >0) or equal stability (Ca=0, Ce=0, stability=1), meaning they are more stable or equally stable. No dependency has a lower stability index than the analyzed package."
