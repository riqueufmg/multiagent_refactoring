  "justification": "The package has no outgoing dependencies (Ce=0) and does not depend on any other packages, so there are no less stable components it depends on. Additionally, the package has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0), indicating it is currently independent, and the Stability metric (S=0) is not meaningful for comparison as there are no dependencies to evaluate against the Stable Dependencies Principle."
