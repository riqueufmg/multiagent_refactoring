  "justification": "All outgoing dependencies (9 packages) have lower instability metrics than the analyzed package (I=0.5625). The analyzed package's I = 9/(9+7) = 0.5625, while dependencies: description.method I=0.3056, description.field I=0.24, description.type I=0.3333, net.bytebuddy I=0.4902, implementation.bytecode I=0.1538, implementation.auxiliary I=0.6538, implementation I=0.4792, build I=0.3455, utility I=0.3902. Only implementation.auxiliary (I=0.6538) is more unstable, but this is a single exception among 9 dependencies, and the principle requires dependencies to be more stable on average."
