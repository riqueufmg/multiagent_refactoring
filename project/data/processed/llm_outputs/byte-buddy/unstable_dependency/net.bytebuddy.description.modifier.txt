"justification": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier has Ce=1 and Ca=16 (instability I = 1/(1+16) ≈ 0.059). It has an outgoing dependency only to net.bytebuddy.build, which has Ce=19 and Ca=36 (instability I = 19/(19+36) ≈ 0.345). Because the analyzed package is much more stable (lower I) than the package it depends on (higher I), the dependency direction is from a more stable package to a less stable one — violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. Incoming coupling (Ca=16) shows many packages depend on net.bytebuddy.description.modifier, reinforcing that it is a stable package; its dependence on the less stable net.bytebuddy.build is therefore an unstable dependency smell."
