"package": "net.bytebuddy.agent",
"detection": true,
"justification": "net.bytebuddy.agent has Ce=1 and Ca=4 (instability I = 1/(1+4) = 0.20) and its outgoing dependency is net.bytebuddy.dynamic which has Ce=24 and Ca=22 (instability I = 24/(24+22) ≈ 0.52). Because net.bytebuddy.agent (more stable, lower I) depends on net.bytebuddy.dynamic (less stable, higher I), this violates the Stable Dependencies Principle and constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell."
