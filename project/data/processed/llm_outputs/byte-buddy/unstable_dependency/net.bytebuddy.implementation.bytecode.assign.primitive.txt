Outgoing dependencies and their stabilities: net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign (Ce=5, Ca=12 -> stability=12/17≈0.706), net.bytebuddy.build (Ce=19, Ca=36 -> stability=36/55≈0.655), net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode (Ce=4, Ca=22 -> stability=22/26≈0.846), net.bytebuddy.description.type (Ce=16, Ca=32 -> stability=32/48≈0.667), net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant (Ce=9, Ca=7 -> stability=7/16≈0.438), net.bytebuddy.implementation (Ce=23, Ca=25 -> stability=25/48≈0.521). All outgoing dependencies have stability > 0 (i.e., are more stable than the analyzed package). Therefore there are no dependencies on less-stable packages and the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
