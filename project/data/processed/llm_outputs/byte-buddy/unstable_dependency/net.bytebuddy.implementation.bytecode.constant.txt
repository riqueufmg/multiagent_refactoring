"package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant",
"detection": true,
"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=9, Ca=7 -> instability I = 9/(9+7) = 0.5625. It has an outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary which has Ce=17, Ca=9 -> instability I = 17/(17+9) = 0.6538. Because net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary is less stable (higher instability) than the analyzed package, this violates the Stable Dependencies Principle (a package should depend only on packages that are more stable). All other outgoing dependencies are more stable (examples: net.bytebuddy.utility I≈0.390, net.bytebuddy.build I≈0.345, net.bytebuddy.description.method I≈0.306, net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode I≈0.154, net.bytebuddy I≈0.490, net.bytebuddy.description.field I≈0.240, net.bytebuddy.description.type I≈0.333, net.bytebuddy.implementation I≈0.479), so the presence of the dependency on net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary (I=0.6538 > 0.5625) is the reason for detecting an Unstable Dependency smell."
