"justification": "org.gradle.api.provider has no outgoing dependencies (Ce = 0) and therefore does not depend on any less-stable packages. Its afferent coupling is Ca = 3, giving stability I = Ca/(Ca+Ce) = 3/(3+0) = 1.0 (very stable). The incoming dependents are net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android (Ca=0, Ce=9, I=0.0), org.gradle.work (Ca=1, Ce=1, I=0.5) and org.gradle.api.file (Ca=1, Ce=1, I=0.5); these packages depend on org.gradle.api.provider (incoming), not the other way around. Because there are no outgoing dependencies to less stable packages, the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
