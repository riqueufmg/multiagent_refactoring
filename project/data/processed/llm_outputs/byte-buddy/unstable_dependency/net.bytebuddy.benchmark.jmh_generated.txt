"detection": false,
"justification": "No unstable dependency detected because the package has no outgoing dependencies (Ce = 0) and no incoming dependencies (Ca = 0). Both outgoing_dependencies and incoming_dependencies are empty, so it does not depend on any less-stable packages nor do other packages depend on it."
