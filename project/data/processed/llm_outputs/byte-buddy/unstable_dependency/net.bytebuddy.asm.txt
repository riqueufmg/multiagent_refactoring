"package": "net.bytebuddy.asm",
"detection": true,
"justification": "net.bytebuddy.asm has Ce=23 and Ca=11 (instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 23/34 = 0.6765). It has an outgoing dependency on net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass which has Ce=20 and Ca=9 (I = 20/29 = 0.6897). Because net.bytebuddy.asm depends on a package with higher instability (0.6897 > 0.6765), it depends on a less stable component, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. This outgoing dependency on net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass therefore constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell."
