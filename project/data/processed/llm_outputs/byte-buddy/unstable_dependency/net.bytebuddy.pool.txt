"package": "net.bytebuddy.pool",
"detection": true,
"justification": "net.bytebuddy.pool has Ce=15, Ca=11 (stability I = 11/(11+15) ≈ 0.423). It has an outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold which has Ce=24, Ca=15 (stability I = 15/(15+24) ≈ 0.385). Because net.bytebuddy.pool depends on net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold whose stability (0.385) is lower than net.bytebuddy.pool's stability (0.423), the Stable Dependencies Principle is violated (a package depends on a less stable package). All other listed outgoing dependencies have equal or higher stability than net.bytebuddy.pool, so there is one clear unstable dependency (net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold) causing the smell."
