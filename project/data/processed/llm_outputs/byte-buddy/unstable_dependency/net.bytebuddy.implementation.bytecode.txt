"justification": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode has Ce=4 and Ca=22 -> instability I = 4/(22+4) = 0.154 (relatively stable). Its outgoing dependencies are less stable (higher I): net.bytebuddy.description.type (Ce=16, Ca=32, I=16/48=0.333), net.bytebuddy.build (Ce=19, Ca=36, I=19/55=0.345), net.bytebuddy.description.method (Ce=11, Ca=25, I=11/36=0.306), net.bytebuddy.implementation (Ce=23, Ca=25, I=23/48=0.479). Because this package (low I) depends on packages with higher instability (higher I), it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle and exhibits the Unstable Dependency smell."
