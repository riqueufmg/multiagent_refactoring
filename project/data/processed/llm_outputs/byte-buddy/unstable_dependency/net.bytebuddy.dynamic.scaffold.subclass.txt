"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=20, Ca=9 -> Instability I = 20/(20+9) = 0.6897. All outgoing dependencies have instability <= 0.6897 (examples: net.bytebuddy.dynamic I=0.5217, net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold I=0.6154, net.bytebuddy.asm I=0.6765, net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary I=0.6538, net.bytebuddy.pool I=0.5769, net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute I=0.5294). Since the package only depends on packages with equal or lower instability (i.e., more stable), it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Incoming dependencies include a mix of packages (e.g., net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading I=0.4412, net.bytebuddy.implementation I=0.4792, net.bytebuddy.agent.builder I=0.9583), but these do not create an unstable-dependency smell for the analyzed package because the smell is about the analyzed package depending on less stable packages, which is not the case here."
