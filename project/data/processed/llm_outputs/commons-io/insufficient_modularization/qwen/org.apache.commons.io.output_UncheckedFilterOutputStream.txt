    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.UncheckedFilterOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7) and 6 public methods (nopm=6), with 77 lines of code (loc=77). While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the metric values do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant a classification of Insufficient Modularization. The low method count and moderate LOC suggest appropriate modularization for this class's responsibilities."
