    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 33 lines of code (loc=33), which is relatively small. With 0 fields (nof=0) and only 4 weighted methods (wmc=4), the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its current functionality."
