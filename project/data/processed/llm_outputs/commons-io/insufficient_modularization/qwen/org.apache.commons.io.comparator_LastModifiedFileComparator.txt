{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.LastModifiedFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 4 lines of code (loc=36), and a low weighted method count (wmc=4). The lack of class dependencies (dit=1, fanin=0, fanout=0) and good cohesion (lcom=1.0) indicate proper modularization. The small size and simple functionality suggest this class is appropriately decomposed for its purpose."
