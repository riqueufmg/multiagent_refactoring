    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOExceptionList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 88 lines of code (loc=88), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=12) indicates low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-focused with a single responsibility. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion among methods. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains reasonable size and complexity metrics."
