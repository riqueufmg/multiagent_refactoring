    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.NameFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 64 lines of code (loc=64). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=4), indicating simple method complexity. The Lack of Cohesion metric is 0.0 (lcom=0.0), suggesting good cohesion among methods. With only 8 fields (nof=8, nopf=6) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
