    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.SimplePathVisitor.AbstractBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 26 lines of code (loc=26). The low number of methods and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition is not necessary as the class is already sufficiently simple and small."
