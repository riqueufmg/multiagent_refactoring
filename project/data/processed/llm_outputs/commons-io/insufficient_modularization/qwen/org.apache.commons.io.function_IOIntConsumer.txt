{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIntConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to have a single responsibility. The low method count and minimal complexity do not suggest insufficient modularization."
