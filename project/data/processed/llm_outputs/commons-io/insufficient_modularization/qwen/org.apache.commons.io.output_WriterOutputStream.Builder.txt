    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.WriterOutputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 55 lines of code. It has minimal responsibilities with only 2 fields and no method invocations or dependencies. The low number of fields and methods indicates it is already well decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
