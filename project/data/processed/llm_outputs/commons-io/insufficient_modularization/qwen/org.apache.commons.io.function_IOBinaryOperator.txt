    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBinaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3) and 38 lines of code (loc=38), which indicates a small and simple class. With 0 fields (nof=0) and no inheritance (dit=1), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit complexity that would require further modularization. The low method count and simple structure suggest sufficient modularization has been achieved."
