    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.NoopPathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 23 lines of code (loc=23), with a low weighted method count (wmc=2). The lack of complexity (lcom=1.0) and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused implementation with appropriate size and complexity for its purpose."
