    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 39 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies other than a single import. The class appears to be a simple data holder or tracker class that is already sufficiently modularized for its purpose."
