    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOTriConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 42 lines of code (loc=42), which indicates a small and focused class. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be a simple functional interface or utility. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's not heavily interconnected. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class seems appropriately sized and decomposed."
