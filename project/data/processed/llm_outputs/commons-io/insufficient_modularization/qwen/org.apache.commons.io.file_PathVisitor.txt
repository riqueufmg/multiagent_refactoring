    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.PathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 6 lines of code, 2 nested classes, and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0). The metrics indicate a simple interface or abstract class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The low size and complexity metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization."
