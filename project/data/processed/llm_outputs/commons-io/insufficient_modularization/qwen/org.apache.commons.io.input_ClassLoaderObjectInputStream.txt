    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ClassLoaderObjectInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 4 weighted method complexity (wmc=4), 57 lines of code (loc=57), and 1 field (nof=1). The low number of methods and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
