    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.ReverseFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 fields (nof=2), and low lines of code (loc=31). The weighted method count (wmc=3) and lack of coupling (lcom=0.0, fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate minimal complexity. The class follows single responsibility principle with no signs of needing further decomposition."
