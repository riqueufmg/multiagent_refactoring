{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileAlterationObserver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 29 methods (nom=29) and 45 weighted methods (wmc=45), with 375 lines of code (loc=375). The high number of methods and lines of code indicates the class is large and potentially complex. The low LCOM value (0.1724137931034483) suggests good cohesion, but the sheer size and method count indicate that further decomposition could reduce its size and implementation complexity, which are characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
