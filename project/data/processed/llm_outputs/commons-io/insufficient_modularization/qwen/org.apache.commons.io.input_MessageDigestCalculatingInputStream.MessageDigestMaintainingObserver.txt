    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 20 lines of code (loc). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof) and no public fields or methods. The low metric values indicate proper modularization rather than insufficient decomposition."
