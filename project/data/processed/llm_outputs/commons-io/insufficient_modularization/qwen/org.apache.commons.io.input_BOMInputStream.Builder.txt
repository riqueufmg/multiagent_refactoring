    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BOMInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 52 lines of code (loc=52). The low number of fields and methods, combined with the relatively small size, indicates that the class is already sufficiently modularized. There is no evidence of incomplete decomposition that would benefit from further breakdown."
