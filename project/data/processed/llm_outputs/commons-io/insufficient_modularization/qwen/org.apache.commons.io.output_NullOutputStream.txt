{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.NullOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4), 45 lines of code (loc=45), and low weighted method count (wmc=4). The lack of class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused implementation with appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
