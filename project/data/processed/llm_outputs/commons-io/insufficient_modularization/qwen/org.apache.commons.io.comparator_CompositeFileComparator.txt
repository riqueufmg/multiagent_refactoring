{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.CompositeFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5), 3 fields (nof=3), and 47 lines of code (loc=47). The LCOM value is 0.0 indicating good cohesion, and it has only 1 level of inheritance (dit=1) with no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class size and complexity are within reasonable limits for a comparator implementation, and there's no indication that further decomposition would provide significant benefits."
