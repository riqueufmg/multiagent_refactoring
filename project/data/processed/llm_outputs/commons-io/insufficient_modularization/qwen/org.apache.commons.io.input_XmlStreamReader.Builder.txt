{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 55 lines of code (loc=55). The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
