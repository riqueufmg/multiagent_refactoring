{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedBufferedReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) and 109 lines of code (loc=109), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=12) indicates low complexity. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would clearly warrant further decomposition. The class appears to have a coherent responsibility as an unchecked buffered reader implementation."
