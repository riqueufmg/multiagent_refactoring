```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.buffer.PeekableInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 49 lines of code (loc=49), with a low weighted method count (wmc=6). The class is not deeply inherited (dit=1) and has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). These metrics indicate a small, simple class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already reasonably decomposed."
