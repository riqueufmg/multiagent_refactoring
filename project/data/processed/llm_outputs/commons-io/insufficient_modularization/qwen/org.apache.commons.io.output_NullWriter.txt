{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.NullWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11, nopm=11) and 106 lines of code (loc=106), which is within reasonable size limits for a focused utility class. The high LCOM value (0.909) indicates good cohesion where methods are related to each other. With only 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=2) and no complex dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class maintains a clear single responsibility of being a null writer implementation. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low complexity (wmc=11) suggest proper modularization for its intended purpose."
