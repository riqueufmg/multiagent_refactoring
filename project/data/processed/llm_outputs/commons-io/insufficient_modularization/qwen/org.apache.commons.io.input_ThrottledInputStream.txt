```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ThrottledInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 10 methods (nom=10) and weighted method count of 15 (wmc=15), which are within reasonable limits for a single class. The lines of code (loc=153) is not excessive for a class handling throttled input stream functionality. The low coupling (lcom=0.2) indicates good cohesion, and the depth of inheritance tree (dit=2) is minimal. The class contains a Builder dependency but this is a common pattern and does not indicate insufficient modularization."
