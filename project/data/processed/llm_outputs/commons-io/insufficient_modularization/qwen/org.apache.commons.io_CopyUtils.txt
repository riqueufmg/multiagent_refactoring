```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.CopyUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13, nopm=13) and 162 lines of code (loc=162), with a weighted method count of 15 (wmc=15). This indicates a relatively large and complex class that could benefit from further decomposition to improve modularity and reduce complexity. The high number of methods and lines of code suggest that the class has not been completely decomposed and contains multiple responsibilities that should be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
