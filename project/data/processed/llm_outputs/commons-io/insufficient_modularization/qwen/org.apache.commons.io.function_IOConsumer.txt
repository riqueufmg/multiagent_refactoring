{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 116 lines of code (loc=116), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=10) matches the number of methods, indicating simple method complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains good encapsulation. The lack of class-level dependencies (nc=0, dit=0) and no fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggest a relatively simple, focused class that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
