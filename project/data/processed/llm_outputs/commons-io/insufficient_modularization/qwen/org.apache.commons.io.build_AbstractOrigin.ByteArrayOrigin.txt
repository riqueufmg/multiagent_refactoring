    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 39 lines of code (loc=39). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While the class is nested (dit=3), its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple data holder or minimal implementation class."
