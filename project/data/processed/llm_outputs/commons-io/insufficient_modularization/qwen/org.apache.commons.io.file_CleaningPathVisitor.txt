{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.CleaningPathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods (nom) and 14 weighted method count (wmc), which is manageable. The lines of code (loc) at 86 is reasonable for a specialized visitor class. The lack of class dependencies (nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests good encapsulation. The low LCOM value (0.333) indicates good cohesion among methods. The inheritance depth (dit=3) is moderate. Overall, the class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality as a path visitor implementation."
