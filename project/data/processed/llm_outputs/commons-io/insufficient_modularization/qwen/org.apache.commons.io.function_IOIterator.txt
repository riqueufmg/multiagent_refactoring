    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 methods (nom=8) and 69 lines of code (loc=69), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=9) indicates low complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no public methods (nopm=0, nopf=0), this appears to be a simple interface or minimal utility class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The lack of complex dependencies and low method count suggests appropriate modularization for its functionality."
