    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.BrokenOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 9 methods (nom=9) and 84 lines of code (loc=84). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=9), indicating simple method complexity. The Lack of Cohesion metric (lcom=0.444) suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 2 fields and 1 public field, the class is small and focused. The low number of methods and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
