{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.MarkShieldInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 21 lines of code (loc=21), which indicates a small and focused implementation. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=4), suggesting low complexity. With only 4 methods, there is limited opportunity for further meaningful decomposition. The class appears to be well-modularized with a single responsibility, implementing a mark shield input stream functionality."
