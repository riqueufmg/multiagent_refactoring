```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReversedLinesFileReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 18 methods (nom), 34 weighted method count (wmc), and 375 lines of code (loc). The class also contains nested classes (FilePart, Builder) suggesting it could be further decomposed. High LCOM value (0.1666666666666666) indicates poor cohesion, and the large number of methods (17 public methods) suggests the class is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
