    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileEntry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 22 methods (nom=22) and 212 lines of code (loc=212), indicating high size and complexity. The high number of methods suggests the class may not be completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce implementation complexity. With 10 fields (nof=10) and 22 methods, the class manages significant state and behavior that could potentially be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
