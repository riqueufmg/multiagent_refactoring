    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 123 lines of code (loc=123), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=11) matches the number of methods, indicating simple method complexity. The class has no fields (nof=0) and no public fields (nopf=0), suggesting proper encapsulation. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and single nested class (nc=1) indicate straightforward design. While the class has dependencies on 4 other classes, this is not excessive and represents normal functional decomposition. The class appears to be a functional interface with appropriate size and complexity."
