{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.PathVisitorFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 38 lines of code (loc=38), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=5), and the Lack of Cohesion metric (lcom=0.4) suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 5 public methods (nopm=5), the class does not exhibit excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
