{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.FilesUncheck",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 57 methods (nom=57) with 563 lines of code (loc=563), indicating high complexity and size. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=57) is also high, suggesting the class has not been sufficiently decomposed. With 56 private methods (nopm=56) out of 57 total methods (nopf=56), this suggests many internal operations that could potentially be grouped into separate cohesive classes or modules to improve modularization."
