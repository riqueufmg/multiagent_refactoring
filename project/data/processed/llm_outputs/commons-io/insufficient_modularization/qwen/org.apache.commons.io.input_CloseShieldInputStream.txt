{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CloseShieldInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4), low lines of code (loc=38), simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1), and no class fields (nof=0, nc=0). The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=4) indicates minimal complexity. These metrics suggest the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
