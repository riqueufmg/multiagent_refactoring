    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.RandomAccessFileOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 5 public), low lines of code (61), low weighted method count (6), and reasonable LCOM value (0.333). These metrics indicate appropriate modularization without excessive complexity or size that would require further decomposition."
