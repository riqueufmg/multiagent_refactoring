    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BrokenReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 102 lines of code (loc=102), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 11, indicating moderate complexity. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion in Methods) is 0.36, which suggests reasonable cohesion. The class has minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a simple structure with only 2 fields. While there is some complexity, the class size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately sized and focused on its specific responsibility."
