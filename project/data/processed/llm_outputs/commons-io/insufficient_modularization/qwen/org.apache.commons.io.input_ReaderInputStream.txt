    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC=33 (high cyclomatic complexity), NOM=19 (many methods), LOC=272 (large size), and uses multiple dependencies including Builder pattern, IOUtils, Charsets, and CharsetEncoders suggesting functionality that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
