    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.UncheckedAppendableImpl",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class-level dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to be well-focused and adequately modularized for its size and complexity."
