```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.RandomAccessFiles",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) with 4 public methods (nopm=4), 60 lines of code (loc=60), and weighted method count of 8 (wmc=8). These metrics indicate a relatively small and simple class that does not exhibit excessive size or complexity. The low number of methods and moderate lines of code suggest the class is already reasonably decomposed and does not suffer from insufficient modularization."
