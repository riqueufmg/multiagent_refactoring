    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5), low lines of code (49), low weighted method count (7), and reasonable LCOM value (0.4). While it has 5 public methods, the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
