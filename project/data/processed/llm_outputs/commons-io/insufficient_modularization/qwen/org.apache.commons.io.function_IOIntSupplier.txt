    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIntSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 19 lines of code (loc=19), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies other than Uncheck, this class appears to be appropriately modularized for its simple functional interface purpose."
