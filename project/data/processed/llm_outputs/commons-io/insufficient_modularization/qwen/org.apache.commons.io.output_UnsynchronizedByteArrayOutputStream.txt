{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.UnsynchronizedByteArrayOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) with 13 private methods (nopm=13), indicating reasonable encapsulation. The weighted method count (wmc=16) and lines of code (loc=109) suggest moderate complexity that is appropriate for a specialized I/O utility class. The class has minimal external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no class-level dependencies (nc=0, nof=0, nopf=0), suggesting it is well-isolated. The LCOM value of -1.0 indicates good cohesion, and DIT=1 shows it's a base class without inheritance complexity. The size and complexity are justified for its specialized functionality as a byte array output stream implementation."
