{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.SuffixFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 11 methods (nom) and 121 lines of code (loc), which is within acceptable limits for a single class. The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) is 11, indicating manageable complexity. The Lack of Cohesion (lcom) is 0.4545, which is relatively low, suggesting good internal cohesion. With only 3 fields (nof) and 11 methods, the class is not overly large or complex. The depth of inheritance (dit) is 3, which is reasonable. The class appears to have a single, well-defined responsibility of filtering files by suffix, and its size and complexity are appropriate for its functionality."
