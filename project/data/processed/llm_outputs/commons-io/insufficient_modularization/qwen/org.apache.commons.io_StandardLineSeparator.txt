    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 37 lines of code (loc=37), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=3) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be properly modularized with a focused responsibility."
