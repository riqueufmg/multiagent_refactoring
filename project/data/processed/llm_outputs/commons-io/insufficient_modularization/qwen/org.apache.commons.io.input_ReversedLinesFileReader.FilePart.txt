    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReversedLinesFileReader.FilePart",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with 117 lines of code. While the LOC count is relatively high for the number of methods, the low complexity metrics (WMC=0, NC=0) and minimal field count suggest this is a simple data holder or utility class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The absence of methods (NOM=0, NOPM=0) indicates it's likely a passive data structure."
