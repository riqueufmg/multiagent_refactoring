{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17) with 11 public methods (nopm=11), high weighted method count (wmc=19), and 278 lines of code (loc=278). The high number of methods and lines of code indicates the class is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.2352941176470588) suggests methods are not tightly related, supporting the need for further modularization. The class also has dependencies on multiple other classes, indicating potential areas for extraction."
