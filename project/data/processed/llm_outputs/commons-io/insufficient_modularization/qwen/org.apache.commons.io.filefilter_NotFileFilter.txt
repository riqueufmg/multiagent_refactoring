{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.NotFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6), 2 fields (nof=2), and low lines of code (loc=58). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=6), indicating simple implementation complexity. The Lack of Cohesion metric is 0.0 (lcom=0.0), suggesting good internal cohesion. With only 6 methods and 58 lines of code, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
