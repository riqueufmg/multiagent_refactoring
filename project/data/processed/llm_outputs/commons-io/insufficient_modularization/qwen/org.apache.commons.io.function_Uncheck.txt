{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 22 methods (nom=22) with 19 private methods (nopm=19), indicating high implementation complexity. The class has 342 lines of code (loc=342) and provides unchecked versions of many functional interfaces, suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The high number of dependencies (15 functional interfaces) indicates it's handling too many responsibilities, violating the single responsibility principle. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=22) further confirms the high complexity."
