{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CharSequenceReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 14 methods and WMC of 26, but LCOM value of 0.14 indicates good cohesion. The class size (197 LOC) is reasonable for a reader implementation, and the low number of fields (6) suggests proper decomposition. No external dependencies indicate focused responsibility."
