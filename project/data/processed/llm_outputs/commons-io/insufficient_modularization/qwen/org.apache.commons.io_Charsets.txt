    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.Charsets",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=10, NOM=10, LOC=152) and appears to be a utility class with focused responsibility. The LCOM value of 0.6 indicates reasonable cohesion, and the low number of methods (10 total) and fields (7 total) suggests the class is already well-decomposed for its purpose as a Charsets utility class."
