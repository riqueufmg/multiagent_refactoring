{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.channels.CloseShieldChannel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 7 weighted method count (wmc=7), and 39 lines of code (loc=39). The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and minimal dependencies (only one dependency to CloseShieldChannelHandler) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a focused, single-responsibility component that wraps channel functionality."
