{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.CanReadFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 3 public methods (nopm=3), and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lines of code (loc=42) are minimal, indicating a small and focused class. The lack of fields (nof=4, nopf=3) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest proper modularization. The inheritance depth (dit=3) and lack of cohesion (lcom=1.0) are within acceptable ranges for a simple filter class."
