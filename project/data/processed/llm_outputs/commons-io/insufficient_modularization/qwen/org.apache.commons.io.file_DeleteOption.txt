    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.DeleteOption",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 7 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 1 nested class. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. WMC is 0, NOM is 0, and the class appears to be a simple interface or marker class with no implementation complexity that would benefit from modularization."
