    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.AutoCloseInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 24 lines of code, no fields, no methods, and no dependencies. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple builder pattern implementation with insufficient complexity to exhibit insufficient modularization."
