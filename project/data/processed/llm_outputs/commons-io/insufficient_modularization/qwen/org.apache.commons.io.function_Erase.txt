    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 methods (nom=10) with 150 lines of code (loc=150), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=10) matches the number of methods, indicating simple method complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and only 1 public method (nopm=1), the class appears to have a focused responsibility. The lack of class hierarchy (dit=0) and minimal dependencies suggest a simple, well-contained utility class rather than a complex monolithic class requiring decomposition."
