    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.LockableFileWriter.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), minimal fields (nof=2), and low lines of code (loc=58). The lack of methods and low structural complexity indicate it is already well modularized. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies suggest it is not heavily interconnected. The class appears to be a simple builder pattern implementation with appropriate decomposition."
