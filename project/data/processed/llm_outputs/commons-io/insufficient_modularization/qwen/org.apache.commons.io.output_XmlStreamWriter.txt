    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.XmlStreamWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods with a weighted method count (WMC) of 24, which indicates moderate complexity. The lines of code (LOC) at 193 is reasonable for a class handling XML stream writing functionality. The lack of fields (NOF=6, NOPF=0) and low LCOM value (0.384) suggest good cohesion. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality scope."
