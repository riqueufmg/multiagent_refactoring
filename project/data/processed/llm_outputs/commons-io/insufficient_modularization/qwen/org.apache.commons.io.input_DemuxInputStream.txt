    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.DemuxInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 40 lines of code (loc=40), with a low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lack of fields (nof=1) and simple method structure (nopm=4, nopf=0) indicates minimal complexity. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its size and functionality, showing no evidence of insufficient modularization."
