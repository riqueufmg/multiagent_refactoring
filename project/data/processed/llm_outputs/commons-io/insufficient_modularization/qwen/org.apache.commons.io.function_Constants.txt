    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.Constants",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 7 fields which is reasonable for a constants class, and 41 lines of code. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low LCOM value (0.0) indicate good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple constants container with minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
