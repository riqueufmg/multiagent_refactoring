    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.FileFilterUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 43 methods (nom=43) with 42 public static methods (nopm=42), indicating a high concentration of functionality in a single class. The large number of methods suggests insufficient decomposition, as this utility class could be further broken down into more specialized classes to reduce complexity and improve modularity. The high method count (43) and static method count (42) with significant lines of code (469 loc) indicates this class is doing too much and violates the principle of single responsibility."
