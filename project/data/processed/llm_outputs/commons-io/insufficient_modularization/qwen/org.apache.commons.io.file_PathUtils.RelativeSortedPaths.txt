    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils.RelativeSortedPaths",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 94 lines of code (loc=94). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. With such a simple structure and low complexity, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
