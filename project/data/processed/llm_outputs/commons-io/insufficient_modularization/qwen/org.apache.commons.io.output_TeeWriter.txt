    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.TeeWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 20 lines of code (loc=20), which indicates a very small and focused class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 2 methods and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class appears to be well-decomposed and focused on its single responsibility. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=2) further support that this is a well-modularized small class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
