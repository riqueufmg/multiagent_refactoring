    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.TaggedInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 42 lines of code (loc=42), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 0.5 lack of cohesion (lcom=0.5), the class shows moderate cohesion. The class has no fan-in or fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a simple inheritance depth (dit=1), indicating it's not overly coupled or complex. These metrics suggest the class is sufficiently modularized."
