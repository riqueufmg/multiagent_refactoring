    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), and 40 lines of code. The lack of methods (nopm=0, nom=0) and minimal field count indicate it is already well-decomposed. No significant complexity or size issues are present that would warrant further decomposition."
