{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.AbstractInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5), 40 lines of code (loc=40), and weighted method count of 5 (wmc=5). The lack of fields (nof=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for an abstract input stream implementation."
