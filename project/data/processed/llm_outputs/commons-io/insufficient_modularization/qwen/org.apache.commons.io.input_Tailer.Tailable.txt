    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer.Tailable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 32 lines of code which is relatively small, and all metrics (nof=0, nopf=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0) indicate minimal complexity. The negative LCOM value suggests good cohesion, and zero dependencies indicate no external coupling. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its minimal size and complexity."
