    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOSpliterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods with WMC of 12, indicating moderate complexity. LOC is 90 which is relatively small. The class has 0 public methods, suggesting it's likely a utility or internal class with focused responsibilities. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies indicate limited coupling. While it has dependencies on 3 other classes, this is typical for specialized functionality classes. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
