    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.RandomAccessFileOutputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (loc=25, wmc=0, nof=0, nom=0) and no dependencies, indicating it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low lines of code and absence of methods or fields suggest this is likely a simple builder class that is appropriately modularized."
