    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CharSequenceInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 32 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 18 with 14 public methods suggesting high interface complexity, LOC (Lines of Code) is 237 indicating substantial implementation size, and it has 7 fields with 0 public fields suggesting potential internal state complexity. The class also has dependencies on 4 other classes including a nested Builder class, indicating complex internal structure that could benefit from further decomposition."
