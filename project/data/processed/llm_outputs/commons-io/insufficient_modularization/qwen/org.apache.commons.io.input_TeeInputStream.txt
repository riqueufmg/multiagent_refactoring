    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.TeeInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 6 public), low complexity (WMC=10), and reasonable size (88 LOC). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the lack of dependencies suggests clear separation of concerns. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
