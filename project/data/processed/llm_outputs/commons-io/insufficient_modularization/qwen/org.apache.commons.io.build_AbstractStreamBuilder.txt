{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractStreamBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 26 methods (nom), 22 public methods (nopm), 288 lines of code (loc), and WMC of 26. The high number of methods and lines of code suggests the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. LCOM value of 0.269 indicates some cohesion issues, and the class has 10 fields which further supports the need for modularization."
