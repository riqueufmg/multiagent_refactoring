    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ClosedReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 fields (nof=2), and low lines of code (loc=38). The weighted method count (wmc=4) and lack of cohesion metric (lcom=1.0) indicate good internal cohesion. With only 2 public methods and 3 total methods, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
