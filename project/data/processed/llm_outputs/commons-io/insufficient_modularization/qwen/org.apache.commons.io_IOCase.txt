{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOCase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) with 12 public methods (nopm=12), 3 fields (nof=3), and 165 lines of code (loc=165). The weighted method count (wmc=19) indicates moderate complexity. The low LCOM value (0.1428571428571428) suggests good cohesion among methods. The class appears to be a well-encapsulated utility class with focused responsibility for case-sensitive/insensitive string operations. The size and complexity are appropriate for its functionality, and there's no indication that further decomposition would provide significant benefits."
