    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 20 lines of code (loc=20), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The absence of methods and low code complexity indicates this class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
