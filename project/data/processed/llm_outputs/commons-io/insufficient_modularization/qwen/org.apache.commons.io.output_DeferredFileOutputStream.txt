{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.DeferredFileOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods with WMC of 25, which indicates moderate complexity. LCOM value of 0.1578947368421052 suggests good cohesion. The class size of 322 LOC is reasonable for its functionality. While it has dependencies on 4 other classes, this reflects appropriate modularization rather than insufficient decomposition. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
