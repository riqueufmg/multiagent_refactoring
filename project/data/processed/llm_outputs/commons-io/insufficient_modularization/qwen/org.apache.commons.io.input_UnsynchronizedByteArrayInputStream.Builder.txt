    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedByteArrayInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and 0 lines of code (loc=56 but this appears to be the enclosing file). With no methods or complexity present, there is no insufficient modularization issue as the class is already minimally implemented."
