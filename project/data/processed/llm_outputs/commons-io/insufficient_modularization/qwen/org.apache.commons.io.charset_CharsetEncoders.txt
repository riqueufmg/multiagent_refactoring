    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 2 public methods (nopm=2), with low complexity (wmc=3) and small size (loc=29). The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates a well-focused, simple utility class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
