    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ProxyWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) with 11 public methods (nopm=11), 194 lines of code (loc=194), and a weighted method count of 14 (wmc=14). While the class has moderate size and complexity, there is no clear indication of insufficient modularization as the metrics do not suggest excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be reasonably well-structured with manageable complexity."
