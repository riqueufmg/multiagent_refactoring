    "justification": "The class has 11 methods with a WMC of 15, indicating moderate complexity. With only 2 fields and 111 lines of code, the class is relatively small and focused. The LCOM value of 0.2727272727272727 suggests good cohesion within the class. Given these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains reasonable size and complexity levels."
