    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 1 field (nof=1), with low complexity (wmc=4, loc=23). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization. No evidence of incomplete decomposition or excessive size/complexity that would warrant further breakdown."
