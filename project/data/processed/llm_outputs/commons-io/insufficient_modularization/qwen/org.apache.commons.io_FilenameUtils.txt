{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 48 methods (nom), 167 weighted method count (wmc), 928 lines of code (loc), and only 16 fields (nof) with 2 public fields (nopf). The high method-to-field ratio and substantial LOC suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
