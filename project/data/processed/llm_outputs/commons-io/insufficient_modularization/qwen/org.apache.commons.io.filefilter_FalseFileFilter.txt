    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.FalseFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 8 methods (nom=8), low weighted method count (wmc=8), and reasonable lines of code (loc=62). The lack of fanin and fanout suggests it's not heavily interconnected, and the single responsibility is clear from its name and purpose. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
