    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.ConditionalFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 31 lines of code (loc=31), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no fields (nof=0), the class does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its size and complexity."
