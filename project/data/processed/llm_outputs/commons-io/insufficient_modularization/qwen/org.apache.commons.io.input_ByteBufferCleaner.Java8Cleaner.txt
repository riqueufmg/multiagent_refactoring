    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 14 lines of code (loc=14), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. There are no methods to decompose and the size is already minimal."
