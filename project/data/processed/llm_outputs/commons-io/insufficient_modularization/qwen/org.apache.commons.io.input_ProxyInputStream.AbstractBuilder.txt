    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ProxyInputStream.AbstractBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 30 lines of code (loc). It has minimal fields (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple builder with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
