{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.channels.CloseShieldChannelHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods and WMC of 19, but LCOM of 0.333 suggests good cohesion. With only 99 lines of code and 3 fields, the class is relatively small and manageable. The low number of methods (6) and fields (3) indicates it's already well-decomposed for its functionality. No external dependencies further suggest focused responsibility."
