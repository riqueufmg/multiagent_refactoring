    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileAlterationListenerAdaptor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9, nopm=9) and 60 lines of code (loc=60), which represents a relatively small and focused class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 9, indicating low complexity. With DIT=1, it's a base class with no inheritance hierarchy. The class appears to be a simple adapter implementation with a single responsibility, and there's no evidence of insufficient modularization based on its size and complexity metrics."
