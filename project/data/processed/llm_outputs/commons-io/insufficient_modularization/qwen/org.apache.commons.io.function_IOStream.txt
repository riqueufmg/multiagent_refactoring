{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 42 methods (nom=42) and 394 lines of code (loc=394), indicating high size and complexity. The high number of dependencies (13 external classes) suggests multiple responsibilities. The class directly manages various IO functional interfaces (IOPredicate, IOConsumer, IOBiConsumer, etc.) and core IO operations, indicating it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
