    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ClassNameMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 11 lines of code (loc=11), and no fields (nof=0). The low number of methods and lines of code indicates minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its small size and simple structure."
