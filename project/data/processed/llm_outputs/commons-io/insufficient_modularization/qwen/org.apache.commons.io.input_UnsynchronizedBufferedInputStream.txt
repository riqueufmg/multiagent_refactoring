{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedBufferedInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 11 methods with 8 private methods, WMC of 46 indicating high method complexity, and 284 lines of code. The LCOM value of 0.1818181818181818 suggests some cohesion issues. With 5 fields and multiple private methods handling different responsibilities (buffer management, stream operations, builder pattern), the class could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
