    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 14 lines of code and 0 methods, fields, or dependencies. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. With no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), there is insufficient functionality to exhibit insufficient modularization."
