    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.buffer.CircularBufferInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods and WMC of 17, but LCOM of 0.286 indicates good cohesion. With only 98 lines of code and 3 fields, the class size is reasonable. The class has 5 public methods which is acceptable for its functionality as an input stream buffer. No clear indication of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
