    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.BrokenWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) and 76 lines of code (loc=76), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=8) is low, indicating low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and 1 public field (nopf=1), the class is not data-heavy. The LCOM value of 0.5 suggests reasonable cohesion. The class has no fan-in or fan-out dependencies, indicating it's relatively isolated. While there might be room for some decomposition, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant classification as Insufficient Modularization."
