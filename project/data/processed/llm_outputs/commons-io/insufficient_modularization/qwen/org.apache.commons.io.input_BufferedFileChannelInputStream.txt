    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BufferedFileChannelInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15) with a weighted method count of 27 (wmc=27), indicating high complexity. The lines of code count is 191 (loc=191) which is substantial for a single class. The class has 3 fields (nof=3) and 15 methods, suggesting it may be handling multiple responsibilities. With 10 public methods (nopm=10) and only 5 non-public methods, the class exposes a complex interface. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's a standalone complex class that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
