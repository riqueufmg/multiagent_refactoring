{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.CanWriteFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 38 lines of code (loc=38), and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=0) and simple method count (nopm=2) indicate minimal implementation complexity. The class appears to be sufficiently decomposed for its functionality as a file filter, with no evidence of incomplete decomposition or excessive size that would warrant further modularization."
