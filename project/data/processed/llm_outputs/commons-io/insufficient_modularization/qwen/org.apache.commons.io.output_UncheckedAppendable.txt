    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.UncheckedAppendable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 29 lines of code (loc=29), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) matches the number of methods, suggesting each method has a cyclomatic complexity of 1. With no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies, this class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
