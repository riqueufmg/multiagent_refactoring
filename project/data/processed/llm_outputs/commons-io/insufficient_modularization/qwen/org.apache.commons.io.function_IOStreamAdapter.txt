{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStreamAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 15 lines of code (loc=15), which indicates a small and focused implementation. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 public method (nopm=1) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class appears to have a single responsibility and is adequately modularized for its size and complexity."
