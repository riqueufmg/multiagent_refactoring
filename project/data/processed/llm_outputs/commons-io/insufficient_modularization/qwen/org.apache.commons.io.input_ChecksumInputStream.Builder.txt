    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ChecksumInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a low LOC count of 62. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration object rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
