    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BoundedInputStream.AbstractBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with 68 lines of code (loc=68). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed. The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0), suggesting minimal complexity. While the class has some lines of code, the low method count suggests it's likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
