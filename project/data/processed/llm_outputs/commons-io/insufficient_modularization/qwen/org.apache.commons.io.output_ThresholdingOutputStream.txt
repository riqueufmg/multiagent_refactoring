    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ThresholdingOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 16 methods and WMC of 17, but lacks sufficient metrics indicating insufficient modularization. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and with only 176 lines of code, the class size is manageable. No clear evidence of incomplete decomposition based on the provided metrics."
