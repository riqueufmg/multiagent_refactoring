{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.StringBuilderWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) with all being public (nopm=12), indicating a well-defined public interface. The lines of code (loc=106) and weighted method count (wmc=14) are relatively low, suggesting manageable complexity. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.25) indicate the class is focused and self-contained. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains good encapsulation. These metrics suggest appropriate modularization for a small utility class."
