{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ClosedInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 2 fields (nof=2), and low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lines of code (loc=52) are minimal, indicating proper modularization. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (lcom=1.0) suggest the class is well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
