    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.CountingPathVisitor.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) indicating minimal implementation complexity. Since this is a Builder class with no methods or fields, it represents a minimal decomposition and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
