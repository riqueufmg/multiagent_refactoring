{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.TeeOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6, wmc=6), 67 lines of code (loc=67), no fields (nof=1), and no class dependencies (nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be properly modularized with a focused responsibility of writing to multiple output streams simultaneously."
