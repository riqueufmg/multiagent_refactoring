{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.AbstractByteArrayOutputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 24 methods (nom), 40 weighted method count (wmc), 322 lines of code (loc), and 7 fields (nof). The high method count and weighted method complexity suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused components. The class also has multiple dependencies (4 external dependencies) which further indicates it may be doing too much and could be better modularized."
