{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ProxyOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods with 10 public methods, 188 lines of code, and WMC of 18 which indicates moderate complexity. While the class has some complexity, it does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to have a coherent responsibility as a proxy output stream. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would necessitate further decomposition."
