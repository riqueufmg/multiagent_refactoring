    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 74 lines of code (loc). It has minimal responsibilities with 1 field (nof) and no public fields (nopf). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
