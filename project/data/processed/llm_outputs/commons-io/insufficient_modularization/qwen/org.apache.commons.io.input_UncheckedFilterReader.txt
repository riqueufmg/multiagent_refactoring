    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedFilterReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 102 lines of code (loc=102), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=11) is low, suggesting low complexity. The lack of fields (nof=0) and package dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates minimal internal state and external coupling. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, its small size and low complexity do not constitute insufficient modularization."
