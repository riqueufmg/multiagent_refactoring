    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (128 LOC, 16 methods) and complexity (WMC=16) for its functionality. The low LCOM value (0.1875) indicates good cohesion among methods. The class appears to be properly focused on its filtering responsibility with appropriate inheritance from AbstractFileFilter and implementation of IOFileFilter interface."
