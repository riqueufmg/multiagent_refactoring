    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 159 methods (nom=159) with 2371 lines of code (loc=2371), indicating excessive size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=244) further confirms high implementation complexity. The large number of private methods (nopm=135) and private fields (nopf=17) suggest internal complexity that could be reduced through decomposition into smaller, more manageable classes. The class contains significant functionality that could be modularized into separate cohesive units."
