    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.NullPrintStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 23 lines of code, and no class-level dependencies (nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of methods and minimal complexity indicate sufficient modularization for this simple class that appears to be a basic null object implementation."
