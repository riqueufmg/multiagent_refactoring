    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStreams",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) and 42 lines of code (loc=42), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=8) matches the number of methods, suggesting simple method complexity. The lack of direct dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low coupling metrics (lcom=0.75) indicate the class is not overly complex. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, its current size and complexity metrics do not clearly indicate insufficient modularization as it remains reasonably small and focused."
