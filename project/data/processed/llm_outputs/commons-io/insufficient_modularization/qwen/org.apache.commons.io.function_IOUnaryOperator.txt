    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOUnaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0), low complexity (wmc=2), and minimal size (loc=24). With such few methods and low complexity, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately decomposed for its current functionality."
