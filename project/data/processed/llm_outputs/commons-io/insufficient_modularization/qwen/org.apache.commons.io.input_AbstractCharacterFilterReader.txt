    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.AbstractCharacterFilterReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5 total, 2 public), low complexity (WMC=10), and reasonable size (61 LOC). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the low number of fields (2) suggests proper encapsulation. There are no external dependencies, indicating clear separation of concerns. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
