    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOrigin.URIOrigin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 37 lines of code (loc=37), and WMC=0 indicating very low complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or value object with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest it is already sufficiently modularized for its intended purpose."
