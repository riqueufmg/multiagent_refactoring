```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BoundedInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 25 methods (nom=25) with 19 public methods (nopm=19), high Weighted Method Count (wmc=29), and 327 lines of code (loc=327). The high number of methods and lines of code indicate the class is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition. The presence of a Builder dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.BoundedInputStream.Builder) suggests some builder pattern implementation that could be further separated. The class also extends ProxyInputStream and uses IOBiConsumer, indicating multiple responsibilities that could be better modularized."
