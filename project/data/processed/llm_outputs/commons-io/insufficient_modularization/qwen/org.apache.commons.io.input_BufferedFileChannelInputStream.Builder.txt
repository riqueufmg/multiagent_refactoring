    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 36 lines of code (loc=36). With no methods implemented and minimal size, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already at a minimal decomposition state."
