{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ObservableInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 20 methods (nom), 266 lines of code (loc), and WMC of 26, indicating it handles too many responsibilities. It also contains nested classes (AbstractBuilder, Observer) suggesting it could be further decomposed. The class has low fanin (0) and fanout (0) but high internal complexity metrics suggest insufficient modularization."
