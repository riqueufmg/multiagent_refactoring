    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.MemoryMappedFileInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 6 fields (nof=6), with a WMC of 20 indicating moderate complexity. The LCOM value of 0.2 suggests good cohesion within the class. With 135 lines of code, the class is of moderate size. The class directly inherits from Object (DIT=1) and has low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). While there is some complexity, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be reasonably well-structured and decomposed for its functionality."
