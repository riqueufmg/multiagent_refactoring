    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.DirectoryStreamFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with all being public (nopm=3), 1 field (nof=1), and 24 lines of code (loc=24). The weighted method count (wmc=3) indicates low complexity. With such a small size and low complexity, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
