    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.TailerListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 29 lines of code (loc=29), which is relatively small. It has no fields (nof=0) and no public methods (nopm=0), suggesting it's a simple interface or abstract class. The low WMC (5) indicates low complexity. There are no signs of excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
