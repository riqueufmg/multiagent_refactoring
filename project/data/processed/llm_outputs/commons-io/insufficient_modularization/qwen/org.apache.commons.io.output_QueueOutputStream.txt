    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.QueueOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4), 43 lines of code (loc=43), and 1 field (nof=1). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized with a focused responsibility of managing queue-based output operations."
