    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.CloseShieldWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 29 lines of code (loc=29), which indicates a small and focused class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=3), suggesting low complexity. The class has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating minimal complexity and tight focus. The Depth of Inheritance Tree is shallow (dit=1) and there are no children classes (nc=0). While LCOM is -1.0 (which may indicate some cohesion issues), the overall size and complexity metrics suggest this class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
