{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.DeletingPathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods with WMC of 19, which indicates moderate complexity. The LCOM value of 0.36 suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 114 lines of code and 3 fields, the class is relatively small and manageable. The depth of inheritance tree (DIT) is 3, which is moderate. The class appears to be well-focused on its responsibility of visiting paths for deletion, and the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
