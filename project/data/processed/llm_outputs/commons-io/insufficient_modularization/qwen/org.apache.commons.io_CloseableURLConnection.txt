```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.CloseableURLConnection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 48 methods (nom=48) with 45 of them being public (nopm=45), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The class has 151 lines of code (loc=151) which is relatively large. The high method count and lines of code suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The low LCOM value (0.0625) indicates high cohesion but the sheer number of methods suggests insufficient modularization."
