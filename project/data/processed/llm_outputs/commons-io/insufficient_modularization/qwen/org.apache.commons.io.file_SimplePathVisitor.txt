    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.SimplePathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 2 fields (nof=2), and a low weighted method count (wmc=4). The lines of code (loc=56) are minimal, and the lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low coupling (lcom=0.0) indicate proper modularization. The small size and low complexity metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization."
