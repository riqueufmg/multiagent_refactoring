{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.serialization.RegexpClassNameMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 1 field (nof=1), and a small size of 24 lines of code (loc=24). The weighted method count (wmc=3) indicates low behavioral complexity. With only 3 methods and 1 field, there is insufficient evidence of incomplete decomposition or excessive size that would warrant further modularization. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its simple responsibility."
