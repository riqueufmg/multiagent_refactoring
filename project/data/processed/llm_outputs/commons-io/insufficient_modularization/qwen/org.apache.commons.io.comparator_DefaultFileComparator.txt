    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=2, NOM=2, LOC=29) and no dependencies, indicating it is already well-decomposed. The class implements a single responsibility with minimal methods and low cyclomatic complexity, suggesting sufficient modularization has been achieved."
