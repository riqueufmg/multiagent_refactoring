    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.HexDump",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a manageable size with 120 lines of code and 6 methods (3 public). The Weighted Method Count (WMC) of 16 indicates moderate complexity. With only 3 fields and low LCOM value of 0.5, the class appears to have reasonable cohesion. The limited number of methods and fields suggests adequate modularization for its functionality."
