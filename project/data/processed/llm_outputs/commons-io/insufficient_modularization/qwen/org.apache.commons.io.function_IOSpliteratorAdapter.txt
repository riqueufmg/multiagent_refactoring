{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOSpliteratorAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with low complexity (wmc=3), contains only 16 lines of code (loc=16), has a simple structure with no class dependencies (dit=1, fanin=0, fanout=0), and shows good cohesion (lcom=0.0). These metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
