{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedBufferedReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 56 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 327 indicating a large class size, and NOM (Number of Methods) is 15 which suggests the class is doing too much. The high WMC value particularly indicates that the class has complex method implementations that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
