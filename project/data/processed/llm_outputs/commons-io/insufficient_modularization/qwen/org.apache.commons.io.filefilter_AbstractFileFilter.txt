{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.AbstractFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 17 methods and WMC of 21, but LCOM value of 0.82 indicates good cohesion. The class serves as an abstract base class with 2 fields and provides foundational functionality for file filtering. The size (118 LOC) and method count are within reasonable limits for an abstract class providing common behavior, and there's no indication of mixed responsibilities or excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
