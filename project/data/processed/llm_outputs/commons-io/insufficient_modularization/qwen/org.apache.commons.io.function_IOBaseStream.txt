    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBaseStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 92 lines of code (loc=92), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 11, indicating moderate complexity. The class has 4 nested classes (nc=4) which suggests some level of decomposition has already occurred. There are no fields (nof=0) and no public fields (nopf=0), indicating proper encapsulation. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests this class may be relatively isolated, but doesn't indicate insufficient modularization. The metrics do not suggest the class is overly large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition."
