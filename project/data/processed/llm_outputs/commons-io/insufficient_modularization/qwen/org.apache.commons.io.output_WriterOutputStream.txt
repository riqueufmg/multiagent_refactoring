{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.WriterOutputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 17 methods (nom), 26 weighted method count (wmc), and 278 lines of code (loc). It also has multiple responsibilities including handling writer output stream operations, buffering, encoding, and managing various I/O utilities. The high method count and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition could reduce its size and implementation complexity."
