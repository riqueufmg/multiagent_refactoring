{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.TeeReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods (nom=7) with all being public (nopm=7), indicating a well-defined public interface. The lines of code (loc=109) and weighted method count (wmc=12) are within reasonable limits for a single class. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1) suggest this is a standalone utility class with focused responsibilities. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion among methods."
