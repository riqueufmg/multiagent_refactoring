    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOTriFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2) and 31 lines of code (loc=31), which indicates a very small and simple class. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and low complexity suggest it is already well modularized. No signs of insufficient modularization as the class is minimal and focused."
