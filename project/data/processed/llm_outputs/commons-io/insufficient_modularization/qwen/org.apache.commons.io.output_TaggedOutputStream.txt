{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.TaggedOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4), 42 lines of code (loc=42), and 1 field (nof=1). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates reasonable cohesion. With only 4 methods and minimal complexity, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
