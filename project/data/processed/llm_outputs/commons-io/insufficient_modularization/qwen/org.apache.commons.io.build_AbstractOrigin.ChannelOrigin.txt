{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOrigin.ChannelOrigin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely an empty or minimal class that doesn't require further decomposition. The low LOC count (41) is primarily due to being an inner class with minimal implementation. Since the class has no complexity (wmc=0) and no dependencies, it does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already at a minimal structural level."
