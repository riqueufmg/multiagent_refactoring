{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BOMInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 20 methods (nom), 33 weighted method count (wmc), and 307 lines of code (loc). The high number of methods and lines of code suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The class also contains nested dependencies including a Builder pattern implementation, which further indicates potential for better modularization."
