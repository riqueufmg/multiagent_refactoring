{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileSystem",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 29 methods (nom=29) and 433 lines of code (loc=433), indicating high size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=41) further confirms high implementation complexity. The class contains 17 fields (nof=17) and 17 public methods (nopm=17), suggesting it has multiple responsibilities. The low LCOM value (0.172) indicates some cohesion but given the high number of methods and fields, the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity. The dependencies on FilenameUtils and its inner class NameLengthStrategy suggest potential areas for better modularization."
