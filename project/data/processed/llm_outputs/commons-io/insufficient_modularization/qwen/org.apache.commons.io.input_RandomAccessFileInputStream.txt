{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.RandomAccessFileInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) with 13 public methods (nopm=13), 155 lines of code (loc=155), and a weighted method count of 18 (wmc=18). While the class has a moderate number of methods and lines of code, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The low LCOM value (0.214) suggests good cohesion, and the single level of inheritance (dit=1) indicates it's not part of a complex hierarchy. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
