{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.NullAppendable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 33 lines of code (loc=33), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 4 methods, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low LCOM value (1.0) indicates good cohesion among the class members."
