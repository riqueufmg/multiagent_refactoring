    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ProxyCollectionWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15) with 12 public methods (nopm=12), but the LOC is 202 which is relatively compact. The WMC equals the number of methods (wmc=15), indicating each method has cyclomatic complexity of 1. The class has no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies, suggesting it's already well-decomposed. While the method count is moderately high, the low complexity and compact size do not indicate insufficient modularization."
