{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 172 methods (nom=172) with 161 public methods (nopm=161), indicating excessive functionality concentrated in a single class. The high WMC value of 275 suggests high complexity. With 18 fields (nof=18) and 12 public fields (nopf=12), the class manages significant state. The LOC count of 2487 further confirms its large size. Such a high number of methods and fields in one class indicates insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes, which is characteristic of Insufficient Modularization."
