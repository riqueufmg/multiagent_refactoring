    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedFilterInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 88 lines of code (loc=88), resulting in a reasonable size and complexity. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=9) aligns with the method count, indicating straightforward method implementations. With 0 fields (nof=0) and no class dependencies (dit=0, nc=0), this appears to be a simple, well-contained class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
