{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.FilterCollectionWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) with 10 private methods (nopm=10), indicating reasonable decomposition. The lines of code (loc=87) and weighted method count (wmc=14) are within acceptable ranges for a single class. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0) suggests good internal cohesion, and the single field (nof=2) with no public fields (nopf=0) indicates proper encapsulation. The class appears to be well-modularized with appropriate method decomposition."
