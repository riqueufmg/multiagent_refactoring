{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.QueueInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods (nom) and 13 weighted method count (wmc), 152 lines of code (loc) which is reasonable for a single class. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.222) suggests good internal cohesion. The class has minimal external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only 4 fields (nof) with no public fields (nopf=0), indicating proper encapsulation. The method count and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately sized and cohesive."
