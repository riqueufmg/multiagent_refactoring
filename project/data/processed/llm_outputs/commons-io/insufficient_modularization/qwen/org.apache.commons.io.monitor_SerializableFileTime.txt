    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor.SerializableFileTime",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 54 lines of code (loc=54), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=13) is also low, suggesting low complexity. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and no class dependencies (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
