    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.MessageDigestInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), and low lines of code (loc=48). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal functional complexity. The lack of methods and low structural complexity suggests this is already a well-decomposed, simple class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
