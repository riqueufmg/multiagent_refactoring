    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal lines of code (loc=35), and no dependencies. The low method count and complexity metrics indicate it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
