{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.EndianUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 32 methods (nom=32) with 30 public methods (nopm=30), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=35) suggests high complexity. With 355 lines of code (loc=355), the class is large and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
