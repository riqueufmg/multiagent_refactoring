{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.LockableFileWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 22 methods (nom=22) with 18 public methods (nopm=18), indicating high functional complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=28) suggests significant implementation complexity. With 327 lines of code (loc=327), the class is large enough to warrant decomposition. The low LCOM value (0.2727272727272727) indicates some cohesion issues. The class has 5 fields (nof=5) and manages file locking functionality, stream operations, and builder patterns, which represent distinct responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
