{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOrigin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods with 14 public methods, 614 lines of code, and WMC of 21 which indicates moderate complexity. While the class has multiple responsibilities (handling file operations, charset management, and random access), the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would clearly warrant further decomposition. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class."
