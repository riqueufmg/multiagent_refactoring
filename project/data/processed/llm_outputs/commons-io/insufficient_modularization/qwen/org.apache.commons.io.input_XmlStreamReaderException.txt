{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReaderException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 7 methods (NOM), 89 lines of code (LOC), and a low weighted method count (WMC) of 7. The lack of fields (NOF=6, NOPF=0) and low lack of cohesion (LCOM=0.2857) indicate proper internal structure. With no dependencies and single nesting level (NC=1), the class is already well-modularized and does not require further decomposition."
