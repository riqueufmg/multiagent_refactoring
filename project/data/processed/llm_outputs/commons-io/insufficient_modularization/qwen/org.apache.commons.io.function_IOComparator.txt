{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2) and 25 lines of code (loc=25), which indicates a very small and simple class. With no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies except for Uncheck, the class appears to be well-modularized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low complexity metrics suggest the class is appropriately decomposed."
