{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.UncheckedFilterWriter.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 22 lines of code (loc=22). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods or fields to decompose further, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly simplified."
