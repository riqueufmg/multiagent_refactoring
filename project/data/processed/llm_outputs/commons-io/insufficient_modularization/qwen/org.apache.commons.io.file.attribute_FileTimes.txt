{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.attribute.FileTimes",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom=24) with 19 being public methods (nopm=19), indicating high complexity and potential violation of single responsibility principle. The large number of methods suggests the class may be doing too much and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) of 26 further confirms high complexity, and the LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) of 0.708 suggests poor internal cohesion, supporting the presence of Insufficient Modularization."
