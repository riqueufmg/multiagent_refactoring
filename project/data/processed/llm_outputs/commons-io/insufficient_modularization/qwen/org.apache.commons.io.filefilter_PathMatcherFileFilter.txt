    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.PathMatcherFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 20 lines of code (loc=20), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class-level dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
