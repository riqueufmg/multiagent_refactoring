{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.WildcardFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 15 methods (nom) and 189 lines of code (loc), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) is 15, indicating manageable complexity. The Lack of Cohesion in Methods (lcom) is 0.4, suggesting good cohesion within the class. The class has 5 fields (nof) and 3 levels of inheritance (dit), which are acceptable values. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the current level of modularization appears sufficient given the moderate size and complexity metrics."
