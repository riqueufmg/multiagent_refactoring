    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.TailerListenerAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 7 methods (nom=7, wmc=7), 45 lines of code (loc=45), and serves as an adapter implementation with a single responsibility. The low method count and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization for its intended purpose as a listener adapter."
