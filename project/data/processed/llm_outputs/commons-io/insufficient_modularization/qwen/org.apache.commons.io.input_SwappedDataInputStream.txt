    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.SwappedDataInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods with a WMC of 18, which indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. The LOC is 159 which is reasonable for a class with this functionality. The class has only 2 dependencies and no inheritance (DIT=1), suggesting it's already well-decomposed. The LCOM value is -1.0 which may indicate good cohesion. Based on the metrics provided, this class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
