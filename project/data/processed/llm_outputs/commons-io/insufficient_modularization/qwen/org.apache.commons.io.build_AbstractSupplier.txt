    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (1 public) and 21 lines of code, indicating minimal complexity. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 2, which is very low. The class has no fields (NOF=0) and no dependencies, suggesting it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
