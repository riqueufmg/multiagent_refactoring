    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4) and 48 lines of code (loc=48), which indicates a small and manageable size. With no fields (nof=0) and no public methods (nopm=0), the class appears to be a simple functional interface or utility class with minimal complexity. The low method count and small size suggest adequate modularization for its current purpose."
