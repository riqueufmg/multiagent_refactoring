{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer.TailablePath",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), and 29 lines of code (loc=29). The low number of fields and methods, combined with the relatively small size (29 LOC), indicates that the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. There are no complex responsibilities or excessive size that would warrant further decomposition."
