```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ChunkedOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods (nom=6) with 4 public methods (nopm=4), 102 lines of code (loc=102), and a weighted method count of 9 (wmc=9). These metrics indicate a relatively small and focused class. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest proper modularization. The class appears to have a single responsibility focused on chunked output stream functionality."
