{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ProxyReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) with 11 public methods (nopm=11), 184 lines of code (loc=184), and a weighted method count of 14 (wmc=14). While the class has moderate size and complexity, it does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains a reasonable method count and complexity level. The low number of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and manageable cyclomatic complexity (wmc=14) suggest adequate modularization for its functionality."
