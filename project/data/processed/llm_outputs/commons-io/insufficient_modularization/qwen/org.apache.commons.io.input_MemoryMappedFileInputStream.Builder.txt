    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 27 lines of code (loc=27). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Since the class is already minimally complex and well-decomposed, it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
