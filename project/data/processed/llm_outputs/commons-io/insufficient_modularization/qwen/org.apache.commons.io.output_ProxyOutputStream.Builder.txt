    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ProxyOutputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 23 lines of code (loc=23). The depth of inheritance tree is 4 (dit=4) and it has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). This indicates a minimal, focused class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple builder pattern implementation with low complexity that does not require further decomposition."
