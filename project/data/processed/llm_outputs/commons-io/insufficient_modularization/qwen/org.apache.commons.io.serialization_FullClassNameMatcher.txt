    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=1) and 16 lines of code (loc=16), with a low weighted method count (wmc=2). The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=1, lcom=0.0) indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
