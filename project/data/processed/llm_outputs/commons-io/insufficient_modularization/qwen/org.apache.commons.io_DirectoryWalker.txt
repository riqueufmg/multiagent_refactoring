```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.DirectoryWalker",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 16 methods (nom), 23 weighted method count (wmc), and 261 lines of code (loc). With only 5 fields (nof) and low cohesion (lcom=0.125), the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The presence of nested CancelException and multiple file filter dependencies suggests potential for better modularization."
