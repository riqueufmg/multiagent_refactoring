    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedBufferedInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 24 lines of code (loc=24). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With no methods or fields to decompose further, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
