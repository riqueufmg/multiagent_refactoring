{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedFilterInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (134 LOC, 12 methods) and low complexity (WMC=12). The LCOM value of 0.167 indicates good cohesion, suggesting methods are well-related to each other. With only 1 field and 12 methods, the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The low fan-in and fan-out values indicate limited external dependencies, supporting modular design."
