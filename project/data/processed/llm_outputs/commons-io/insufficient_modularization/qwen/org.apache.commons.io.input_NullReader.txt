{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.NullReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (209 lines of code) and complexity (WMC=30) for its functionality. With 16 methods and 8 fields, the class maintains manageable cohesion (LCOM=0.125 indicating good method-to-field relationship). The number of methods and fields suggests appropriate encapsulation rather than insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a well-contained utility class with focused responsibility."
