{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileSystemUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7) with 6 public methods (nopm=6), 87 lines of code (loc=87), and weighted method count of 8 (wmc=8). These metrics indicate a relatively small and simple class that does not exhibit excessive size or complexity. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest the class is already well-decomposed and does not require further modularization."
