    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.ThreadMonitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 60 lines of code (loc=60), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=7) indicates low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class is already well-encapsulated. The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, nc=0) suggests it's already sufficiently modularized for its size and complexity."
