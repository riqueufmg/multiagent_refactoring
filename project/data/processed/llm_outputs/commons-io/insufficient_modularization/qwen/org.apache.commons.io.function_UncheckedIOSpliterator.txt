    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.UncheckedIOSpliterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) and 34 lines of code (loc=34), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=9) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains good encapsulation. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, nc=0) indicate this class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
