```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.FileFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 3 fields (nof=3), and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lines of code (loc=41) are minimal, and the lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates simplicity. The depth of inheritance (dit=3) and lack of children (nc=0) suggest it's a leaf class that doesn't require further decomposition. The low LCOM value (1.0) indicates good cohesion among class members."
