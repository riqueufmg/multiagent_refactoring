    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 33 lines of code (loc=33), which indicates a very small and focused class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 2 (wmc=2), showing minimal complexity. With such low complexity and size, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization - it appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
