```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ObservableInputStream.Observer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 46 lines of code (loc=46). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While the class is nested (Observer within ObservableInputStream), its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization. The negative LCOM value (-1.0) suggests incomplete metric calculation rather than a cohesion issue. There are no dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships to analyze."
