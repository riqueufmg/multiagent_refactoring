{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 124 lines of code (loc=124). It has a moderate number of fields (nof=9) but no public fields (nopf=0). The lack of methods and low complexity metrics indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
