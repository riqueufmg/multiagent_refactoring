    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ByteBufferCleaner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 70 lines of code (loc=70), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, indicating low complexity. With only 5 fields (nof=5) and a moderate lack of cohesion (lcom=0.667), the class does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
