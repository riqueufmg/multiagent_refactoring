    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ObservableInputStream.AbstractBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 20 lines of code (loc). It has minimal functionality with only 1 field (nof) and no public fields (nopf). The lack of methods and low complexity indicates it is already sufficiently decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization."
