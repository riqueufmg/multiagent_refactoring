{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.MessageDigestCalculatingInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods (nom), 138 lines of code (loc), and weighted method count (wmc) of 7. The lack of fields (nof=4, all private) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest reasonable modularization. The LCOM value of 0.57 indicates some cohesion issues but not severe enough to warrant further decomposition. The class size and complexity are within acceptable ranges for a single cohesive unit."
