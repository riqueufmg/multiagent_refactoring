    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BoundedReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (87 LOC) and complexity (WMC=10) for its functionality. With 6 methods and 6 fields, the class maintains a cohesive design. The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good method cohesion, and the absence of dependencies suggests it's a self-contained utility class. No clear indication that further decomposition would provide significant benefits."
