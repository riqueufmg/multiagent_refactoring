{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.ByteOrderMark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (178 LOC, 10 methods) and complexity (WMC=25) which is within reasonable limits for a well-focused class. The high number of private fields (9 NOF, 6 private fields) and methods (9 private methods out of 10) suggests proper encapsulation rather than insufficient modularization. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, meaning the methods and fields are well-related to each other. While the class has some complexity, it appears to be a cohesive unit responsible for Byte Order Mark representation and operations, without clear indications that further decomposition would be beneficial."
