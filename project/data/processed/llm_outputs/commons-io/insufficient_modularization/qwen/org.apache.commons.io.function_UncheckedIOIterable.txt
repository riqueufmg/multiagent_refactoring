    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.UncheckedIOIterable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with low complexity (wmc=2), small size (loc=17), and only 1 field (nof=1). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity metrics, indicates sufficient modularization. There is no evidence of incomplete decomposition or excessive size that would suggest insufficient modularization."
