{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.DirectoryFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 public methods (nopm=2), and a small size of 39 lines of code (loc=39). The weighted method count (wmc=3) indicates minimal method complexity. With only 5 fields (nof=5) and 2 public fields (nopf=2), the class maintains a simple structure. The LCOM value of 0.667 suggests reasonable cohesion, and the lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates clear separation of concerns. The class follows single responsibility principle adequately and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
