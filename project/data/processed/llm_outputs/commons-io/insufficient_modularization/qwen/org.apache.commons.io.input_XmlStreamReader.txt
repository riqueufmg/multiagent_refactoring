{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 25 methods (nom), 64 weighted methods (wmc), 541 lines of code (loc), and only 1 class coupling (nc). The high method count and weighted method complexity suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The low coupling indicates it's not heavily interconnected with other classes, making it a good candidate for refactoring through decomposition."
