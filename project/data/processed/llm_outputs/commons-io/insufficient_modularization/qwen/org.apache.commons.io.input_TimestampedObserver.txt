    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (55 LOC) and complexity (WMC=8, NOM=8). All methods are public (NOPM=8) indicating clear interface design. The low LCOM value (0.25) suggests good cohesion among class members. The class has minimal responsibilities with only 2 fields and no external dependencies, indicating proper modularization."
