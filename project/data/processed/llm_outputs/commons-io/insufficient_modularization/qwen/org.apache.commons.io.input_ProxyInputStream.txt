{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ProxyInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods with 12 public methods, 249 lines of code, and WMC of 21. While the class has moderate complexity, the metrics do not indicate severe insufficient modularization. The LCOM value of 0.3157894736842105 suggests reasonable cohesion, and the relatively balanced method-to-code ratio does not clearly indicate the need for further decomposition."
