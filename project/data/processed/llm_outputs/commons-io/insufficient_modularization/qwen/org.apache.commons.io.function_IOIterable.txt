{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIterable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 44 lines of code (loc=44), which indicates a small and manageable size. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class does not exhibit excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition. The low method count and simple structure suggest sufficient modularization has already been achieved."
