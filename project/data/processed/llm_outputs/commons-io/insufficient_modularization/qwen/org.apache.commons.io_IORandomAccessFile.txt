{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IORandomAccessFile",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 56 lines of code (loc=56), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to have a focused responsibility. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, nc=0) suggest it is already well-decomposed. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class."
