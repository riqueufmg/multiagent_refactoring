    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.WindowsLineEndingInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (81 LOC) and complexity (WMC=13) with 5 methods, which is within acceptable limits for a specialized input stream class. The LCOM value of 0.4 indicates reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be a focused implementation of a specific functionality (Windows line ending handling) and does not show clear signs of needing further decomposition."
