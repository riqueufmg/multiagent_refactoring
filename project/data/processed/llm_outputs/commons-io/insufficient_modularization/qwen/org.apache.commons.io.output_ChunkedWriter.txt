{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ChunkedWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with all being public (nopm=3), low complexity (wmc=5), and relatively small size (loc=54). The LCOM value of 0.667 indicates some cohesion issues but given the small number of methods and low complexity, further decomposition would not provide significant benefits. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
