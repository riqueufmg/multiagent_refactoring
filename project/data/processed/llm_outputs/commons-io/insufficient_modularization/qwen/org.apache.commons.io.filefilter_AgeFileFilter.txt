{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.AgeFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods with a WMC of 11, indicating each method has an average cyclomatic complexity of 1. The LCOM value of 0.36 suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 110 LOC and 3 fields, the class is relatively small and focused on a single responsibility of filtering files by age. The low complexity and manageable size do not indicate insufficient modularization."
