    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.StandardDeleteOption",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=19), and minimal complexity metrics (wmc=2). The class appears to be a simple enumeration or constant class with no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies. Such a small and simple class does not warrant further decomposition as it would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
