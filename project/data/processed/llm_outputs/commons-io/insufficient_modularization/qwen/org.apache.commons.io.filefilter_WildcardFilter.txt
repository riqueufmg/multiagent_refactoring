    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (76 LOC) and complexity (WMC=9) with only 6 methods. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and DIT=3 suggests appropriate inheritance depth. The low number of fields (NOF=2) and methods indicate it's already well-decomposed for its functionality."
