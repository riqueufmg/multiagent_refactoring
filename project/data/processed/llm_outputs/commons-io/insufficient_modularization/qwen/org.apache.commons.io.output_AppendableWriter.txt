{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.AppendableWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 104 lines of code (loc=104), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=11) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to have a focused responsibility. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.3) suggests methods are reasonably related. These metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
