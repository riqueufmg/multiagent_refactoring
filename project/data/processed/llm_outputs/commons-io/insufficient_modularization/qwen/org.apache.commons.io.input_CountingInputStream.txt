    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CountingInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (91 loc) and complexity (WMC=12, NOM=9). It follows single responsibility principle by focusing on counting functionality while delegating core stream operations to ProxyInputStream. The low LCOM value (0.44) indicates good cohesion among methods. The class is not overly complex and does not exhibit signs of needing further decomposition."
