    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.AutoCloseInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6), 3 public methods (nopm=3), and low weighted method count (wmc=7). The lines of code (loc=78) are reasonable for the functionality provided. The class has minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no fields (nof=0), indicating focused responsibility. The depth of inheritance (dit=1) shows it's not part of a complex hierarchy. While it could potentially be decomposed further, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant decomposition for reducing implementation complexity or size."
