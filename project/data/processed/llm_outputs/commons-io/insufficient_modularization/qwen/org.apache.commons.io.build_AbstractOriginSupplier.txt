    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOriginSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 33 methods (nom) and 283 lines of code (loc), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 34, indicating moderate complexity. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) is 0.0606, which is very low and indicates high cohesion among methods. The class has only 2 dependencies, suggesting reasonable coupling. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization as the complexity and size are within acceptable ranges."
