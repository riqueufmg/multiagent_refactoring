    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and very low complexity (wmc=1, loc=13). With such minimal functionality and low complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already appropriately decomposed for its simple responsibility."
