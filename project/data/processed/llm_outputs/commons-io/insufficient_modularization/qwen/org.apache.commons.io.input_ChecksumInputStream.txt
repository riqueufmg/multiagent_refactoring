{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ChecksumInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of fields (5), methods (5), and low weighted method count (6), indicating it is not overly complex. The lines of code (113) are reasonable for a class with its functionality. The low LCOM value (0.4) suggests good cohesion among class members. The class appears to be appropriately modularized with a focused responsibility."
