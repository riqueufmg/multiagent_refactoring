    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedFilterInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 21 lines of code (loc=21). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. With such minimal functionality and low size, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately simple and does not require further decomposition."
