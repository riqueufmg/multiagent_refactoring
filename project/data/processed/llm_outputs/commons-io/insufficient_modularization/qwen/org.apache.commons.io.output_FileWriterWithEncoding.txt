    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.FileWriterWithEncoding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) with 13 private methods (nopm=13), indicating a reasonable level of decomposition. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 19, which is moderate. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion in Methods) is 0.5, suggesting reasonable cohesion. The class has 242 lines of code (loc=242) which is acceptable for a class with this level of functionality. The dependency list shows only 3 dependencies, indicating controlled external relationships. The DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) is 1, showing no inheritance complexity. Overall, the metrics suggest adequate modularization without clear evidence of insufficient decomposition."
