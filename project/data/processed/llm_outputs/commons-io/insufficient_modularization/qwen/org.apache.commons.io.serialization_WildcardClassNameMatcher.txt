    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with low complexity (wmc=2), contains minimal code (loc=16), has no fields (nof=1), and shows good cohesion (lcom=0.0). The low number of methods and minimal lines of code indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity."
