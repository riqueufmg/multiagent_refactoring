    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.SizeFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=8, LOC=77, NOM=4) and a single responsibility focused on file size comparison. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and DIT=1 shows it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy. The number of fields (NOF=6) and methods (NOM=4) are reasonable for a comparator class, indicating sufficient modularization."
