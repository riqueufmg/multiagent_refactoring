    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CharacterSetFilterReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 29 lines of code (loc=29), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 public methods (nopm=2) and no fields (nof=0), the class appears to be well-focused and adequately modularized for its functionality."
