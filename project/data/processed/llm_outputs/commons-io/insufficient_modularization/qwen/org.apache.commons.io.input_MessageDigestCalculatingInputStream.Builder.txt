    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.MessageDigestCalculatingInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and 0 lines of code in methods (loc=48 includes class definition but no substantial method implementation). WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. The class appears to be a simple builder with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. Size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
