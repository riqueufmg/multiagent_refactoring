    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with WMC=0, NOM=0, and only 123 lines of code. It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field and no methods. The dependency on ObjectStreamClassPredicate suggests focused functionality. While LOC>100, the low complexity metrics and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization for its current scope."
