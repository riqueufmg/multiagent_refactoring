{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.MessageDigestInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 3 fields (nof=3), with a low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=3). The lines of code (loc=102) include comments and whitespace, and the actual implementation is relatively small. The LCOM value of 0.6666666666666666 indicates reasonable cohesion. The class does not exhibit signs of being overly large or complex that would warrant further decomposition."
