{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.OrFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (124 LOC, 15 methods) and low complexity (WMC=15, LCOM=0.2). The low LCOM value indicates good cohesion within the class, and the small number of fields (2) and methods suggest it is already well-decomposed. The class appears to have a single, focused responsibility implementing OR logic for file filtering."
