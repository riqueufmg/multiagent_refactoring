{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileCleaningTracker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 11 methods (nom) and 14 weighted method count (wmc), which is manageable. The lines of code (loc) at 204 is reasonable for a class with its responsibilities. The lack of fields (nof=7, nopf=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, nc=0) suggests good separation of concerns. The LCOM value of 0.36 indicates reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
