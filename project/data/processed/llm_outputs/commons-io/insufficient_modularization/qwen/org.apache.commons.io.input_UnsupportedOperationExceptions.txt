    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a small and simple class. With 1 field (nof=1) and no complex dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already well-decomposed and manageable in size and complexity."
