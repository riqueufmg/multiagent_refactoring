{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ByteArrayOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods with a WMC of 14, indicating moderate complexity. With only 81 lines of code and no fields, the class is relatively small and focused. The DIT of 1 shows it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy, and LCOM of -1.0 suggests good cohesion. The low method count and manageable size do not indicate insufficient modularization."
