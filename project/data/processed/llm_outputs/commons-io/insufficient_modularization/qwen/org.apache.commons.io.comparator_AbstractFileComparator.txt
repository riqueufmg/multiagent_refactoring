    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.AbstractFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 37 lines of code (loc=37), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies, this class appears to be well-modularized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
