    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IORunnable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 26 lines of code (loc=26), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=3) indicates low complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be a simple functional interface or utility class that is already well-decomposed. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and minimal dependencies (2 external classes) suggests this is a focused, single-responsibility component that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
