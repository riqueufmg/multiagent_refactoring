    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.RegexFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 105 lines of code (loc=105), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 10, indicating moderate complexity. The class has low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and good cohesion (lcom=0.0). The depth of inheritance tree (dit=3) is moderate. While the class could potentially be decomposed, its current size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it maintains good design principles with low coupling and high cohesion."
