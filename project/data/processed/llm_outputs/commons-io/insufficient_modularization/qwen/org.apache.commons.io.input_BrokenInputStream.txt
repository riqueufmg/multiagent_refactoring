```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BrokenInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 98 lines of code (loc=98), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=11) matches the number of methods, indicating simple method complexity. The low fanin (0) and fanout (0) suggest minimal external dependencies. While the class has some private methods (nopm=9 out of nom=11), the overall size and complexity are not excessive for a single class, and there's no clear indication that further decomposition would provide significant benefits."
