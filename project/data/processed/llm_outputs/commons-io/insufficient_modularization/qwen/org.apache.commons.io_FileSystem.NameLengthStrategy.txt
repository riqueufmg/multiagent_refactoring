    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileSystem.NameLengthStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely an empty or minimal interface/enumeration. With only 88 lines of code and no complexity metrics indicating high complexity (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0), there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately simple."
