```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileAlterationListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 methods (nom=8, wmc=8) and 47 lines of code (loc=47), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no public fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class maintains good cohesion. The negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) suggests good method cohesion within the class. The low complexity metrics and small size indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
