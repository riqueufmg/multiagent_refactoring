    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReadAheadInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 20 methods (nom), 401 lines of code (loc), and weighted method count of 48 (wmc). It also has significant dependencies on other classes including a Builder pattern implementation, suggesting it could be further decomposed into smaller, more focused components to reduce size and implementation complexity."
