    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is a very simple class that does not exhibit complexity requiring further decomposition. The low LOC (37) and absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) support that this is a minimal class that does not suffer from insufficient modularization."
