    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.CountingPathVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 20 methods (nom), 23 weighted method count (wmc), 226 lines of code (loc), and 9 fields (nof). The class also has multiple dependencies (7 external dependencies) and a moderate lack of cohesion (lcom 0.35), suggesting that further decomposition could reduce its size and implementation complexity."
