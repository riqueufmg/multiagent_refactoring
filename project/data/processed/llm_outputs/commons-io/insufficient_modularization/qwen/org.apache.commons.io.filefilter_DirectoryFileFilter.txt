```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.DirectoryFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 3 fields (nof=3), and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lines of code (loc=40) are minimal, indicating a small and focused class. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low depth of inheritance (dit=3) suggest proper modularization. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=1.0) indicates good internal cohesion. These metrics indicate the class is well-modularized and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
