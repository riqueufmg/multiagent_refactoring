    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.QueueInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 43 lines of code. The low number of fields (nof=2) and lack of dependencies indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple builder pattern implementation with insufficient complexity to constitute insufficient modularization."
