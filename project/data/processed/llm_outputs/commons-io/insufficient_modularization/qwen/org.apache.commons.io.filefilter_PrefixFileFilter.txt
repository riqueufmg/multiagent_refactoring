    "justification": "The class has moderate size (121 LOC, 11 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=11). While it could potentially be decomposed further, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization. The class appears to have a single responsibility focused on prefix-based file filtering."
