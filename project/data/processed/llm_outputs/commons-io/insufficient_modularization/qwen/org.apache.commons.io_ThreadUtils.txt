    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 2 private methods (nopm=2), 44 lines of code (loc=44), and a low weighted method count (wmc=5). The class is small in size and complexity, with no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies. The current modularization appears appropriate for the functionality provided."
