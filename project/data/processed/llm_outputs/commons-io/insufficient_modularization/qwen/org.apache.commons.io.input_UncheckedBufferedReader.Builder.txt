    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedBufferedReader.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 23 lines of code (loc=23). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The DIT of 4 indicates inheritance depth but does not indicate insufficient modularization. With minimal functionality and low complexity, this class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
