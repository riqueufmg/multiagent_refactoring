    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 29 lines of code (loc=29), which indicates a small and focused class. The lack of fields (nof=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1) suggest proper modularization. The class appears to have a single responsibility with minimal complexity (wmc=3)."
