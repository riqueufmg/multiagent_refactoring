    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low WMC=0. The LOC=34 indicates minimal code size. Without sufficient methods or complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately simple and focused."
