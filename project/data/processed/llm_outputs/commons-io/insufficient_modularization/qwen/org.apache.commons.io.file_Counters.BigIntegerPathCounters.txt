{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters.BigIntegerPathCounters",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion. Due to the extremely small size and low complexity, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that further decomposition would provide benefits, and the class does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
