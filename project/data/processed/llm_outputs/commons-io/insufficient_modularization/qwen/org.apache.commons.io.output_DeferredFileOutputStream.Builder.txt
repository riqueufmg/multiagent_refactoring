{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.DeferredFileOutputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 92 lines of code (loc=92). It has minimal fields (nof=5) and no public fields (nopf=0). The lack of methods and low field count indicate it is already well-decomposed rather than suffering from insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple builder pattern implementation with appropriate size and complexity."
