{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.spi.FileSystemProviders",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 5 public), low complexity (WMC=7), and reasonable size (56 LOC). While LCOM indicates some lack of cohesion (0.83), the class is small enough that further decomposition would likely not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity. The class appears to be a utility-style provider class with focused functionality."
