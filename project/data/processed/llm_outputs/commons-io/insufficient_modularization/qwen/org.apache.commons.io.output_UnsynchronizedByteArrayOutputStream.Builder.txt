    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.UnsynchronizedByteArrayOutputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0), WMC=0, and only 20 lines of code (loc=20). The low number of methods and minimal size indicate that further decomposition would not be beneficial, as there is insufficient functionality to warrant additional modularization."
