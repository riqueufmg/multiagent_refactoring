    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.UncheckedIOBaseStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) and 36 lines of code (loc=36), which represents a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=9) is low, indicating low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to be well-focused with a single responsibility. The lack of complex dependencies and low method count suggest sufficient modularization has been achieved."
