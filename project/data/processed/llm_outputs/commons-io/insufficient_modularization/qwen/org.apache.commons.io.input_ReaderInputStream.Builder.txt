{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReaderInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 45 lines of code (loc=45). It also has minimal dependencies with 0 fan-in and 0 fan-out. The low number of fields (nof=1) and lack of complex relationships (lcom=-1.0, nc=0) indicate this is already a well-decomposed, simple class that does not require further modularization."
