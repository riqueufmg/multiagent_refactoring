    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.SymbolicLinkFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 51 lines of code (loc=51), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and 1 public field (nopf=1), the class is not data-heavy. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's a simple, self-contained filter implementation. The LCOM value of 0.6 indicates reasonable cohesion. Given these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already well-decomposed and maintains a simple, focused responsibility."
