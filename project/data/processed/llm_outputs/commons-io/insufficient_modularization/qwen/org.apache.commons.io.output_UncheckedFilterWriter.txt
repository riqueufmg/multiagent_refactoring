{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.UncheckedFilterWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) and 108 lines of code (loc=108), which represents a moderate size. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 12, indicating reasonable complexity. While the class has some methods (11 private methods vs 1 public method), the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately focused on its responsibility as an UncheckedFilterWriter."
