```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.PathEqualsFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3) and 20 lines of code (loc=20), which indicates a very small and focused class. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains good cohesion (lcom=0.0). The low number of methods and small size suggest it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
