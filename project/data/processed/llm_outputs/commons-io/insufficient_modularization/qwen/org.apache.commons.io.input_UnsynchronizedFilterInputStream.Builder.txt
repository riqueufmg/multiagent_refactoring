    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedFilterInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 23 lines of code (loc=23). The Weighted Methods per Class is 0 (wmc=0) and fan-in/fan-out are both 0, indicating minimal functionality. Since the class has almost no implementation complexity or size, there is no need for further decomposition."
