    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.ExtensionFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=4, NOM=4, LOC=66) and appears to have a single responsibility focused on file extension comparison. The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion, and the small number of methods (4) and fields (8) suggests appropriate modularization for its functionality. No evidence of insufficient modularization detected."
