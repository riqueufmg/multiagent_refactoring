{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.CanExecuteFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 38 lines of code (loc=38), and weighted method count of 3 (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=0) and simple method count (nopf=2 public methods) indicate minimal implementation complexity. LCOM value of 1.0 suggests good cohesion, and the low number of methods and lines of code do not indicate insufficient modularization."
