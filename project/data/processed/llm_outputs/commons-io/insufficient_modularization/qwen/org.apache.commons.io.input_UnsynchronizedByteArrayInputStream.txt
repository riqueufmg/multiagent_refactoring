    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedByteArrayInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) and 193 lines of code (loc=193), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=23) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would require decomposition. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.1875) suggests good internal cohesion. With only 7 fields (nof=7) and 1 public field (nopf=1), the class is not overly complex in terms of data management. The class appears to be well-focused on its core responsibility of providing an unsynchronized byte array input stream implementation."
