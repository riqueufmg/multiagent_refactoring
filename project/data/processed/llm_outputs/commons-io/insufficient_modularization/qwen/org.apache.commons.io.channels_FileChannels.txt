    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.channels.FileChannels",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) with 3 public methods (nopm=3), and a moderate WMC of 20. The LOC is 118 which is reasonable for a utility class. There are no fields (nof=0) indicating simple stateless functionality. The class appears to be a small utility class with focused responsibilities, not exhibiting excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
