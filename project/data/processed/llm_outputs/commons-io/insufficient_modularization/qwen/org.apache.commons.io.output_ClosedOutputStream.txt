{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ClosedOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 49 lines of code (loc=49), with a low weighted method count (wmc=4). The lack of complexity (lcom=1.0) and minimal dependencies (only one dependency on IOUtils) indicate proper modularization. The class size and complexity are within acceptable limits for a well-modularized class."
