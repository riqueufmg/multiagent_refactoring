    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.SequenceReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods (nom=6) and weighted method count of 16 (wmc=16). The lines of code (loc=81) and number of fields (nof=2) are relatively low. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, lcom=0.0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be well-decomposed with appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
