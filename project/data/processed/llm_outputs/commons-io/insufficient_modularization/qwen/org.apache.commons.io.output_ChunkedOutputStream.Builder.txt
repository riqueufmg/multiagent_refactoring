    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ChunkedOutputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 25 lines of code (loc=25). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) is -1.0 which is inconclusive due to lack of methods. The DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) is 4 which indicates normal inheritance depth. Fan-in and fan-out are both 0, showing no external dependencies. Given the extremely low size and complexity metrics, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed and minimal in scope."
