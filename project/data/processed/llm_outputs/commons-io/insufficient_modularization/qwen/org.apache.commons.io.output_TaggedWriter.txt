    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.TaggedWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 42 lines of code (loc=42), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and a moderate lack of cohesion (lcom=0.5), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
