{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnixLineEndingInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods and WMC of 13, but LCOM value of 0.333 suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 84 lines of code and 5 fields, the class size is manageable. The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well-decomposed for its functionality. No significant modularization issues detected based on the provided metrics."
