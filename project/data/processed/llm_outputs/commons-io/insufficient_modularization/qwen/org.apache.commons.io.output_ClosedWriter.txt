    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 40 lines of code (loc=40), which indicates a small and focused class. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (wmc=4, lcom=1.0) suggest it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
