    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 32 lines of code (loc=32), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be a simple functional interface. The lack of complex dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and single dependency on Uncheck suggests proper modularization. The class seems appropriately decomposed for its functional purpose."
