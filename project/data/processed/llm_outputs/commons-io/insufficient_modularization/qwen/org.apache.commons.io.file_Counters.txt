{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods with a WMC of 7, indicating each method has an average complexity of 1. The LCOM value of 0.8571428571428571 is high, suggesting poor cohesion. With 309 lines of code and 7 methods, the class is relatively large and could benefit from decomposition. The class contains multiple inner classes (Counter, NoopPathCounters, PathCounters, NoopCounter) which indicates it's managing multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
