    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 36 lines of code (loc=36), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 nested class (nc=1) and no fields (nof=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
