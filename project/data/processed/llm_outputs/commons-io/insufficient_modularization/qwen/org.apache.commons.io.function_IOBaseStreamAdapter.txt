    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (1 public), 21 lines of code, and a low WMC of 2. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the single field suggests appropriate data encapsulation. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized with a focused responsibility."
