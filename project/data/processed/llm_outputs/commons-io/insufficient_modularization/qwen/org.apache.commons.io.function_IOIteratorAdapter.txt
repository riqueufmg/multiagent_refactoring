    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIteratorAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 22 lines of code (loc=22), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=5) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low number of methods and fields suggests it is already well-decomposed for its current functionality."
