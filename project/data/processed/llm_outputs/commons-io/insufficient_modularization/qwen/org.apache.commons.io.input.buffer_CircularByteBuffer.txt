{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.buffer.CircularByteBuffer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) and 196 lines of code (loc=196), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=34) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would require decomposition. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.1538461538461538) suggests good internal cohesion. With only 4 fields (nof=4) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains a focused responsibility. The class appears to be well-modularized for its purpose as a circular byte buffer implementation."
