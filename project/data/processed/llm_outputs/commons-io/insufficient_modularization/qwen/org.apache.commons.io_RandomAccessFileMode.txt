    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.RandomAccessFileMode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods with WMC of 24, indicating moderate complexity. LOC is 175 which is reasonable for a class with this functionality. LCOM of 0.25 suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be well-modularized with appropriate method count and complexity metrics that do not indicate insufficient decomposition."
