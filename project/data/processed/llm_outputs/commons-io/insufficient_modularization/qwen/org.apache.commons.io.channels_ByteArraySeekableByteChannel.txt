{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.channels.ByteArraySeekableByteChannel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18) with 14 public methods (nopm=14), high weighted method count (wmc=33), and 202 lines of code (loc=202). The high number of methods and complexity metrics indicate that the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
