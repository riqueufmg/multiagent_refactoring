{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileSystem",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 433), many methods (nom = 29) including many public methods (nopm = 17), many fields (nof = 17) and elevated complexity (wmc = 41). These values indicate the class is large and relatively complex and could likely be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. (LCOM = 0.172 suggests reasonable cohesion, but the absolute method/field counts and LOC still justify considering decomposition.)"
