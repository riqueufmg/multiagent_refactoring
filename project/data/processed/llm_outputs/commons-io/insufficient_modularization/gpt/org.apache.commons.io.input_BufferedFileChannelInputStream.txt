    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BufferedFileChannelInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size and complexity: loc=191 and WMC=27 indicate substantial implementation and control complexity. Many operations: NOM=15 (NOPM=10 public methods) suggests multiple responsibilities/behaviors that could be split. Low-to-moderate cohesion: LCOM=0.333 implies the class is not highly cohesive and methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility. Small state relative to behavior: NOF=3 fields while having many methods indicates behavior is not clustered around shared data and can be factored out. Presence of an inner Builder (dependency listed) further suggests multiple roles (construction + I/O logic). Together these elements point to insufficient modularization and opportunity to decompose the class to reduce size and complexity."
