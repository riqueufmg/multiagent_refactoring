    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.LineIterator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate possible insufficient modularization: LOC=116 and WMC=15 (non-trivial size and complexity), NOM=8 with NOPM=7 (almost all methods are public, large public surface area / multiple responsibilities), LCOM=0.375 (reduced cohesion that may signal mixed responsibilities). The class has 3 fields supporting 8 methods and depends on org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, suggesting it mixes iteration logic and I/O utility handling. These elements together justify further decomposition."
