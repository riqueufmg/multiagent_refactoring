    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.ScratchChars",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=42, WMC=0. It defines a few fields (NOF=3) but has no methods (NOM=0), indicating a simple data/utility holder rather than a large undecomposed class. Cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 suggests good cohesion. There are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Taken in isolation, these metrics do not indicate that the class requires further decomposition."
