    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=28, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods or fields to decompose and cyclomatic/complexity metrics are zero. Given these elements, there is no evidence of a large, monolithic implementation that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
