    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: moderate size (LOC = 109) and method count (nom = 14, nopm = 13) with only moderate complexity (WMC = 16). Cohesion is high (LCOM = -1.0), coupling is low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT = 1). The presence of a Builder inner dependency and a few external dependencies does not by itself imply an undecomposed class. Overall these elements argue against Insufficient Modularization."
