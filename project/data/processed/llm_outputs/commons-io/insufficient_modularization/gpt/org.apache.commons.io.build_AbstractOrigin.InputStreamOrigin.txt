    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: loc=34 (small size), nom=0 and nof=0 (no methods or fields to decompose), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 and no dependencies (no coupling that suggests further decomposition), lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion issues indicated). Although dit=3, the class' very small size and lack of behavior mean there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
