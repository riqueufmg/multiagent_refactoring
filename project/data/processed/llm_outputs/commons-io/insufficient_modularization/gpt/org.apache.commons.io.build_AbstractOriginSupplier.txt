    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOriginSupplier",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class appears too large/complex for a single unit: LOC=283, WMC=34, NOM=33 and NOPM=15 (many methods, many public operations). These raw size and complexity metrics indicate the implementation could be decomposed to reduce size and simplify logic. (LCOM=0.0606 shows the class is cohesive, but cohesion does not negate that its absolute size/complexity metrics warrant further decomposition.)"
