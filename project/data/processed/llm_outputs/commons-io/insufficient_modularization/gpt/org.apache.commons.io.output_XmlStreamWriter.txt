    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.XmlStreamWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (LOC=193) combined with a high cyclomatic/complexity metric (WMC=24), many methods (nom=13) and many public methods (nopm=10) which indicate a broad interface and multiple responsibilities. Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.3846) rather than high, suggesting the methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility. DIT=0 (no inheritance decomposition) and presence of a nested Builder dependency further indicate responsibility mixing inside the class. These factors together justify decomposing the class into smaller, more focused components."
