    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that needs decomposition: loc=26 (small), nom=0 and nof=0 (no methods or fields to decompose), wmc=0 (no implementation complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling suggesting internal bloat). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion data/applicability. DIT=4 shows depth but not size/complexity. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
