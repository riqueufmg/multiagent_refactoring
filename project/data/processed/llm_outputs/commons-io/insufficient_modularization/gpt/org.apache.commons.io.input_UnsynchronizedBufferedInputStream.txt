    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedBufferedInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=284) and high implementation complexity (wmc=46) with a non-trivial number of methods (nom=11, nopm=8) which indicates multiple responsibilities that could be split. It also declares/depends on an inner Builder (org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedBufferedInputStream.Builder), suggesting combined construction/behavior roles. Although LCOM is low (0.1818) indicating cohesion among members, the absolute size and complexity (loc and wmc) justify further decomposition to reduce class size and implementation complexity."
