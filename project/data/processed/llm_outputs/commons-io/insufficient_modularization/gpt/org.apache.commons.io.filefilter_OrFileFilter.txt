{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.OrFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a moderate number of methods (nom=15, nopm=13) and a moderate complexity (wmc=15), its overall size is small (loc=124), it maintains very little state (nof=2), and it shows good cohesion (lcom=0.2). These indicators suggest the class implements a focused responsibility rather than multiple unrelated duties, so there is no strong evidence that it is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from further decomposition."
