    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.EmptyFileFilter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LCOM=1.0 (complete lack of cohesion) indicates the methods do not work on a common set of fields; the class has 3 fields (nof=3) and 3 methods (nom=3) yet a relatively high complexity (WMC=7) and size (LOC=56) for such a small API surface. DIT=3 shows a non-trivial inheritance depth that can mask multiple responsibilities. fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate the class is self-contained, so internal cohesion problems point to insufficient decomposition. These elements together justify that the class has not been sufficiently modularized and could be decomposed to reduce complexity and improve cohesion."
