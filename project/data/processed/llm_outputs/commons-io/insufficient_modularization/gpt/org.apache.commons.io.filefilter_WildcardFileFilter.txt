    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.WildcardFileFilter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs that it can be further decomposed: relatively large size (loc = 189) combined with many methods (nom = 15) and many public methods (nopm = 11) indicate multiple responsibilities; moderately high complexity (wmc = 15) suggests implementation complexity that decomposition could reduce; non-trivial number of fields (nof = 5) and inheritance depth (dit = 3) increase class surface and maintenance burden; the class is isolated in usage (fanin = 0) so splitting it is unlikely to cause widespread coupling issues; although cohesion is not extremely low (lcom = 0.4), the size/complexity and public API surface justify considering decomposition into smaller, focused classes or helper components (noting existing dependencies: org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils, IOCase, PathUtils and an internal Builder) to reduce size and complexity."
