    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.MessageDigestCalculatingInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 138) combined with multiple methods (nom = 7) and many public methods (nopm = 5) indicates multiple responsibilities exposed. Complexity is moderate (wmc = 7) and cohesion is only moderate/low (lcom = 0.5714285714285714), suggesting functionality is not highly focused. The presence of a Builder dependency implies additional construction/responsibility logic is bundled with stream/digest behavior. Together these elements (LOC, NOM/NOPM, WMC, LCOM, Builder dependency) justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
