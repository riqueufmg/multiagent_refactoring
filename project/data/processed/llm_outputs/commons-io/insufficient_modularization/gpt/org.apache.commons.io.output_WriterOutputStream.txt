{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.WriterOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class size and complexity are elevated (loc=278, wmc=26, nom=17, nopm=13), cohesion is high (lcom=0.1176470588235294) and there are no public fields (nopf=0). The class has a moderate number of fields (nof=8) and no inheritance depth or children (dit=0, nc=0), indicating a self-contained, cohesive implementation. Considering the class in isolation, the high cohesion outweighs size/complexity signals, so there is no clear evidence of insufficient modularization."
