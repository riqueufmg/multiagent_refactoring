    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BOMInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has small size and low complexity: LOC=52, WMC=0, NOM=0. Cohesion indicator not showing fragmentation (LCOM=-1.0). Low coupling: fanin=0, fanout=0 and a single external dependency (org.apache.commons.io.ByteOrderMark). Only 3 fields (NOF=3) and no methods suggests a simple builder/data holder; given the small footprint and low complexity, there is no evidence that it has not been sufficiently decomposed."
