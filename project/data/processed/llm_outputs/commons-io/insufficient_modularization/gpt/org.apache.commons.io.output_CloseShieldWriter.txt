    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.CloseShieldWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=29, NOM=3, WMC=3. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it depends only on org.apache.commons.io.output.ClosedWriter. DIT=1 and LCOM value does not indicate poor cohesion. Given its small size, low complexity and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed."
