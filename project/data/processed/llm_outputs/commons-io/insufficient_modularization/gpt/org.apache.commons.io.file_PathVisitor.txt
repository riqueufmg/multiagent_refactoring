    "justification": "Class is very small and shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: loc=6, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Additional metrics (nc=2, lcom=-1.0) do not indicate a large, complex, or highly cohesive class that needs further decomposition. Therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
