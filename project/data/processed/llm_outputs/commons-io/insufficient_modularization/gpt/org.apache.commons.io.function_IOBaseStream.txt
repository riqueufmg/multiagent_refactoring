    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: modest size (loc=92), moderate method count (nom=11) and complexity (wmc=11) without excessive growth; high cohesion (lcom=-1.0) suggests methods are related; no fields (nof=0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) reduce need for further decomposition. Dependencies list is small and there is no evidence of a large, monolithic responsibility that would require splitting."
