    "justification": "The class is very small and not a candidate for further decomposition: low lines of code (loc = 21), a single field (nof = 1) and no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0). Complexity and cohesion indicators are minimal (wmc = 0, nc = 0, lcom = -1.0) and there are no cross-class couplings (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dependencies = []). Given this compact size and lack of internal complexity, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
