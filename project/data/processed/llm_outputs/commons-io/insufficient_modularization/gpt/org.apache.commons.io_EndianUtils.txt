    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.EndianUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: large size (loc=355), many methods (nom=32) with most public (nopm=30), and high overall complexity (wmc=35). These metrics indicate the class is doing too much in a single unit (many public operations and substantial implementation volume), suggesting it should be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
