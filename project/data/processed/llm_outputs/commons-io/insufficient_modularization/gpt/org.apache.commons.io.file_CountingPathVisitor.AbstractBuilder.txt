    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.CountingPathVisitor.AbstractBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: modest size (loc=65), few fields (nof=4), no methods (nom=0) and no cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 2 listed dependencies). Cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not suggest low cohesion. Given the lack of internal complexity or many responsibilities, there is no evidence here that the class should be further decomposed."
