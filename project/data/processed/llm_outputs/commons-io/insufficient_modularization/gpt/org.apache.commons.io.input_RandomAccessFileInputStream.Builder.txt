    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that is too large or complex: loc=43, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no cyclomatic complexity), fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]; LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable given no methods). Although DIT=4, in isolation there is no evidence of high implementation size or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
