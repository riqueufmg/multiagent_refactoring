    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization. Evidence: LOC=110 (moderate size), WMC=11 (moderate complexity), NOM=11 (method count reasonable), NOF=3 (few fields), LCOM=0.3636363636363636 (low LCOM → relatively high cohesion), DIT=3 (inheritance depth only), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling/external interactions), single dependency on org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils. These metrics indicate the class is cohesive and not overly large or complex such that further decomposition is clearly warranted."
