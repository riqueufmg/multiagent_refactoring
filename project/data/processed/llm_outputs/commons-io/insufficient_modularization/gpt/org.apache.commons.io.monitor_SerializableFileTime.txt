    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=54, NOM=11, NOF=3. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Cyclomatic load is modest (WMC=13) distributed over many methods (avg complexity ≈1.18), public surface is small (NOPM=4). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single external dependency). These indicators do not show an undivided, overly large or complex class that requires further decomposition."
