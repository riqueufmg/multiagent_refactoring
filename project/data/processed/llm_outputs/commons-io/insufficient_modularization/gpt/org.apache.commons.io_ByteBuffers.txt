    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=33, nom=4, wmc=4 indicate low size and complexity. lcom=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. nof=0 and nopf=0 show no fields to split out, and fanin=0/fanout=0 indicate low coupling. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
