    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, noncomposite class: LOC=11, NOF=0, NOM=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, no dependencies. There are no methods or fields to decompose and no complexity or coupling that would justify further modularization. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
