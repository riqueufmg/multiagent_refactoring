    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReversedLinesFileReader.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=29), no methods to decompose (NOM=0), zero measured complexity (WMC=0), high cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0), and no coupling/dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The inheritance depth (DIT=4) alone does not imply the class requires further decomposition."
