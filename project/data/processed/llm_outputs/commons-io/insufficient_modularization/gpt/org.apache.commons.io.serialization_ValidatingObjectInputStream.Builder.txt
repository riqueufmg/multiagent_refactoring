    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: very low structural complexity (wmc: 0), no methods reported (nom: 0, nopm: 0), only one field (nof: 1), low coupling (fanin: 0, fanout: 0, single dependency: org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ObjectStreamClassPredicate). Although LOC is 123, other size/complexity indicators are minimal and do not support a conclusion of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
