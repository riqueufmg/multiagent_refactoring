    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.NullReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 209 and WMC = 30 indicate a large, relatively complex implementation concentrated in a single class; NOM = 16 with NOPM = 13 (many public methods) and NOF = 8 (several fields) suggest multiple responsibilities or a broad public surface that could be split. Although LCOM = 0.125 indicates good cohesion, the combination of high size (LOC), high complexity (WMC), and many public methods supports refactoring into smaller, focused classes or helpers. Fan-in = 0 and fan-out = 0 (and only one listed dependency) mean the class is relatively self-contained, so decomposition could reduce internal complexity without requiring extensive external changes."
