    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC=98 (moderate size), NOM=7 with NOPM=5 (limited number of methods), WMC=17 (moderate complexity), LCOM=0.2857142857142857 (good cohesion). DIT=0 and fanin/fanout=0 indicate no deep inheritance or wide coupling. No excessive fields (NOF=3, NOPF=0) or large public surface suggesting multiple responsibilities. Therefore there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization."
