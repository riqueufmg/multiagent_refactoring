    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, large or complex class: LOC = 25 (small), NOM = 0 and WMC = 0 (no methods/low complexity), LCOM = -1.0 (no cohesion issue indicated by available value), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling evidence). DIT = 4 alone is not sufficient to imply insufficient modularization. Based on these elements considered in isolation, the class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
