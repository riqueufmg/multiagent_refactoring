    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=55), few fields (nof=3), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These values suggest the class is lightweight and not overly complex or carrying multiple responsibilities. Although DIT=4 is relatively deep, in isolation it does not by itself imply the class is insufficiently modular given the lack of methods/complexity."
