    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size and complexity indicate insufficient decomposition: LOC = 272 (large class body), WMC = 33 (high overall cyclomatic complexity), NOM = 19 total methods with NOPM = 13 public methods (many responsibilities / external API surface), NOF = 7 fields (non-trivial internal state). Although LCOM = 0.1579 shows reasonably high cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high WMC and many public methods suggests the class still bundles multiple concerns that could be split into smaller classes or helpers (e.g., construction/configuration is represented separately as ReaderInputStream.Builder in dependencies). DIT = 1 and fanin/fanout = 0 do not mitigate the internal complexity, so further modularization is recommended."
