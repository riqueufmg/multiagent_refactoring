    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=20, nom=3, wmc=3, lcom=0.0. Low coupling and interaction: fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and complexity and high cohesion, so there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition (Insufficient Modularization not detected)."
