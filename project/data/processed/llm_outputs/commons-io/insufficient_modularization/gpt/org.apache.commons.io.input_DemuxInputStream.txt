    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.DemuxInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no sign of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=40), few methods (nom=4, nopm=4), low complexity (wmc=5), low number of fields (nof=1), moderate cohesion (lcom=0.5) and no coupling pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics and a single external dependency, the class is small and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
