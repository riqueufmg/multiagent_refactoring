    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being under-modularized: loc=21, nof=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]. LCOM=-1.0 (not indicating cohesion issues) and there are no fields or methods to further decompose. Although DIT=4, the class is very small and has zero complexity, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
