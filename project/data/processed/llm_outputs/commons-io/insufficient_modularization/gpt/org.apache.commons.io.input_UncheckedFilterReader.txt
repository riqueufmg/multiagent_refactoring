    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: total LOC is small (102) and overall complexity is moderate (WMC=11) for 11 methods (NOM=11, NOPM=10), suggesting methods are small/simple rather than a large monolithic implementation. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is zero (DIT=0), so there is no metric evidence of a single class holding multiple unrelated responsibilities that would benefit from decomposition. LCOM is not indicative (LCOM=-1.0), but the combination of low LOC and moderate WMC argues against further modularization in isolation."
