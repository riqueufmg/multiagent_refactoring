    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC = 77 (small size), NOM = 7 and WMC = 7 (method count and complexity are low), LCOM = -1.0 (indicates high cohesion). There are no public fields (NOPF = 0) and no coupling indicated by fan-in/fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics do not show a large, high-complexity, low-cohesion class that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
