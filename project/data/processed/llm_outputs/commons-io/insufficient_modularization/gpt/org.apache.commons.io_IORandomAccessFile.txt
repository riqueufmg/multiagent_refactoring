    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has small size and low complexity (LOC=56, WMC=5), small number of methods (nom=5) and fields (nof=2). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). There are no incoming or outgoing dependencies recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its modest size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
