    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=24, NOM=3, WMC=3, NOF=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). Although LCOM=0.6667 indicates only moderate cohesion, the very small size and low complexity do not justify further decomposition in isolation. Therefore there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
