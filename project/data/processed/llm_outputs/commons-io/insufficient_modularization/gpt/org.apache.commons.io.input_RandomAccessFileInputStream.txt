{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.RandomAccessFileInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization: low LCOM (0.214) indicates high cohesion, there are only 3 fields and a moderate size (155 LOC), complexity is moderate (WMC 18) and method count (14, 13 public) does not by itself imply multiple responsibilities. Dependencies are minimal (IOUtils and a Builder), and fanin/fanout are 0, suggesting a focused, self-contained role. These elements indicate the class is reasonably decomposed and does not need further modularization based on the provided metrics."
