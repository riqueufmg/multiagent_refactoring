    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show a small, low-complexity, cohesive class: loc=56, nof=2 (only 2 fields), nom=0, wmc=0, lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion). There are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the lack of methods, zero complexity, few fields, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or would benefit from further decomposition."
