    "justification": "Metrics do not provide evidence of insufficient modularization: the class has a small number of fields (nof = 4), zero reported methods (nom = 0) and very low reported complexity (wmc = 0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and there are no dependencies. LOC = 117 alone is not sufficient to infer a need for further decomposition, and LCOM = -1.0 indicates cohesion data is unavailable. Given the low structural metrics and lack of cohesion evidence, there is insufficient evidence to detect Insufficient Modularization."
