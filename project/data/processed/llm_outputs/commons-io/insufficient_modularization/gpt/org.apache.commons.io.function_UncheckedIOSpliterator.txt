    "justification": "Class is small (loc=34) and has low cohesion penalty (lcom=0.0), indicating cohesive responsibilities. Complexity is moderate (wmc=9) and number of methods (nom=9, nopm=8) is not accompanied by large size or high complexity that would indicate a need to split. No incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) further suggests the class is self-contained. Based on these metrics, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
