    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is minimal and does not require further decomposition: loc=7, nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). LCOM is not indicative of cohesion here. Given its very small size and lack of internal complexity or responsibilities, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
