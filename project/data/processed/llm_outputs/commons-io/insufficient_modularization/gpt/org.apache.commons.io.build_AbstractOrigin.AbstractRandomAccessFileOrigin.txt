    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: loc=49 (small class size), nom=0 and nopf=0 (no methods to decompose), wmc=0 (no implementation complexity), lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion problems indicated), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling suggesting undiscovered responsibilities), no dependencies. While dit=3, the absence of methods/complexity and small LOC means there is no evidence this class needs further decomposition in isolation."
