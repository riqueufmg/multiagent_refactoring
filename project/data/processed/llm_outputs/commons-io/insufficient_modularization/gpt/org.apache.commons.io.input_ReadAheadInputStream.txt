    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReadAheadInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely case of Insufficient Modularization because it is large and complex: LOC = 401 and WMC = 48 indicate substantial size and implementation complexity. It also declares many members and behaviors (nof = 16 fields, nom = 20 methods, nopm = 8 public methods), which suggests multiple responsibilities that could be split. Although cohesion (LCOM = 0.15) is not high, the absolute size and complexity metrics (LOC and WMC) and the presence of an inner Builder dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.ReadAheadInputStream.Builder) justify further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
