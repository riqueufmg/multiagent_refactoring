    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=19, nom=2, wmc=2. Cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not indicate poor cohesion. No incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency listed. These elements show no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
