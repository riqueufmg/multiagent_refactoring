    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.Charsets",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LOC=152, NOF=7 (NOPF=6 public fields), NOM=10 (NOPM=9 public methods), WMC=10, LCOM=0.6. The class has moderate size and complexity, exposes many public fields and methods, and shows reduced cohesion (LCOM=0.6), which together indicate multiple responsibilities and insufficient decomposition. These metrics justify that the class could be further modularized to reduce size and implementation complexity."
