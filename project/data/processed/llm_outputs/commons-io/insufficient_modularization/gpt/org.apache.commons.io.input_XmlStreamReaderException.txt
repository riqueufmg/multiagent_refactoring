    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReaderException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an insufficiently modularized class. Size and complexity are small (LOC=89, NOM=7, WMC=7), cohesion is good (LCOM=0.2857), inheritance depth is zero (DIT=0) and there is no coupling shown (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class has a modest number of fields (NOF=6) and methods (NOPM=7) consistent with a focused responsibility (likely an exception/utility wrapper). These elements suggest the class is sufficiently decomposed, so no Insufficient Modularization smell is detected."
