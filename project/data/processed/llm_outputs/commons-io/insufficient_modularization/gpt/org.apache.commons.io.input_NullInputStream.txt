    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.NullInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 238), high complexity (WMC = 34), and many operations (NOM = 19, of which NOPM = 15 are public). It also has a non-trivial amount of state (NOF = 7). These indicators suggest the class is doing multiple things and could be decomposed to reduce implementation complexity and size. Note: while cohesion is high (LCOM = 0.105), the combination of high LOC, high WMC, and many public methods justifies consideration of further decomposition."
