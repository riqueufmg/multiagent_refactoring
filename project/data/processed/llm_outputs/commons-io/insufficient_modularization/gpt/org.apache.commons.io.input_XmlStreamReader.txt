    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=541), high complexity (wmc=64), many methods (nom=25) including many public methods (nopm=15), and many fields (nof=24). These numbers indicate the class likely contains multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. Although cohesion (lcom=0.24) is not extremely high, it does not offset the combination of high LOC, high WMC, and large API surface, so further decomposition is warranted."
