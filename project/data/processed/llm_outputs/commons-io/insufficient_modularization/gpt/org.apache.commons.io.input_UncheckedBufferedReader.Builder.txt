    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and contains no decomposable implementation: LOC = 23, number of methods (nom) = 0, number of fields (nof) = 0, weighted methods per class (wmc) = 0. Coupling metrics are minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and there are no dependencies. Although DIT = 4 indicates depth in the inheritance chain, there is no internal size or complexity to justify further decomposition. LCOM = -1.0 is not indicative of poor cohesion given the absence of members. Therefore this class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
