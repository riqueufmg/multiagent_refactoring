    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=39), low complexity (wmc=3), few methods (nom=3, nopm=2) and few fields (nof=2). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). No inheritance (dit=0) and no external coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the class-level metrics in isolation, there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
