    "justification": "Metrics show a small, effectively empty class: LOC=25, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods or fields to decompose and no dependencies; cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) is not meaningful for a class with no members. Given the lack of size/complexity or identifiable responsibilities, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
