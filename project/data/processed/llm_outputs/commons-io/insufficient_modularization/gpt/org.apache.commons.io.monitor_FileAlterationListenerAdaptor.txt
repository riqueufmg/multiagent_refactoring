    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileAlterationListenerAdaptor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: it is small (LOC=60) with modest complexity (WMC=9) across 9 methods (nom=9) — ~6.7 LOC per method on average — and defines no fields (nof=0). Cohesion metric indicates high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). Inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1) and there is no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is sufficiently decomposed and does not require further modularization."
