    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear Insufficient Modularization: although LOC is 278 and there are 17 methods (nom=17), the cohesion is high (lcom=0.235) indicating related responsibilities, it holds few fields (nof=2) so it is not managing many independent states, and complexity is moderate (wmc=19). Additionally it has no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no external coupling indicated by fanin=0 and fanout=0. These elements suggest the class is cohesive and not an obvious candidate for further decomposition."
