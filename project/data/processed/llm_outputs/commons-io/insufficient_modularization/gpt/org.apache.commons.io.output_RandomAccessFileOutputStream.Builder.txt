    "justification": "Metrics show no evidence of a large or complex class: LOC=25, NOF=0, NOM=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, and no dependencies. There are no fields or methods to decompose, and LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metrics are not applicable. Although DIT=4 is relatively deep, in isolation it does not indicate internal size/complexity requiring further decomposition. Therefore there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
