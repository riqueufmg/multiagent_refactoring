    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.FileFilterUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a large, likely multi-responsibility utility: 43 total methods (nom), 42 public methods (nopm), 469 lines of code (loc) and WMC of 49 indicate substantial size and complexity concentrated in one class. The high number of public methods suggests many distinct operations/roles that could be grouped into smaller classes (factory/creation groups for size/name/type/composite filters). Dependencies list (multiple specific filter types and IOCase) shows it coordinates many different filter concerns. Although LCOM=1.0 indicates cohesion is not obviously low, the sheer method count, high LOC and complexity support that further decomposition (e.g., separate classes for size-related, name-related, type-related and composite/filter-composition utilities) would reduce size and implementation complexity."
