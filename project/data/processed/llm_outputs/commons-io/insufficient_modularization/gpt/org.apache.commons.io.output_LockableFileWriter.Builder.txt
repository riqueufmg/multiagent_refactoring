    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=58), very low field count (NOF=2) and no methods reported (NOM=0) imply limited responsibility; low complexity (WMC=0); low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0); high cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0). No metric shows a large, complex, or multifaceted class that should be further decomposed."
