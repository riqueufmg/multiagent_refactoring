    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, high-complexity class: loc=68 (moderate size), nof=4 (few fields), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods/low complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). LCOM=-1.0 is inconclusive. Given the small number of fields, absence of method complexity, and lack of dependencies usage, there is insufficient evidence that this class requires further decomposition."
