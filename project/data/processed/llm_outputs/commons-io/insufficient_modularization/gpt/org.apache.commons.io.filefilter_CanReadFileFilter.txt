    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=42, WMC=3, NOM=3. It has low coupling (fanout=0) and few fields/methods (nof=4, nopf=3, nopm=2), and no indications of high implementation complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition. These metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization."
