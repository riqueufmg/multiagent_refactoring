    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.WildcardFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: it is small (loc=76) with a modest number of methods (nom=6) and few fields (nof=2); overall complexity is moderate (wmc=9) and cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0), indicating related responsibilities. Coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT=3 shows inheritance depth, there is no evidence from these metrics that the class is large, overly complex, or handling multiple unrelated responsibilities that would justify further decomposition."
