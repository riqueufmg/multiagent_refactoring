    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=56, NOM=4, WMC=4 (low complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). It has few fields (NOF=2, NOPF=0) and few public methods (NOPM=1), shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The presence of an inner AbstractBuilder and a single external dependency (IOBiFunction) does not, given the low size and complexity, justify further decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
