{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ChunkedWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=54, number of methods=3, WMC=5 and number of fields=2. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and there is only one external dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils), indicating low coupling. Although LCOM=0.6667 shows only moderate cohesion, the low size and low complexity do not provide sufficient evidence that the class needs further decomposition. Therefore, there is no clear smell of Insufficient Modularization based on the provided metrics."
