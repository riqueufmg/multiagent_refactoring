    "justification": "Class is small and well-factored: LOC=21, number of methods (nom)=2, weighted method count (wmc)=2 and number of fields (nof)=1. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0) and there is no coupling to other code (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size and complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
