    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.CleaningPathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization when considered in isolation. It is small (loc=86) with a modest number of methods (nom=9) and only 2 fields (nof=2), indicating limited size. Complexity is moderate (wmc=14) but not extreme, and cohesion is reasonably high (lcom=0.333), suggesting methods share related responsibilities. Coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it depends on a small set of collaborators. Taken together, these metrics indicate the class is compact, cohesive, and not a clear candidate for further decomposition."
