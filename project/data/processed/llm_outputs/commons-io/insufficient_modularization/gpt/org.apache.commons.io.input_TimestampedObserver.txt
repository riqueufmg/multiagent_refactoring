    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.TimestampedObserver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=55, NOM=8, WMC=8 (low–moderate complexity), NOF=2, LCOM=0.25 (high cohesion). It has no inheritance (DIT=0) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large or complex class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
