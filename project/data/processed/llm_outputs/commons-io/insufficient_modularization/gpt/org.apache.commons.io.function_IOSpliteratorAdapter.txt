    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=16, NOM=3, WMC=3 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion. DIT=1 and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) mean limited scope and coupling. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
