    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it defines a large number of methods (nom = 22, of which many are public nopm = 19), is long (loc = 342) and has relatively high implementation complexity (wmc = 22). It depends on many distinct functional interfaces (15 different IO* interfaces listed), indicating multiple separate responsibilities collected in one class. These metrics (high LOC, many methods/public methods, elevated WMC, and numerous distinct dependent interfaces) justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
