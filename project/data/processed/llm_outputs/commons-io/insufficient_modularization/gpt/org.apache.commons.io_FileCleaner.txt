    "justification": "Class is small and sufficiently cohesive: LOC=79, NOM=8, WMC=8 indicate low size and moderate complexity. LCOM=0.25 shows good cohesion. NOF=1 (few fields) and minimal dependencies (2) imply low coupling. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class has grown large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
