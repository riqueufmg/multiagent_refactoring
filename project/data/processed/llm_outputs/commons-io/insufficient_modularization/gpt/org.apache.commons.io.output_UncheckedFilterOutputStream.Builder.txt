        "Class is small and non-complex: LOC=23 and WMC=0 indicate low size and no measured cyclomatic complexity. NOM=0 (no methods) and LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable) show no internal decomposition needs. Coupling is minimal: fanin=0 and fanout=0. Although DIT=4, the class has no methods or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
