    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.QueueInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=152 and WMC=13 are moderate but not excessively large; NOM=9 (NOPM=6) and NOF=4 show a modest number of responsibilities; LCOM=0.222 (low) indicates high cohesion; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate low coupling; dependencies are limited. Overall size, complexity and cohesion metrics suggest the class is sufficiently modular and does not need further decomposition."
