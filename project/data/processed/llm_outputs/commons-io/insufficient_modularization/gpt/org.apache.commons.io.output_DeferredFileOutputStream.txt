    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Evidence of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC=322) and high complexity (WMC=25) indicate substantial implementation in one class; many methods and fields (nom=19, nopm=12, nof=12) suggest multiple responsibilities or rich internal logic that could be split out; low inheritance depth (DIT=1) means functionality is concentrated in this class rather than delegated; listed dependencies (AbstractByteArrayOutputStream, ByteArrayOutputStream, PathUtils, Builder) show the class touches distinct concerns (in-memory byte buffering, file/path handling, and construction/configuration) that are natural candidates for decomposition. Although cohesion (LCOM≈0.158) is not high, the combination of LOC, WMC, method/field counts, and cross-cutting dependency roles supports that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
