    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOCase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected. Although the class has 14 methods (nom=14), 12 public methods (nopm=12), 165 LOC and WMC=19, its LCOM is low (0.142857...), indicating high cohesion; it has only 3 fields (nof=3), no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no external coupling shown (fanin=0, fanout=0). The size/complexity is moderate and methods appear cohesive, so there is no clear evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
