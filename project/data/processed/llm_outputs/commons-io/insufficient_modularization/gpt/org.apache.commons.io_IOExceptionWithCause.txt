    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOExceptionWithCause",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=26, NOM=2, WMC=2, NOF=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are only two public methods (NOPM=2). Although LCOM=1.0 indicates low cohesion, with such a small size and low complexity there is no strong evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed or that further modularization would reduce size or complexity."
