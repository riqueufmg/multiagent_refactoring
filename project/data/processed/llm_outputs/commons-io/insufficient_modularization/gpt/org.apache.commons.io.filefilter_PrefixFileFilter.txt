    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate clear insufficient modularization: LOC=121 and NOM=11 show a moderate size; WMC=11 indicates moderate complexity; LCOM=0.3636 shows acceptable cohesion (not highly uncohesive). NOF=3 with NOPF=0 means few fields and no public fields. DIT=3 suggests inheritance but not excessive responsibility. Although NOPM=10 (many public methods), the combination of moderate complexity and reasonable cohesion argues against a necessary decomposition. No dependency fan-in/fan-out suggests the class is self-contained. Therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
