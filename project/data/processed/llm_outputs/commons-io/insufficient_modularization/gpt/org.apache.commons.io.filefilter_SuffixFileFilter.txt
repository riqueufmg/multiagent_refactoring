    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC = 121 (relatively small), NOM = 11 with NOPM = 10 (moderate number of methods), WMC = 11 (moderate complexity rather than excessive), LCOM = 0.4545 (reasonable cohesion), NOF = 3 (few fields), FANIN/FANOUT = 0 (low coupling). While DIT = 3 shows inheritance depth, there is no evidence of an oversized, highly complex, or low-cohesion class that would require further decomposition."
