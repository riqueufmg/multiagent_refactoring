    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOrigin.RandomAccessFileOrigin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc = 12), no methods (nom = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), zero members (nc = 0), and no coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and there is no evidence it should be further decomposed."
