    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=37), very low implementation complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0), only two fields (nof=2), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and a cohesion measure that is not indicative of fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). While the inheritance depth is 3 (dit=3), there is no evidence in the provided metrics that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
