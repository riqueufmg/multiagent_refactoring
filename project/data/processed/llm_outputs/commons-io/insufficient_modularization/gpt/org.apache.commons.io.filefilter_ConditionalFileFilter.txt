    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=31, NOM=4, WMC=4. Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0) and there are no fields to split (NOF=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and cohesive, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
