    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.TailerListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being too large or complex: LOC=29 and WMC=5 are low, there are no fields (NOF=0), a small number of methods (NOM=5), and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The negative LCOM value indicates high cohesion/interface-like structure. Given these metrics in isolation, further decomposition does not appear warranted."
