    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedFilterReader.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has small size and low complexity (LOC=22, WMC=0), no declared methods/fields counts (nom=0, nopm=0, nopf=0), and no inter-class coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Given these metrics and analyzing the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it is insufficiently modularized or that it should be further decomposed."
