    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and complex in isolation: LOC = 928, NOM (total methods) = 48 with NOPM (public methods) = 33, NOF (fields) = 16 and WMC = 167. These values indicate substantial size and implementation complexity and a wide public API surface that suggests multiple responsibilities. DIT = 0 (no inheritance benefit) and the class stands alone with only two listed dependencies, which increases the likelihood that functionality is concentrated in this single class. Although LCOM = 0.104 indicates cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high method count and high WMC justifies that further decomposition/modularization could reduce size and implementation complexity."
