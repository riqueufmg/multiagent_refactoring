    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=35, number of methods NOM=0, weighted method count WMC=0, number of fields NOF=1. No incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate fragmentation. Given the minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
