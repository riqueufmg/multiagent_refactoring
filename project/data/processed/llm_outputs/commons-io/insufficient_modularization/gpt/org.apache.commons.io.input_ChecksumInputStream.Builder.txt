    "justification": "No evidence of insufficient modularization: nom=0 (no methods) and wmc=0 indicate no internal implementation complexity to decompose; nof=3 fields with loc=62 is moderate size but not large enough alone to justify further decomposition; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling that would suggest responsibility bloat; lcom=-1.0 indicates cohesion metrics are not applicable (no methods). Based on these metrics in isolation, the class does not show the typical signs (high LOC, high WMC, many methods/fields, low cohesion) of Insufficient Modularization."
