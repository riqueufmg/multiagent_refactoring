    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOExceptionList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive. Metrics show LOC=88 and NOM=11 (moderate size), WMC=12 (moderate complexity) and LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). It has only 2 fields (NOF=2, no public fields) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the moderate size/complexity and strong cohesion, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
