    "justification": "Class is small and highly cohesive: loc=28, nom=5, wmc=5, nof=1, lcom=0.0. Low complexity (wmc=5), few methods (nom=5) and a single field (nof=1) indicate no need for further decomposition. Additionally fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling that would motivate modularization. Based on these metrics considered in isolation, Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
