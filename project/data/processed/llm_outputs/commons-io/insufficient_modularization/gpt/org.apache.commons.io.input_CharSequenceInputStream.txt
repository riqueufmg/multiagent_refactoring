    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CharSequenceInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=237 (large size), WMC=32 (high implementation complexity), NOM=18 with NOPM=14 (many methods and a large public surface), NOF=7 (multiple fields), and LCOM=0.3889 (only moderate cohesion). The presence of an inner Builder (org.apache.commons.io.input.CharSequenceInputStream.Builder) further indicates multiple responsibilities/groups of behavior. Together these metrics suggest the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split to reduce size and complexity."
