    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=61, NOM=6, WMC=6, one field (NOF=1) and low LCOM=0.333 indicating reasonable cohesion. No inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no external coupling in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate a large or overly complex class that would benefit from further decomposition."
