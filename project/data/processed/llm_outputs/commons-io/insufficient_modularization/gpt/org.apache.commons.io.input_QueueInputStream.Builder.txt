    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.QueueInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=43, number of fields=2, number of methods=0 (nom=0), and low complexity (WMC=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) does not suggest poor cohesion. Although DIT=4, the class itself contains no behavior to decompose further. These elements indicate no need for additional decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
