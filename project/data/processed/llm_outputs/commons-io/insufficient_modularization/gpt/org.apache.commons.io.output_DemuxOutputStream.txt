    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.DemuxOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No — metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class is small (loc=49) with few methods (nom=5, nopm=5) and only one field (nof=1). Complexity is moderate (wmc=7) and cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.4). There is no evidence of high coupling or large API surface (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). These values suggest a focused, appropriately-sized class rather than one that requires further decomposition."
