    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.DelegateFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC = 66, NOM = 5, WMC = 7 indicate limited size and complexity. LCOM = 0.0 suggests high cohesion (no sign of unrelated responsibilities). NOF = 3 and no fanout/fanin (0) show few fields and no high coupling that would motivate splitting. DIT = 3 alone does not imply the class is insufficiently modularized. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
