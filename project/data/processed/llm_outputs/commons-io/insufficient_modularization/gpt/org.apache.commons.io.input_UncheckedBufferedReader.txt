    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedBufferedReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is moderate in size and complexity and appears cohesive: LOC=109, NOM=12, WMC=12. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0). The class has no fields (NOF=0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only the listed dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck and org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedBufferedReader.Builder). Given the moderate number of methods, acceptable complexity, and high cohesion, there is no strong evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed."
