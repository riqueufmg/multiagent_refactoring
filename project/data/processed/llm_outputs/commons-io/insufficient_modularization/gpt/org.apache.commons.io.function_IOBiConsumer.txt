    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and low complexity (loc=48, nom=4, wmc=4), has no fields to split (nof=0), shows high cohesion (lcom=-1.0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0; only 2 listed dependencies). These metrics indicate the class is already sufficiently modular and does not require further decomposition."
