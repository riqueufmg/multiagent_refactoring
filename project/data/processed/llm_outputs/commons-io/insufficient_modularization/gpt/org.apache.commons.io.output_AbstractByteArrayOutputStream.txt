    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.AbstractByteArrayOutputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size (LOC=322) combined with many methods (nom=24) and a large public API (nopm=15) indicates substantial functionality concentrated in this class; high complexity (WMC=40) suggests internal implementation complexity that could be split; moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.5) implies the class may be handling more than one responsibility; non-trivial state (NOF=7) and presence of an inner/related type (InputStreamConstructor in dependencies) further suggest bundled responsibilities. Together these metrics indicate Insufficient Modularization — the class is likely a candidate for decomposition."
