    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undivided, overly large or highly complex class that requires further decomposition: LOC=194 (moderate size), NOM=14 and NOPM=11 (a limited number of methods), WMC=14 (moderate complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion), NOF=0 (no fields to split out), DIT=0 (no deep inheritance), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling). Dependency list is small (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). These elements suggest the class is cohesive and not excessively complex in isolation, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
