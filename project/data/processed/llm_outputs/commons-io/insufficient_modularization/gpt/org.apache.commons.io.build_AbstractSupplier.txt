    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=21, WMC=2, NOM=2 (NOPM=1), NOF=0. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0). Inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1) and fanout/fanin are 0, indicating low coupling. These metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
