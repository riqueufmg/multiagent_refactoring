        "Small footprint: NOM=6 methods and NOF=3 fields indicate a modest API surface not suggesting an overly large class to decompose.",
        "Moderate size and complexity: LOC=99 and WMC=19 show some internal complexity but not an extreme size that mandates decomposition by itself.",

        "Low coupling: FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 suggest the class is not tightly coupled to many other components, so modularization is not required to reduce coupling."
