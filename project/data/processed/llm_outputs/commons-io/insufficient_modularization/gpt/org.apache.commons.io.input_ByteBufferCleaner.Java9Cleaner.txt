    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=14, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, number of fields (nof)=2. Fan-in=0 and fan-out=0 indicate no coupling that would suggest internal complexity. LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issue reported). No dependencies. These metrics show minimal size and complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
