    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedByteArrayInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class size and complexity are moderate (LOC=193, WMC=23, NOM=16) but cohesion is high (LCOM=0.1875), suggesting responsibilities are related and the class is not a candidate for further decomposition. Field count is modest (NOF=7) and public method count is not excessive (NOPM=12). No coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) in the provided data suggest no external decomposition pressures. Based on these elements, there is no strong evidence the class has not been properly modularized."
