    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small size (LOC=98), modest number of methods (nom=11, nopm=9) and fields (nof=2), moderate cyclomatic complexity (WMC=11), and reasonable cohesion (LCOM=0.3636). No inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no external coupling shown (fanin=0, fanout=0). These factors suggest the class is reasonably cohesive and not large/complex enough to require further decomposition."
