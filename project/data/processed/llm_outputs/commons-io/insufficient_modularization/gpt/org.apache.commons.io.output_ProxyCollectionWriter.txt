    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs that it has not been decomposed: number of methods (nom) = 15 with non-private methods (nopm) = 12 indicates a large public/non-private surface; lines of code (loc) = 202 and weighted methods complexity (wmc) = 15 indicate substantial size and complexity that can be split; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 imply the class is self-contained and likely accumulates multiple responsibilities rather than delegating them; although LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate low cohesion, the combination of high method count, many exposed methods, and non-trivial LOC/WMC supports that further modularization (splitting responsibilities into smaller classes) could reduce size and implementation complexity."
