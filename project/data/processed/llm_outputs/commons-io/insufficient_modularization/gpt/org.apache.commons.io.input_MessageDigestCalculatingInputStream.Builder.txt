    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is small (48), number of fields is 1 (nof=1), there are no methods (nom=0) and no private methods (nopm=0), complexity is zero (wmc=0), cohesion metric is non-indicative (lcom=-1.0), and there are no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These elements show the class is small, low-complexity, and has no evidence of multiple responsibilities that would require further decomposition."
