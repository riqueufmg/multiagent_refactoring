    "justification": "Class exhibits size and complexity that suggest further decomposition: nom=22 methods, loc=212 lines, wmc=22 (high implementation complexity), and nof=10 fields (substantial state). Although LCOM=0.0909 indicates good cohesion, the combination of many methods, high LOC and WMC implies the class may not be fully decomposed and could benefit from modularization to reduce size and complexity."
