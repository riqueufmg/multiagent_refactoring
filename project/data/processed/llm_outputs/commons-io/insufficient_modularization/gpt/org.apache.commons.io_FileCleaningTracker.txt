    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileCleaningTracker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC=204 and NOM=11 (moderate size), WMC=14 (moderate complexity) and LCOM=0.3636 (reasonable cohesion). The class already contains an inner Reaper (dependency listed) indicating some decomposition, has a limited number of fields (NOF=7) and no outward coupling reported (fanout=0). Together these elements suggest the class is not excessively large or insufficiently decomposed, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
