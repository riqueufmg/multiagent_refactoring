    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.DeletingPathVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it defines 11 methods (nom = 11) and 3 fields (nof = 3) with a total of 114 lines of code (loc = 114) and a weighted method complexity of 19 (wmc = 19), indicating non-trivial size and implementation complexity. Cohesion is moderate (lcom = 0.3636363636363636), suggesting some methods may address different concerns. Depth of inheritance (dit = 3) and the listed dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters, org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils, org.apache.commons.io.file.StandardDeleteOption) point to multiple responsibilities (counting, path manipulation, delete-option handling) within the same class. Together these metrics and dependencies indicate the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
