    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undivided, overly large or complex class: LOC is 104 and WMC is 11 (moderate size/complexity), number of methods is 10 with a single field (nof=1, nom=10), cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.3), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Taken in isolation, these elements suggest the class is reasonably cohesive and not a candidate for further decomposition."
