    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization detected based on the class-level metrics: very high number of methods (nom = 57) with almost all public (nopm = 56), large size (loc = 563) and high complexity (wmc = 57). These values indicate the class is large and carries many responsibilities/behaviors that could be split into smaller, more focused classes or modules to reduce size and complexity."
