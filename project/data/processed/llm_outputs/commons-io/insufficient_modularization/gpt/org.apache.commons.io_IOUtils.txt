    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=2487), very high method count (nom=172, nopm=161 non-private methods) and high complexity (wmc=275); substantial number of fields (nof=18); only moderate cohesion (lcom=0.5407) indicating multiple responsibilities; and dependencies spanning many distinct IO concerns (IOExceptionList, multiple input/output stream and writer classes, Charsets, functional IO interfaces, LineIterator, nested ScratchBytes/ScratchChars helpers). The large public API surface together with high LOC and complexity indicate the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
