    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=20), very few methods (nom=2, nopm=2), low complexity (wmc=2), high cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0), and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). These values show the class is small, simple, and focused, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
