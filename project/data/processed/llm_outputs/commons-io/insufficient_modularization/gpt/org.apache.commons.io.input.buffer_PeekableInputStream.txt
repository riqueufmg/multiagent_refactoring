    "justification": "Class shows low size and complexity (loc=49, nom=4, wmc=6), high cohesion (lcom=-1.0), no fields (nof=0), and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). With a shallow inheritance depth (dit=1) and only four methods, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
