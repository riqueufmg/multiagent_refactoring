    "justification": "Metrics show no indication of an under-decomposed class: loc=25 (small size), nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no complexity), lcom=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0, and no dependencies. With no contained behavior or state to decompose, there is no evidence that further modularization is needed."
