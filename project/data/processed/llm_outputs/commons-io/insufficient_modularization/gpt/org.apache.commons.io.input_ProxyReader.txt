    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ProxyReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition when the class is considered in isolation: moderate size (loc=184) with a moderate number of methods (nom=14, nopm=11) and moderate complexity (wmc=14). There are no fields (nof=0), so the class has little internal state to split out, and the cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) suggests methods are cohesive. No incoming/outgoing dependencies are recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0). Together these elements imply the class is not insufficiently modularized."
