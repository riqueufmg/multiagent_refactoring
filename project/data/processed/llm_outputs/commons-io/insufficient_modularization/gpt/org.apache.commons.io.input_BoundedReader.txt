    "justification": "Class size and complexity are low: LOC = 87 and WMC = 10 with 6 methods (nom = 6). Cohesion is high (LCOM = 0.0), indicating related responsibilities are grouped. There are no nested types (nc = 0) and no inheritance depth (DIT = 0). Field count (nof = 6) is modest. No external dependencies are reported. Taken in isolation, these metrics do not indicate a class that requires further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
