    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=102 (moderate size), NOM=11 and WMC=11 (method count and complexity are moderate), LCOM=0.3636363636363636 (reasonable cohesion), NOF=2 (few fields), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (low coupling). Dependencies list contains only org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase. Together these elements show no strong evidence that the class is too large, overly complex, or suffering from low cohesion that would require further decomposition."
