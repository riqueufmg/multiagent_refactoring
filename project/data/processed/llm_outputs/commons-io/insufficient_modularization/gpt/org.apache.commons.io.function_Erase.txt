    "justification": "Size and complexity: loc=150 with nom=10 and wmc=10 indicates a relatively large implementation concentrated in one class. API shape: nopm=1 (only one public method) while total methods=10 suggests many internal helper methods that could be split into focused classes. Dependency diversity: references to 8 distinct functional interfaces (IOComparator, IOSupplier, IOBiConsumer, IOFunction, IOConsumer, IOPredicate, IORunnable, IOBiFunction) implies multiple responsibilities or roles being handled. Structural signals: dit=0 (no inheritance decomposition used). These elements together (large LOC, multiple internal methods, a single public entry point, and many disparate dependencies) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and would likely benefit from decomposition into smaller, focused classes."
