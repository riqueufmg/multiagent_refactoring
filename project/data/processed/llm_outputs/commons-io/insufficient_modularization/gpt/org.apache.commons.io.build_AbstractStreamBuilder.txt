    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractStreamBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high number of methods (nom=26) with most exposed as public (nopm=22) indicating a large public API surface; substantial size (loc=288) and elevated complexity (wmc=26); a non-trivial number of fields (nof=10). It also depends on multiple distinct utilities (org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils, org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, org.apache.commons.io.Charsets), suggesting it handles multiple concerns. While cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.269), the combination of large size, many public methods, and complexity supports decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
