    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undivided, complex class: LOC=94 but NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no behavioral complexity), NOF=3 (only three fields), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling), LCOM=-1.0 (cohesion not indicating multiple responsibilities). Because the class has no methods and no measured complexity or dependencies, there is no evidence from the provided metrics that it should be decomposed further."
