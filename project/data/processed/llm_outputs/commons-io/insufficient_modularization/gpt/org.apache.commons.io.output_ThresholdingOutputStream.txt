    "justification": "LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion; size and complexity are moderate (LOC=176, WMC=17, NOM=16) and do not by themselves indicate an overly large or multi‑responsibility class. Public API surface (NOPM=10) and number of fields (NOF=6) are reasonable for a stream wrapper. No coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest the class is self‑contained. Given these metrics there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
