    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: nom=12 and loc=108 are modest, wmc=12 indicates moderate complexity, and lcom=-1.0 implies high cohesion (no sign of disparate responsibilities). fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no abnormal coupling. Given these values and the provided dependencies, there is no strong evidence this class needs further decomposition."
