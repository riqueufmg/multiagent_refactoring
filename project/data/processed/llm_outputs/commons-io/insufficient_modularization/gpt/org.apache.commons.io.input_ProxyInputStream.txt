    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ProxyInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and has many responsibilities in isolation: loc=249 and nom=19 indicate substantial size and many operations; wmc=21 shows non-trivial internal complexity. There are 12 non-private methods (nopm=12), implying a wide public/protected surface that could be split into smaller collaborators. Although cohesion (lcom=0.3158) is moderate, it does not offset the combination of high LOC, method count, and complexity. The presence of an internal builder (dependency on ProxyInputStream.AbstractBuilder) further suggests multiple roles being handled in the same class. These elements together justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from additional modularization."
