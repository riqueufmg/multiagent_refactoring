    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=45, nom=7, nopm=7. Complexity is low to moderate: wmc=7. Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance is shallow (dit=1). Given the small size, low complexity, and high cohesion in isolation, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
