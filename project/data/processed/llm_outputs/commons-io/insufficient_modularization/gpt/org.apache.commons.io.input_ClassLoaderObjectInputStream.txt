    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=57, NOM=3, WMC=4, LCOM=0.0. It has a single field (NOF=1), no inheritance depth (DIT=0), and no external coupling indicated (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0). These metrics indicate the class is already concise and well decomposed, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
