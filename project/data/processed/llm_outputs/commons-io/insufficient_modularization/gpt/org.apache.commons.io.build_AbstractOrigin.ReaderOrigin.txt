    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: loc=37 (small size), nom=0 and nof=0 (no methods or fields to decompose), wmc=0 (no complexity), lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion concern given no members), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), dependencies=[]. Given the absence of methods/fields and low size/complexity, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
