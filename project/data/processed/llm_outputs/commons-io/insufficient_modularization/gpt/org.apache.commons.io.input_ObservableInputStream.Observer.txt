    "justification": "The class has no fields (nof=0) and no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), low size (loc=46) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no internal structure or responsibilities to decompose further; metrics do not indicate high size or complexity that would justify refactoring for modularization (lcom=-1.0 indicates no applicable cohesion data)."
