    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.NameFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=64), low complexity (wmc=4), small number of methods (nom=4, nopm=4), and high cohesion (lcom=0.0). Coupling and responsibility indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=1). These metrics suggest the class is compact and focused, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
