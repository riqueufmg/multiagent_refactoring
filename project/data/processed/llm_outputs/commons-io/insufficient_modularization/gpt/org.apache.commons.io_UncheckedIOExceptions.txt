    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.UncheckedIOExceptions",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=26, WMC=3, NOM=3 (NOPM=2). It has no instance fields (NOF=0) and no coupling indicated (fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 does not signal a cohesion problem. These metrics show the class is already compact and cohesive, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
