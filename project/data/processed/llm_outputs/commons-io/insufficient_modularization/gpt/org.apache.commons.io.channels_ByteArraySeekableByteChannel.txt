    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.channels.ByteArraySeekableByteChannel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has moderate size and complexity (LOC=202, NOM=18, WMC=33) and a relatively large number of public methods (NOPM=14), the cohesion is high (LCOM=0.166), indicating methods operate on shared state rather than unrelated responsibilities. The field count (NOF=6) supports encapsulated state rather than multiple unrelated concerns. With no external coupling shown (fanin=0, fanout=0) there is no strong isolated evidence that the class contains separable responsibilities that would benefit from decomposition. Therefore, based on the provided metrics in isolation, this does not indicate Insufficient Modularization."
