    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=16, NOM=2, WMC=2, LCOM=0.0. It has only 1 field and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) aside from a single dependency (org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils). Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
