    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.NullWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a moderate size (LOC=106) with many methods (NOM=11, all public NOPM=11) and overall complexity (WMC=11) while having very low cohesion (LCOM=0.909). There are only 2 fields (NOF=2) but methods are largely not sharing state (high LCOM), which indicates multiple unrelated responsibilities bundled in one class. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, so the class is self-contained but internally decomposable. These metrics together justify that the class should be further decomposed to improve modularity and cohesion."
