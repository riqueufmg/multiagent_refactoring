    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.StandardLineSeparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive with no signs of being insufficiently modularized: LOC=37, NOM=3, NOPM=2, WMC=3, LCOM=0.0, DIT=0, no nested classes, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. These metrics indicate low size, low complexity and high cohesion, so further decomposition is not warranted when the class is considered in isolation."
