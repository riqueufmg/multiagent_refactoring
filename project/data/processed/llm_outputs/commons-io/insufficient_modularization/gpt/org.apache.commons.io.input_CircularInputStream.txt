    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CircularInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=54, NOM=5, NOF=4. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Complexity is modest (WMC=10) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1). No incoming/outgoing coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0) aside from a single dependency on org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils. Given the small size, low method count, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
