    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.SymbolicLinkFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=51, NOM=5, WMC=5. Although LCOM=0.6 suggests moderate cohesion concerns, the overall size and complexity do not indicate an undecomposed class that would benefit from splitting. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 show it is isolated; DIT=3 does not by itself imply insufficient modularization. Therefore, there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
