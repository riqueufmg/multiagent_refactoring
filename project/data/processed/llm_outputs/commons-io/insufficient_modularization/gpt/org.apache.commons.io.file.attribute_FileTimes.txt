    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.attribute.FileTimes",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 225), high method count (nom = 24) with many public methods (nopm = 19), many fields (nof = 12), and high complexity (wmc = 26). Cohesion is relatively low (lcom = 0.708), indicating multiple responsibilities. These metrics together suggest the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
