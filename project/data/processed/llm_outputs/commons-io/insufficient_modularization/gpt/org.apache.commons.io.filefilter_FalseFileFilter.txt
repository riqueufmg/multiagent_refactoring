{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.FalseFileFilter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively high number of methods (nom=8, nopm=7) and fields (nof=4) for a small size (loc=62) combined with low cohesion (lcom=0.875). Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is non-trivial (wmc=8) while the class has several public responsibilities (nopm=7). These metrics together indicate multiple responsibilities and low cohesion within a compact class, suggesting it could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
