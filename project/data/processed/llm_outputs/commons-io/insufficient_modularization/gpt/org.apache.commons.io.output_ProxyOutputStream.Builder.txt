    "justification": "Metrics show no evidence of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=23), no methods or fields (nom=0, nof=0, nopm=0), zero measured complexity (wmc=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT=4, the class has no members to decompose and LCOM=-1.0 reflects absence of methods rather than low cohesion. No dependencies are listed. Therefore there is no justification to flag Insufficient Modularization."
