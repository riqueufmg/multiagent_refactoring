    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.TeeOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=67, NOM=6, WMC=6, LCOM=0.0. It has a single field (NOF=1), low inheritance depth (DIT=1), and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate low size and complexity and high cohesion, so there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
