    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows multiple indicators of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 394) and high method count (nom = 42) while exposing few public methods (nopm = 2) — many implementation methods are bundled inside a single class. High complexity (wmc = 44) suggests multiple responsibilities or complex internal logic that could be split. Shallow hierarchy and lack of decomposition (dit = 1, nc = 1) indicate the class is not decomposed via subclasses or nested types. The class also references many related functional types (listed dependencies), which suggests multiple responsibilities that could be delegated to smaller, focused classes. Taken together (high loc, high nom, high wmc, low nopm, dit/nc values and dependency set) these elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
