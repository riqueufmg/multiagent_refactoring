    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.InfiniteCircularInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=13, no fields (nof=0), a single method (nom=1, nopm=1), and very low complexity (WMC=1). Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0) and there are no external interactions (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large, or complex class, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
