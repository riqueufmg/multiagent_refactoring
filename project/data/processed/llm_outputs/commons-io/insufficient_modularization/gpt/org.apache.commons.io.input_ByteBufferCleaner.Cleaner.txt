    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and not complex: LOC=3, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0. Cohesion metric provided (LCOM=-1.0) does not indicate large internal responsibility, and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Given the absence of methods/fields and negligible size/complexity, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
