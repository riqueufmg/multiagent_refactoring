    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.MemoryMappedFileInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc=135), moderate number of methods (nom=10, nopm=6) and complexity (wmc=20) rather than a large, monolithic class; good cohesion (lcom=0.2) argues against poor decomposition; presence of an internal Builder (dependency: org.apache.commons.io.input.MemoryMappedFileInputStream.Builder) shows existing decomposition; low inheritance depth (dit=1) and no external fanout (fanout=0) indicate a focused responsibility. These elements suggest the class is sufficiently modular in isolation."
