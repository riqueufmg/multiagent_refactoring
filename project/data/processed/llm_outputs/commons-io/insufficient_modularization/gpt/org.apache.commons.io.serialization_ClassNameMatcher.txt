    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=11, NOM=1, WMC=1. Coupling and dependencies are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). No evidence of high implementation complexity or many responsibilities that would warrant decomposition. LCOM value (-1.0) does not indicate low cohesion in this context. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
