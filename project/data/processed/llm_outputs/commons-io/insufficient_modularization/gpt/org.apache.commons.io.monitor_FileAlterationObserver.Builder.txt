    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=49, WMC=0 (no implementation complexity), NOM=0 (no methods to decompose), NOF=3 (only three fields), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). Given the lack of methods/complexity and low size, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
