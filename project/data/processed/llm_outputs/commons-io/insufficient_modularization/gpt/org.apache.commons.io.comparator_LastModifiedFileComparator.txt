    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.LastModifiedFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity (loc=36, wmc=4, nom=2) with limited coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single external dependency (org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils). Although LCOM=1.0 and there are 3 fields (2 public), the class contains only two methods and low overall complexity, so further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or implementation complexity and does not indicate insufficient modularization in isolation."
