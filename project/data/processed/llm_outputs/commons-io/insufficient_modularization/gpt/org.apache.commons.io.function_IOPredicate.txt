    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: nom=8 and loc=73 (small size), WMC=8 (low complexity), no fields (nof=0) so no large state to split, LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion, and fanin=0/fanout=0 indicate low coupling. Only two dependencies listed. Overall the class is small, cohesive and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not justified."
