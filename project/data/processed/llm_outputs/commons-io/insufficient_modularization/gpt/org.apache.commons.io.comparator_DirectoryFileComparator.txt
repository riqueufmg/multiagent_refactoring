    "justification": "Class has small size and low complexity (loc=39, nom=3, wmc=3) and only a few fields (nof=5). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance is shallow (dit=1). Although cohesion is not ideal (lcom=0.6666666666666666), the overall low method count and low complexity indicate there is insufficient evidence that further decomposition would meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
