    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 1516), very high number of methods (nom = 109) with many public methods (nopm = 85), and high cyclomatic/maintenance complexity (wmc = 158). Cohesion is moderate/low (lcom = 0.6513761467889908), suggesting multiple responsibilities or behavioral clusters. It has a substantial field count (nof = 14, nopf = 8) and a large set of external collaborators (18 dependencies listed), all indicating the class likely contains multiple concerns and would benefit from further decomposition."
