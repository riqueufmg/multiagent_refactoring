    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ThrottledInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows modest size and complexity (loc=153, nom=10, wmc=15) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Cohesion is good (lcom=0.2) and it has a small number of fields (nof=4). The only listed dependency is an internal Builder, suggesting an internal helper rather than multiple responsibilities. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no strong evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized."
