    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.CloseableURLConnection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely case of Insufficient Modularization: it has a very large number of methods (nom = 48) and public methods (nopm = 45), high cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc = 48), and substantial size (loc = 151). These factors indicate the class is large and carries significant implementation complexity that could be split into smaller classes or components. Although cohesion is high (lcom = 0.0625), the sheer method count, large public API surface, and WMC justify recommending further decomposition."
