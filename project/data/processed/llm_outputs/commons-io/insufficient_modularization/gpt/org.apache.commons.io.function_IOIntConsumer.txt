    "justification": "Class is small and focused: LOC=46, NOM=4, WMC=4 indicate low size and complexity. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0). Minimal state (NOF=1) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large, or complex class that would benefit from further modularization."
