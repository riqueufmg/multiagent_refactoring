    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.NoopPathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=23, WMC=2, NOM=2. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0) and it has only one external dependency. Although LCOM=1.0 indicates low cohesion, the class has very few methods and fields (NOF=1), so there is no evidence of a large, monolithic implementation that would benefit from further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
