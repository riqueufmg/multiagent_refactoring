    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=44, NOM=5 and WMC=5 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show minimal coupling to other components in the provided data. Given the low method count and low complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
