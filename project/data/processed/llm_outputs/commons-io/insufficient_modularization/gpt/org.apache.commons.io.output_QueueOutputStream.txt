    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=43), low complexity (WMC=4), few methods (NOM=4) and single field (NOF=1). Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5) and there is no coupling evidence (fanin=0, fanout=0). These factors suggest the class is already compact and not a candidate for further decomposition."
