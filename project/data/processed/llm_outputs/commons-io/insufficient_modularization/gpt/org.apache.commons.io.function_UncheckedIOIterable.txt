    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.UncheckedIOIterable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low complexity: LOC=17, WMC=2, NOM=2 (NOPM=1), NOF=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and inheritance depth is zero (DIT=0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and there is only one dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIterable). These metrics indicate a single, cohesive responsibility with low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
