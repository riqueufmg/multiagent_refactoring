    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ObjectStreamClassPredicate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=111), many methods (nom=11) with all methods public (nopm=11), and elevated complexity (wmc=15). Exposing 11 public operations from a single class and the combined size/complexity indicate multiple responsibilities that could be split to reduce size and implementation complexity. Additional supporting metrics: nof=2 (few fields), lcom=0.2727 (moderate cohesion) — cohesion does not fully mitigate the high method count and complexity. fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate the complexity is concentrated in this class rather than distributed, reinforcing the need for decomposition."
