    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=14, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, NC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0, no dependencies. There are no methods or measurable complexity to suggest multiple responsibilities or a need for further decomposition. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
