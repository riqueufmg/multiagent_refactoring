    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=15, NOM=1, WMC=2, no fields (NOF=0) and no public/private method split (NOPM=0). Cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, showing no coupling that would motivate splitting. Given the low size and complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
