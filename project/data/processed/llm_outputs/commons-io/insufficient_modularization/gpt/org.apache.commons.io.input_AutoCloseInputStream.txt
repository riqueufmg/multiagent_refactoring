    "justification": "No. The class is small and cohesive: LOC=78, NOM=6, WMC=7, LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion), DIT=1. It has low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two dependencies (ClosedInputStream, Builder). These metrics do not indicate excessive size, complexity, or low cohesion that would justify further decomposition."
