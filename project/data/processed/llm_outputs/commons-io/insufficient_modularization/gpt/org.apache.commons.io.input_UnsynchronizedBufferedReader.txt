    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedBufferedReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 327) and high implementation complexity (wmc = 56) combined with many methods (nom = 15, nopm = 13) and a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 7). These values indicate the class contains substantial implementation that could be split to reduce size and complexity. Although cohesion is high (lcom = 0.1333), the overall LOC and WMC strongly justify further decomposition."
