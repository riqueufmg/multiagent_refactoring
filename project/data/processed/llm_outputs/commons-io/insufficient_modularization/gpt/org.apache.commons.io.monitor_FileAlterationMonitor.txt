    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileAlterationMonitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: size is moderate (loc=150) with a moderate number of methods (nom=13, nopm=13) and fields (nof=6). Cyclomatic/weight complexity is not extreme (wmc=23) and cohesion is high (lcom=0.1538461538461538), which argues against splitting the class. The class is self-contained in the provided view (fanin=0, fanout=0) and has only a small set of external dependencies, so there is no strong evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
