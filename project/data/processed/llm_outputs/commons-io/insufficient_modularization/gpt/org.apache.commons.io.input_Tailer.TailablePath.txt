    "justification": "Not detected: class is small and non-complex (loc=29, wmc=0), exposes no behavior to decompose (nom=0, nopm=0), has minimal state (nof=2) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate low cohesion here. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
