    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=56, WMC=8, NOM=5 (NOPM=4), NOF=3 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size and good cohesion. No external coupling is shown (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Given its modest complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence in the provided metrics that further decomposition is required."
