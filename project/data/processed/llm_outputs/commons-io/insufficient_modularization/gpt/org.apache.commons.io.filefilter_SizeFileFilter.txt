    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=70, nom=7 (nopm=6), wmc=8 (low complexity). LCOM=0.2857 indicates good cohesion. No incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and modest inheritance depth (dit=3). These metrics do not indicate an undivided, overly large, or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition."
