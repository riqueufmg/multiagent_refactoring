    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=26, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=1, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiFunction). Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0) and inheritance depth is modest (DIT=2). Given the low size, zero method complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
