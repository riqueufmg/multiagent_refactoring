    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LCOM = 0.666 indicates low cohesion among the class's methods; WMC = 7 with only nom = 3 methods (and nopm = 1 public) shows relatively high internal complexity concentrated in a few methods; loc = 39 and a single field (nof = 1) suggest the class bundles multiple responsibilities rather than being a small cohesive wrapper. The presence of a related dependency (org.apache.commons.io.channels.CloseShieldChannelHandler) also indicates that some behavior could be delegated. These factors together point to insufficient modularization and potential benefit from decomposing responsibilities into smaller classes."
