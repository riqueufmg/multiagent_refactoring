    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IO",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC = 11, NOM = 1, WMC = 1. It has no external coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and a negative LCOM (-1.0) indicating cohesion. There is only one method and a single dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). These metrics show low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
