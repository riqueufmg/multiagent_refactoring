    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.DirectoryWalker.CancelException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show evidence of Insufficient Modularization. Metrics indicate small size and minimal internal complexity: loc=50, nom=0, wmc=0, nof=3. Coupling is negligible (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no external dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem for this isolated class. With no methods and very low complexity, there is no metric-based justification to decompose this class further."
