    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOrigin.FileOrigin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: loc=30, wmc=0, nof=0, nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0. Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency: org.apache.commons.io.RandomAccessFileMode). The inheritance depth (dit=3) alone does not imply insufficient modularization. Based on these elements, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed and no smell of Insufficient Modularization."
