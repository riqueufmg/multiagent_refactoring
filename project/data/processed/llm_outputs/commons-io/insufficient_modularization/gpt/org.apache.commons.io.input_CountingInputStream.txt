    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class: LOC=91 (moderate size), NOM=9 (6 public) with WMC=12 (moderate complexity) and LCOM=0.444 (reasonable cohesion). The class has a single field (NOF=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a shallow inheritance depth (DIT=1). These elements suggest the class is cohesive and not large/complex enough to require further decomposition."
