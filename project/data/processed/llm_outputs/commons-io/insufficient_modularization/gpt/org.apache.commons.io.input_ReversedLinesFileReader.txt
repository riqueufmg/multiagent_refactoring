    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReversedLinesFileReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and complex for a single class: LOC=375, WMC=34 (high cyclomatic complexity), NOF=17 (many fields), NOM=18 (many methods) and NOPM=17 (most methods exposed). It also declares/depends on inner components (ReversedLinesFileReader.Builder, ReversedLinesFileReader.FilePart) and an IOIterator, indicating multiple responsibilities are implemented within the same class. Although LCOM=0.166 indicates cohesion, the absolute size and complexity metrics (LOC, WMC, NOF, NOM) support that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is detected."
