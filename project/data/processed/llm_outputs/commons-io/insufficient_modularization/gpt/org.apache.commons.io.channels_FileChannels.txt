    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.channels.FileChannels",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class has a small number of methods (nom=6, nopm=3) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating limited surface and state to split. Although LOC=118 and WMC=20 show some size and complexity, average complexity per method is moderate (~3.3) and LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Fanin and fanout are 0 and only a single external dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) appears, suggesting low coupling. Taken in isolation, these elements do not justify further decomposition."
