    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=26, number of methods nom=2 (nopm=1), low complexity WMC=4. Cohesion appears adequate (LCOM=-1.0). No incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
