    "justification": "LCOM = 1.0 indicates very low cohesion among methods; there are 4 methods (nom = 4) operating on only 2 fields (nof = 2), suggesting methods do not share state and likely implement separate responsibilities. Although overall size (loc = 40) and complexity (wmc = 4) are modest, the combination of high LCOM and small, isolated interface (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) implies the class groups unrelated functionality and could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive classes to improve modularity."
