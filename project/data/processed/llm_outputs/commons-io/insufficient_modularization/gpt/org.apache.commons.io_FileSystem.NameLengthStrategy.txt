    "justification": "LOC = 88 is moderate, but other indicators do not show a decomposable, monolithic class: nom = 0, nof = 0, wmc = 0, lcom = -1.0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0. The absence of methods/fields and zero complexity/cohesion signals means there is no evidence of an incompletely decomposed class that would benefit from further modularization."
