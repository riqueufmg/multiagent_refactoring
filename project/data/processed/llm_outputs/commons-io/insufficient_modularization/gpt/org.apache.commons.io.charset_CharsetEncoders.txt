    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=29, NOM=3 (NOPM=2), WMC=3. Low size and low cyclomatic/structural complexity indicate no need for further decomposition. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM value (-1.0) does not indicate low cohesion that would demand splitting. Therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
