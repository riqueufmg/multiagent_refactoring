    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=42, nom=4, wmc=4, nof=1. Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.5) and inheritance depth is minimal (dit=1). There are no outgoing dependencies (fanout=0) and no children (nc=0). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no evidence it requires further decomposition (Insufficient Modularization not detected)."
