    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedFilterInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: the class is moderate in size (loc=134) with a modest method count (nom=12, nopm=10) and moderate complexity (wmc=12). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.1667), there is only one field (nof=1), no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is reasonably cohesive and not excessively large or complex, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
