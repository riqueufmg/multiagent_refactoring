    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.HexDump",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate a single class that is relatively large and moderately complex: LOC=120 and WMC=16 suggest substantial implementation content and complexity concentrated in this class. It defines multiple methods (NOM=6, NOPM=4) and at least one field (NOF=3, NOPF=1), while cohesion is only moderate (LCOM=0.5), which implies the class may be handling multiple responsibilities. The combination of size, complexity, multiple public behaviors, and only moderate cohesion justifies that further decomposition (additional modularization) could reduce class size and implementation complexity."
