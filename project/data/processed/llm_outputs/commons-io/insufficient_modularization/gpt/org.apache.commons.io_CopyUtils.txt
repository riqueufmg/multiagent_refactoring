    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc=162) with a moderate number of methods (nom=13) and moderate complexity (wmc=15) rather than very large/complex; cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0) which argues against further decomposition; low coupling indicated by fanin=0 and fanout=0 and no inheritance (dit=0) suggests the class is self-contained. These values do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
