    "justification": "The class does not show Insufficient Modularization: size and complexity are low (loc=64, wmc=4), it has few methods (nom=4, nopm=4), cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), inheritance is shallow (dit=1), coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only one external dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOCase). The moderate field count (nof=8, nopf=6) alone does not indicate a need for further decomposition given the low complexity and high cohesion."
