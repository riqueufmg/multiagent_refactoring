    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer.Builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (loc = 124) and a relatively high number of fields (nof = 9) while reporting no methods (nom = 0) and zero WMC, which indicates data/behavior is not properly decomposed into smaller responsibilities. The deep inheritance (dit = 4) increases conceptual complexity and the reported cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) is not positive, suggesting poor or undefined cohesion. Taken together these metrics indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
