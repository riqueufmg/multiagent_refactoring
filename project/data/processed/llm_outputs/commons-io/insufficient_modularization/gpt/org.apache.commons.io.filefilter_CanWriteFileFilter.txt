    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.CanWriteFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class size and complexity are low (loc=38, wmc=3, nom=3, nopm=2). Field and member counts are small (nof=3, nopf=2). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and the class depends only on IOFileFilter. Although lcom=1.0 could indicate cohesion concern, the overall small LOC, low method count and low complexity do not support further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
