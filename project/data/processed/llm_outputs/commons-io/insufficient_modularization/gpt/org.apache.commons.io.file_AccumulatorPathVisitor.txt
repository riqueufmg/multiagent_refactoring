    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.AccumulatorPathVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: a high number of methods (nom=19) with many public methods (nopm=15) indicates multiple exposed responsibilities; non-trivial size (loc=178) and cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=22) suggest the implementation could be split to reduce complexity; moderate cohesion (lcom=0.368) implies the class groups somewhat unrelated functionality rather than a single focused responsibility; DIT=3 adds inheritance-related complexity. The variety of dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils, PathFilter, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiFunction, org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters, Builder) also suggests the class handles multiple concerns (path handling, filtering, accumulation/counting, construction). Together these elements justify decomposing the class to improve modularity."
