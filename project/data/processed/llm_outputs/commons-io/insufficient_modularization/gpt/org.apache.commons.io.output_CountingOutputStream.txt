    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC = 66 (small size), NOM = 6 with NOPM = 5 (few methods), WMC = 8 (low-to-moderate complexity), LCOM = 0.3333 (reasonable cohesion), NOF = 1 and no external dependencies or fanout. These elements suggest the class is small, cohesive and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
