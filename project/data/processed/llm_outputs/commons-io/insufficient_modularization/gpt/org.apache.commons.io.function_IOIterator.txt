    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=69, NOM=8, WMC=9 indicate low-to-moderate complexity and size. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. DIT=0 and NC=1 show no deep hierarchy pressure to split. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 and only two dependencies suggest limited responsibilities. These metrics do not provide evidence of an incompletely decomposed, monolithic class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
