    "justification": "Metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=38), low complexity (wmc=4), few methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and fields (nof=2). No inheritance (dit=0, nc=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LCOM=1.0 indicates low cohesion, the class is very small and simple—there is insufficient evidence that it needs further decomposition."
