    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.buffer.CircularByteBuffer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 196) and high implementation complexity (WMC = 34) combined with a substantial public surface (nom = 13, nopm = 13) indicate multiple behaviors or implementation responsibilities that could be split. It has few fields (nof = 4) but a large method set and no inheritance (dit = 0) or coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), suggesting a monolithic, self-contained implementation rather than a composed design. The dependency on org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils implies it handles both buffer management and I/O-related concerns. Although cohesion is reasonably high (LCOM = 0.1538), the measured size and complexity justify considering decomposition to reduce method complexity and overall class size."
