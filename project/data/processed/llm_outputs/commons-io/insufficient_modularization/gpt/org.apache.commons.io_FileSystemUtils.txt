    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileSystemUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=87, NOM=7, WMC=8 (low implementation complexity). LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. nopf=0 and nopm=6 show a limited public API surface. fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate minimal coupling. Given modest size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed (no insufficient modularization)."
