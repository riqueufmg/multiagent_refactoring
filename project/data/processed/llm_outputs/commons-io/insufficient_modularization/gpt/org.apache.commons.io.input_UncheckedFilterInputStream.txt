    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive — LOC=88, NOM=9, WMC=9 (moderate complexity), NOF=0 (no fields), DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate low cohesion. Given the modest size, moderate complexity, lack of fields, and low coupling, there is no clear evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
