    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: 17 methods (nom = 17) and 118 lines of code (loc = 118) with a moderate/high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 21) indicate substantial size/complexity. Cohesion is low (lcom = 0.8235294117647058), suggesting multiple, weakly related responsibilities. There are only 2 fields (nof = 2) while many methods operate on little shared state, implying method behavior is not well grouped. These metrics together justify decomposition into smaller, more focused classes or helper components to reduce complexity and improve cohesion."
