    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC = 123 (moderate size), NOM = 11 (method count is modest), WMC = 11 (overall complexity is low), LCOM = -1.0 (high cohesion), DIT = 0 (no inheritance complexity), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (low coupling). Dependencies are limited to related function classes. These elements suggest the class is cohesive and not overly large or complex, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
