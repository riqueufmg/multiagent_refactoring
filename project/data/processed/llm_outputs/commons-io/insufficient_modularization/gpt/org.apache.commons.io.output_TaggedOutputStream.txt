    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Analyzed in isolation: the class is small and low-complexity (loc=42, nom=4, wmc=4), has very few fields (nof=1, nopf=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and moderate cohesion (lcom=0.5). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and not a candidate for further decomposition; no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
