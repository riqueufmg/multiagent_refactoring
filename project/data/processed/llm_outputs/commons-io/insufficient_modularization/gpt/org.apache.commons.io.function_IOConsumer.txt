    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: nom=10 and loc=116 (moderate size), wmc=10 (low overall complexity), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion), nof=1 and nopf=0 (no state/fields to split), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no strong coupling to decompose). Although there are listed dependencies, the class size, cohesion and complexity metrics suggest it is already adequately modular and does not require further decomposition."
