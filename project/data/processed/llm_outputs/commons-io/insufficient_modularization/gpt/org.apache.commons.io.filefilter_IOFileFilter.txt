    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=68), modest method count (nom=7) and complexity (WMC=7), only one field (nof=1), and very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Given these values the class is small, cohesive, and not overly complex, so no further decomposition is indicated."
