    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.FileWriterWithEncoding",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 242), high method count (nom = 16) with most methods public (nopm = 13), and elevated complexity (wmc = 19). Cohesion is moderate/low (lcom = 0.5), suggesting multiple responsibilities. The class also contains an inner Builder (org.apache.commons.io.output.FileWriterWithEncoding.Builder), indicating construction logic colocated with writer behavior. These elements (loc, nom/nopm, wmc, lcom, and the Builder dependency) justify decomposing the class to reduce size and complexity."
