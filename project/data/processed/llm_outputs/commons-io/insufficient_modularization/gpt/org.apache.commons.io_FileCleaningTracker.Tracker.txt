    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileCleaningTracker.Tracker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate this class is small and not complex: LOC=39, NOF=2, NOM=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods to split (NOM=0), very low size and complexity, and minimal coupling (single dependency: org.apache.commons.io.FileDeleteStrategy). Based on these elements in isolation, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or needs further decomposition."
