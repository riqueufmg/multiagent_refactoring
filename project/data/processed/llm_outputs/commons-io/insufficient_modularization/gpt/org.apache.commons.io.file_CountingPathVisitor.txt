    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.CountingPathVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 226) with many operations (nom = 20) and a high number of non-private/public methods (nopm = 12), moderate-to-high complexity (wmc = 23), and 9 fields (nof = 9). Cohesion is not strong (lcom = 0.35), indicating multiple responsibilities or loosely related behavior. The class also references multiple collaborators (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter, IOBiFunction, AbstractBuilder, TrueFileFilter, Counters, PathFilter, SimplePathVisitor), and the presence of an AbstractBuilder in its dependencies suggests embedded builder-related logic. Taken together these metrics and dependencies indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity and improve cohesion."
