    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 2371), very high implementation complexity (WMC = 244), and an excessive number of methods (nom = 159) with a very large public API (nopm = 135). It also declares many fields (nof = 18) and depends on numerous collaborators (dependencies list contains many distinct utilities and file-related components), indicating multiple responsibilities. Although cohesion (LCOM = 0.3019) is not extremely poor, the combination of huge LOC, high WMC and very many methods/public methods strongly suggests the class can be decomposed into smaller, focused modules to reduce size and complexity."
