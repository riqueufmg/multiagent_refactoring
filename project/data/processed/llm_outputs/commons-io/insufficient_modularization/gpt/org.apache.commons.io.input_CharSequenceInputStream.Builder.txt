    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=41), very few elements (nof=1, nom=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), high cohesion (lcom=-1.0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These characteristics show no evidence that the class needs further decomposition. (DIT=4 is noted but, in isolation, does not justify decomposition.)"
