    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIteratorAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=22, NOM=5 (NOPM=3), WMC=5, LCOM=0.0. It has a single field (NOF=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling reported (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0), and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). These metrics indicate low size and complexity with high cohesion, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
