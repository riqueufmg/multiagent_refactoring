    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileAlterationObserver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows multiple indicators of being insufficiently modularized: large size (loc = 375), high method count (nom = 29) including many public methods (nopm = 16), and high complexity (wmc = 45). These values indicate a single class carrying many responsibilities and substantial implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposition. The class also depends on a variety of collaborators (FileEntry, IOCase, FileUtils, FileAlterationListener, Builder, TrueFileFilter, NameFileComparator), suggesting it mixes concerns such as file state tracking, filtering, comparison, listener management and construction. Although LCOM = 0.172 suggests reasonable cohesion, the combination of large LOC, high WMC and many methods/public methods supports refactoring into smaller classes or components (for example separating file state management, scanning logic, listener registration/dispatch and builder/configuration) to reduce size and complexity."
