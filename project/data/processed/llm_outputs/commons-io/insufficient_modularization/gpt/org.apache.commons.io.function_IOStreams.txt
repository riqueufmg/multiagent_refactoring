    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization detected: the class defines 8 methods (nom=8) in a small body (loc=42) with moderate complexity (wmc=8) but low cohesion (lcom=0.75), indicating its methods are not well related. It has only one field (nof=1) yet depends on multiple functional interfaces (org.apache.commons.io.IOExceptionList, org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOConsumer, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStream), suggesting it aggregates multiple behaviors. Combined with zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) this points to an internal accumulation of responsibilities rather than a single cohesive role, so further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
