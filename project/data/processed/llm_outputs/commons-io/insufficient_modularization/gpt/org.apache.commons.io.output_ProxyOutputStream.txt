    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ProxyOutputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large surface and internal complexity for a single unit: 15 methods (10 public), 188 LOC and WMC 18. DIT = 0 and fanout/fanin = 0 indicate the class is self-contained rather than decomposed via inheritance or delegation, and it only depends on two external elements (IOUtils and its Builder). The combination of many public methods, moderate-to-high method complexity and size suggests multiple responsibilities are implemented inside this single class and it could be further decomposed — consistent with Insufficient Modularization."
