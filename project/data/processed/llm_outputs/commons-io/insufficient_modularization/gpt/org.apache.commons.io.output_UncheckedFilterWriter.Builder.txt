    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.UncheckedFilterWriter.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: loc=22, nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0. No methods or fields to decompose (nom=0, nof=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 and low complexity indicate no internal decomposition needed. Although DIT=4, inheritance depth alone does not imply insufficient modularization. Therefore no evidence of a class that should be further decomposed."
