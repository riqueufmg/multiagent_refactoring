    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=38, NOM=5 and WMC=5 indicate low size and low complexity. It has a single field (NOF=1) and moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.4). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited. Although DIT=3 shows some inheritance depth, there is no evidence in the provided metrics of a large, complex, or monolithic class that would benefit from further modularization."
