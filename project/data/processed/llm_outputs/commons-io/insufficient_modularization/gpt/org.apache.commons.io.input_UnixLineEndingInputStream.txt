    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=84, NOM=6 and NOF=5 indicate modest size and surface area. Complexity is moderate but not excessive (WMC=13) and the class has good cohesion (LCOM=0.333). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, NOPF=0), so there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or excessive internal complexity that would require further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
