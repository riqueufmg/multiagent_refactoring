    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.MemoryMappedFileInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=27, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPF=0, NOPM=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods or fields reported that would suggest a large, undecomposed implementation. Although DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, in isolation the class size and complexity are minimal, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
