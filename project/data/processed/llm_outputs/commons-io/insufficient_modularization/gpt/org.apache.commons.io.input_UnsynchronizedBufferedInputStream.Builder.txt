    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedBufferedInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has small size (loc=24), no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and there are no dependencies, so there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or high implementation complexity that would justify further decomposition. LCOM is not meaningful with no methods/fields; overall metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
