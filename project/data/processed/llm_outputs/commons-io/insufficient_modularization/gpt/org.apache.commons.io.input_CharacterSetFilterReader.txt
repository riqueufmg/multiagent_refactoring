    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=29), few methods (nom=3, nopm=2), low complexity (WMC=4), and high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). Low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1) further suggest the class is already compact and focused, so no further decomposition is warranted based on the provided data."
