    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=29, WMC=3, NOM=3, only 1 field. It has no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion, the overall size and low complexity (few methods and low cyclomatic weight) do not indicate an undivided, overly complex class that needs further decomposition."
