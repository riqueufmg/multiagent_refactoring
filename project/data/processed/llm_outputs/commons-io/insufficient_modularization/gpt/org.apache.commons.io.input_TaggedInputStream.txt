    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=42, WMC=4, NOM=4 with only 1 field (NOF=1) and few public methods (NOPM=3). Coupling is minimal (FANOUT=0, FANIN=0) and dependencies list only org.apache.commons.io.TaggedIOException. Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5). Given the low size, low complexity, single field, and low coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
