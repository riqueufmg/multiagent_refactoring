    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=21, NOM=4, WMC=4 indicate low size and complexity. LCOM=-1.0 implies high cohesion. There are no fields (NOF=0) and no coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0) apart from a single dependency. DIT=1 and low method count (NOPM=4) further show the class is already simple and well-scoped, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
