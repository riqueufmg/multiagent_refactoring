    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ChunkedOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is modest in size and complexity (LOC=102, WMC=9), has a small number of methods (nom=6, nopm=4) and only one field (nof=1), and shows moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.5). There is no evidence of high coupling or excessive fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) that would indicate it needs further decomposition. These metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
