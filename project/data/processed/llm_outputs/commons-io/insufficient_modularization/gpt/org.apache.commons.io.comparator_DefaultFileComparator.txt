    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=29, NOM=2 (NOPM=2), WMC=2, NOF=3. Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1) provide no evidence of a large or complex class that needs decomposition. LCOM=1.0 does not indicate a need for further modularization given the overall low size and complexity."
