    "justification": "LOC=39 (small class size), WMC=0 (no measured complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion), NOF/NOM/NOPM=0 (no evidence of many fields or many methods to decompose), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling-driven decomposition signals). DIT=3 indicates inheritance depth but does not, by itself, imply an undecomposed class. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
