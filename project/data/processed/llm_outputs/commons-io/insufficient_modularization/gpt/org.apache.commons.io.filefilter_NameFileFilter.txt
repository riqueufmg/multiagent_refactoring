    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.NameFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Against Insufficient Modularization: the class shows low lack-of-cohesion (LCOM = 0.166), indicating strong cohesion; size and complexity are moderate (LOC = 121, WMC = 12); field count is small (NOF = 3) and public API is modest (NOPM = 10, NOM = 12). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, showing no evidence of sprawling external coupling that would suggest multiple responsibilities. Given these metrics in isolation, there is insufficient evidence to conclude the class has not been decomposed and therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
