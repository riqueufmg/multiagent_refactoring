    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=22, NOM=3, WMC=3, NOF=2 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size and low complexity with high cohesion. Fan-in=0, Fan-out=0 and no dependencies show it is self-contained. Given the small number of methods and fields, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
