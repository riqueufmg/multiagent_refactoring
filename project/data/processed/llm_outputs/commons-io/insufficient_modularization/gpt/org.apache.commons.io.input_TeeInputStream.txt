    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=88, NOM=6, NOF=2. Complexity is moderate and not excessive: WMC=10. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). These metrics do not indicate an undivided, overly large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition."
