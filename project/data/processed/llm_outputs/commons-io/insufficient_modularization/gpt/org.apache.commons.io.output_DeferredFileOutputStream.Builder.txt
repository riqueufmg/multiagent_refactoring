    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that is too large or overly complex: LOC=92 (moderate size), WMC=0 and NOM=0 (no detected method complexity), NOF=5 (moderate number of fields), LCOM=-1.0 (cohesion metric not indicating low cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling). Although DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, there is no evidence in the provided metrics of high implementation complexity or multiple responsibilities that would warrant further decomposition."
