    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=60, NOM=5 (NOPM=4) and WMC=8 indicate low implementation size and only moderate complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0 and only one dependency: org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). Given the small number of methods, low size, and good cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition (insufficient modularization) is needed."
