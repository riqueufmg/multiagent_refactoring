    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.AbstractCharacterFilterReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=61), has few methods (nom=5, nopm=2) and few fields (nof=2), and shows high cohesion (lcom=0.0). Although WMC=10 indicates moderate complexity, the overall size and method count do not suggest a need for further decomposition. Additional indicators (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) do not imply excessive coupling that would necessitate splitting the class."
