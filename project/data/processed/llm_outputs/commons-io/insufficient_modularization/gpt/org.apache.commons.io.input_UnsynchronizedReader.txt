    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs that it can be further decomposed: moderate size (loc=72) with relatively high complexity (wmc=10) for only 6 methods (nom=6). A large exposed surface (5 public methods, nopm=5) combined with only moderate cohesion (lcom=0.5) indicates multiple responsibilities or mixed concerns. It also has multiple fields (nof=3) while having no inheritance (dit=0), which suggests internal behavior could be moved to smaller helper classes or collaborators to reduce complexity and public API surface. These metrics together justify detection of Insufficient Modularization."
