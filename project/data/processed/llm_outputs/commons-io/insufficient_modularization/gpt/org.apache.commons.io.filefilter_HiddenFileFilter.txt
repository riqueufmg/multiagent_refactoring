    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.HiddenFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=38, NOM=3, NOF=3 (NOPF=2) and WMC=3 indicate low size and low cyclomatic/implementation complexity. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion is high (LCOM=1.0). Although DIT=3 shows it participates in an inheritance chain, in isolation the class has few responsibilities and low complexity, so there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further or that further decomposition would reduce size/complexity."
