    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileCleaningTracker.Reaper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=31), zero reported methods/fields (NOM=0, NOF=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. These values suggest the class is small and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided data."
