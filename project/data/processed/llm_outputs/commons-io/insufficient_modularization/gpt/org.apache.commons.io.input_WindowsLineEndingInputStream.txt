    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: small size (LOC=81), low method count (nom=5, nopm=4), moderate field count (nof=6) and moderate complexity (WMC=13) but concentrated in few methods. Cohesion is acceptable (LCOM=0.4). Fanin/fanout are 0, indicating the class is isolated. Overall these values suggest the class is reasonably small and cohesive, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
