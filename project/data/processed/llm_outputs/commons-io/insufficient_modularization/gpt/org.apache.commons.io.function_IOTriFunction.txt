Low complexity (wmc=2), only two methods, no fields, and no fanout (0) suggest a single, well-focused responsibility. Dependency list is minimal (only org.apache.commons.io.function.IOFunction). No metric shows excessive size or complexity that would justify further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
