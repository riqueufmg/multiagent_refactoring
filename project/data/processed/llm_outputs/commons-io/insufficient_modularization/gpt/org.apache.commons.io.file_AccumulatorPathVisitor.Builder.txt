    "justification": "The class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is very small (loc=14), has no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no external interactions (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). These metrics indicate no significant size or implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
