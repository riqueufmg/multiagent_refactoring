    "justification": "The class is small and simple: loc=40, nom=3, nopm=2, nof=3, wmc=3. It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating limited scope. Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion, the overall low size and complexity (LOC, WMC, method count) make further decomposition unlikely to reduce size or complexity significantly, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
