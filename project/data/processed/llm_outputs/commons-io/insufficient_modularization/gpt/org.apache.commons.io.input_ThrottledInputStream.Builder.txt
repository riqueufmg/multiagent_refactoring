    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, large or complex class: only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), and very low complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although the file has 74 LOC, the absence of methods and low complexity/coupling mean there is no evidence this class requires further decomposition in isolation."
