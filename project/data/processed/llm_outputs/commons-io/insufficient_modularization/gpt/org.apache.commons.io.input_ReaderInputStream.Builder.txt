    "justification": "Class shows low size and complexity: LOC=45, number of methods (nom)=0, number of fields (nof)=1, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. Cohesion indicator lcom=-1.0 and lack of internal behavior (no methods) indicate it is not a large/complex class that needs further decomposition. Although DIT=4 is high, in isolation there is no internal implementation complexity to justify an Insufficient Modularization smell."
