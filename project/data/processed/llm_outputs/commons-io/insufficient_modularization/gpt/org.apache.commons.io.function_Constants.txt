    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=41, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=7 (likely constants), LCOM=0.0. Low complexity (WMC=1) and a single method indicate no further decomposition is needed; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show it is isolated in the provided context. These metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization."
