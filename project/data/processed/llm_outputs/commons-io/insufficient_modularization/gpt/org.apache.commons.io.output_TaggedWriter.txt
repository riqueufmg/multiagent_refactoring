    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: loc=42, nom=4, wmc=4 and LCOM=0.5 indicate low size and modest complexity. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency org.apache.commons.io.TaggedIOException) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). Given the low method count and LOC, there is no evidence this class requires further decomposition; Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
