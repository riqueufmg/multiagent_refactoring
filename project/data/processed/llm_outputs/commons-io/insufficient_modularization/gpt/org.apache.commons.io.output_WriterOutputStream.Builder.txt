    "justification": "Class shows no sign of being an under-decomposed large class: zero methods (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0) indicate little implementation to decompose; only two fields (nof=2); low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0); modest size (loc=55) but not supported by methods/complexity to justify decomposition; cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not indicate poor cohesion. Although DIT=4 is relatively deep, the absence of methods/complexity means there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
