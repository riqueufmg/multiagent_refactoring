    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 309) while having a small number of methods (nom = 7) indicates large, complex method bodies or mixed responsibilities; low cohesion (lcom = 0.8571428571428571) indicates the class holds multiple, weakly related responsibilities; multiple fields (nof = 7) and several nested/related types referenced (org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters.Counter, org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters.NoopPathCounters, org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters.NoopCounter, org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters.PathCounters) suggest decomposition into smaller classes/modules would reduce size and complexity. WMC = 7 is moderate but does not counterbalance the high LOC and low cohesion, supporting the need for further decomposition."
