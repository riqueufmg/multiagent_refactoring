    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOSpliterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: size is small (LOC=90) with a modest number of methods (nom=11); complexity is moderate (WMC=12) and cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0). Additionally there is no incoming or outgoing coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics suggest the class is reasonably sized, cohesive, and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not indicated."
