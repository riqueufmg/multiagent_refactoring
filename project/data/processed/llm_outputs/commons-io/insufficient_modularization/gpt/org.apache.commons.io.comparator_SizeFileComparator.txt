    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: loc=77, nom=4, wmc=8 and lcom=0.0 (high cohesion). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only a single external dependency (org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils). Although there are 6 fields (nof=6, nopf=4), the low method count and cohesion suggest a single, well-focused responsibility. Given the modest size, moderate complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
