    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.AppendableOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Insufficient modularization not detected: the class is small (LOC=31), low complexity (WMC=3), has few methods (NOM=3), no public fields (NOPF=0), and very high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already concise and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted."
