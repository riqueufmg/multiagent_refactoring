{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ByteArrayOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=81), moderate method count (NOM=12) and complexity (WMC=14), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), no fields reported (NOF=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). These metrics indicate the class is compact and focused, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided data."
