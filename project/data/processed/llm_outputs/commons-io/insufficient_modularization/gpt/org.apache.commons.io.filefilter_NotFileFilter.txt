    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.NotFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive, so it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. Evidence: LOC = 58 (small size), WMC = 6 and NOM = 6 (low complexity and few methods), NOF = 2 (few fields), LCOM = 0.0 (high cohesion), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (low coupling). The single dependency is IOFileFilter. These metrics indicate the class is appropriately focused and does not require further decomposition."
