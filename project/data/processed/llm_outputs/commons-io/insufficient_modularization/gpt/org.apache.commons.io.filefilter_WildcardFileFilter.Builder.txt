    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.WildcardFileFilter.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=49 and WMC=0 indicate low size and complexity. It has only 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods reported (nom=0), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOCase). The cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not suggest fragmentation. Given these metrics and treating the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it has grown large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
