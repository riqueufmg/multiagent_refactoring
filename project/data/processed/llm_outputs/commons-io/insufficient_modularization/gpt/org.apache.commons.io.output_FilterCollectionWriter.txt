    "justification": "The class exposes a large surface and concentrated complexity: number of methods nom=14 with 10 public methods (nopm=10) indicating many responsibilities and a sizable public API; lines of code loc=87 combined with weighted methods complexity wmc=14 indicates non-trivial implementation density that could be reduced by splitting responsibilities; it holds very little state (number of fields nof=2, no public fields nopf=0) while implementing many behaviors, which is a typical sign that behavior should be moved into smaller, focused modules; although LCOM=0.0 does not by itself show poor cohesion, the high method count and WMC justify further decomposition to reduce class size and implementation complexity."
