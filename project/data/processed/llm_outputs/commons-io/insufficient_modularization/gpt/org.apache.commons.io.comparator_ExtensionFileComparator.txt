    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=66, WMC=4, NOM=4, LCOM=0.0. Low inheritance depth (DIT=1) and no reported coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate limited complexity and responsibilities. Although it has multiple fields (NOF=8), overall size and method complexity do not suggest a need for further decomposition."
