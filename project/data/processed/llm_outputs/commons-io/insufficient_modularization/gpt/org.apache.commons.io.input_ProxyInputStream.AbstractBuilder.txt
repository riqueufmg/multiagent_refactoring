    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed large/complex class: nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no measured complexity), nof=1 (one field), loc=30 (small size), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), dependencies count=1. DIT=4 alone does not imply insufficient modularization. Therefore there is no evidence in the provided metrics that this class needs further decomposition."
