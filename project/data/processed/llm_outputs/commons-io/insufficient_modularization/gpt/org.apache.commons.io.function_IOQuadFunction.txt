    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=33, NOM=2, WMC=2 (low complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and only one dependency (IOFunction). Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class."
