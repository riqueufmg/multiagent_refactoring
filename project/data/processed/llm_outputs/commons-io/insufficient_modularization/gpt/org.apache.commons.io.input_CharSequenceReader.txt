    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: loc=197 and nom=14 indicate moderate size, wmc=26 is borderline but not extreme, and LCOM=0.142857 (low) shows high cohesion. The class has 6 fields and 12 public methods, but cohesion and moderate size suggest responsibilities are not overly mixed and further decomposition is not clearly warranted based on the provided data."
