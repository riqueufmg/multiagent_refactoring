    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.UncheckedAppendable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive with no evidence of under-modularization: LOC=29, NOM=4, WMC=4 (low complexity), NC=1 (single constructor), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling/dependencies). These metrics indicate the class is simple and focused, so further decomposition is not warranted."
