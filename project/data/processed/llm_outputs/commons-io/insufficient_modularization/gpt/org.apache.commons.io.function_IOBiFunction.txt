    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=36), few methods (nom=3), low complexity (wmc=3), high cohesion (lcom=-1.0), no inheritance depth (dit=0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These elements suggest the class is already small and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
