    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.RandomAccessFileMode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc=175) and elevated complexity (wmc=24) while exposing a very small public API (nom=12 with nopm=10 → only 2 non-private/public methods). The high number of private methods (10) indicates substantial internal implementation detail that could be extracted into smaller helper/strategy classes. It also has multiple fields (nof=6) supporting that internal state/behavior is spread across many methods. Although cohesion is not extremely low (lcom=0.25), the combination of high internal method count, overall complexity, and small public surface suggests the class could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
