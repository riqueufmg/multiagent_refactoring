    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.TrueFileFilter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High lack of cohesion (LCOM = 0.875) combined with a moderate size and surface area (LOC = 62, NOM = 8, NOPM = 7) and non-trivial complexity (WMC = 8) indicate the class likely contains multiple, weakly related responsibilities and could be further decomposed. The presence of multiple fields (NOF = 4) and a non-zero inheritance depth (DIT = 2) reinforce the chance of mixed responsibilities. These elements together justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
