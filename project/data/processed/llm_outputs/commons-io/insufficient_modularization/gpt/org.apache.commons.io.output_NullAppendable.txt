    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=33, WMC=4, NOM=4 (NOPM=3), NOF=1. Low complexity and low size indicate no need for further decomposition. Coupling is minimal (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) and there is only one field to coordinate, so splitting would not meaningfully reduce implementation complexity. Although LCOM=1.0 can suggest limited field sharing, the overall metric profile (small LOC, few methods, low complexity and dependencies) indicates the class is adequately modular in isolation."
