    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: LOC=128 and NOM=16 show moderate size; WMC=16 indicates moderate complexity but not excessive; LCOM=0.1875 shows high cohesion (methods are related), NOF=2 (few fields) limits internal state, and FANIN=0 / FANOUT=0 indicate low coupling. Although there are 13 public methods (NOPM=13), the high cohesion and moderate complexity suggest the class is not an undivided conglomerate that requires further decomposition. DIT=3 reflects inheritance depth but does not imply poor modularization in isolation."
