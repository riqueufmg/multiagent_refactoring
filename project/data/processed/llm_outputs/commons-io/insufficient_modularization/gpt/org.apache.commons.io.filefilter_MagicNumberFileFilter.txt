    "justification": "LOC = 117 (relatively large for a single class) combined with WMC = 12 and NOM = 7 (all 7 methods are public: NOPM = 7) indicates moderate implementation complexity concentrated in one class. LCOM = 0.571 shows only moderate cohesion, suggesting the class implements multiple responsibilities that could be separated. NOF = 3 and DIT = 3 further indicate state and inherited behavior contributing to complexity. These factors together justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and could benefit from further modularization."
