    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOrigin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class is large by size (loc=614) and exposes many methods (nom=19, nopm=14), other indicators do not support Insufficient Modularization: cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), complexity is moderate (wmc=21), and it has a small number of fields (nof=3). Depth of inheritance is shallow (dit=2) and there is no evidence of excessive coupling in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0). Taken in isolation, these metrics indicate the class is cohesive and not clearly a candidate for further decomposition."
