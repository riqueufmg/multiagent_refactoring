    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.NullOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=45, NOM=4, WMC=4, NOF=2. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and there is a single dependency on org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils. Although LCOM=1.0 suggests methods do not share state, the overall size and low complexity indicate a focused, minimal responsibility (likely simple write/discard operations) rather than an incompletely decomposed class. Given the low method count, low complexity and low coupling, there is no evidence here that further modularization (decomposition) would reduce size or complexity—so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
