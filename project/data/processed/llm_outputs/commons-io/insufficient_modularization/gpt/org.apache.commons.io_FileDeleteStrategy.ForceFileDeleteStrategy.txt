    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileDeleteStrategy.ForceFileDeleteStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: very small size (loc=22), no methods or fields (nom=0, nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), no dependencies, and shallow inheritance (dit=1). These metrics indicate the class is minimal and contains no internal complexity that would justify further decomposition."
