    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=57, NOM=5, WMC=6, NOF=2. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. DIT=1 (shallow inheritance) and no fan-in/fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size and complexity metrics and high cohesion, there is no evidence the class needs further decomposition."
