    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=28, nom=3 methods, nof=1 field, WMC=3 (low complexity). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition (insufficient modularization) is needed."
