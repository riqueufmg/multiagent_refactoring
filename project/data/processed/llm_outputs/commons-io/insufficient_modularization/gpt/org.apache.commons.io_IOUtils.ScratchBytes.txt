    "justification": "In isolation there is no evidence of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=42), zero methods (NOM=0) and zero cyclomatic complexity (WMC=0) indicate a simple data holder. It has only 3 fields (NOF=3), no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion concern calculable). These metrics do not indicate a class that should be further decomposed."
