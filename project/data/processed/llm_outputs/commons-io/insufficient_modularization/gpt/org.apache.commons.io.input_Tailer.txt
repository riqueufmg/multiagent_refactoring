    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class meets multiple indicators of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc=683) and high implementation complexity (wmc=43) with a high method and field count (nom=26, nof=25, nopm=22). It contains several distinct nested types/dependencies (Tailer.Builder, Tailer.Tailable, Tailer.RandomAccessResourceBridge, TailerListener) and interacts with threading and file utilities (org.apache.commons.io.ThreadUtils, IOUtils, FileTimes), which suggests multiple responsibilities bundled in one class. Although cohesion (lcom=0.0) is high, the combination of large LOC, many methods/fields, and multiple embedded roles/nested types indicates the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split into smaller classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
