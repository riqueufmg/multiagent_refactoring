    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.DirectoryWalker",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 261) combined with a high method count (nom = 16) and elevated complexity (wmc = 23) indicate it contains substantial implementation and control logic that could be decomposed. It has no inheritance (dit = 0), suggesting decomposition was not achieved via subclasses, and it declares an inner type (DirectoryWalker.CancelException) and depends on several file-filtering concerns (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter, FileFilterUtils, TrueFileFilter), which points to multiple responsibilities. Although cohesion is relatively high (lcom = 0.125), the absolute size and complexity metrics justify refactoring into smaller, focused classes or components to reduce implementation complexity and improve modularity."
