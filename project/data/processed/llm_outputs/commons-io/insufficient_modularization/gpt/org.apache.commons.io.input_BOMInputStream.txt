    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC=307), high complexity (WMC=33), many methods (NOM=20, of which NOPM=15 public) and a non-trivial number of fields (NOF=11). These metrics indicate significant implementation complexity and multiple responsibilities that could be split into smaller classes or helpers to reduce size and complexity. (Note: LCOM=0.15 indicates good cohesion, but the absolute size/complexity metrics and its use of multiple dependencies [org.apache.commons.io.ByteOrderMark, Builder, IOUtils] still justify considering decomposition.)"
