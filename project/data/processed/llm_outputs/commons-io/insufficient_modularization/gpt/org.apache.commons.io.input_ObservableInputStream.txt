    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ObservableInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class is moderately large (LOC=266) with a fair number of methods (NOM=20, NOPM=11) and moderate complexity (WMC=26), its cohesion is high (LCOM=0.15) and it has low state (NOF=2) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=1 indicates simple inheritance. These metrics indicate the class's responsibilities are cohesive and not clearly separable; further decomposition is unlikely to reduce implementation complexity or improve modularity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
