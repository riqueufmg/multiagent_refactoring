    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.UncheckedIOBaseStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has small size and cohesive structure: LOC=36, NOM=9, WMC=9 but only 1 field (NOF=1) and LCOM=0.0 indicating high cohesion. Low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0) show limited complexity and responsibility in isolation. Given the small LOC, single field, and perfect cohesion, there is insufficient evidence that the class has not been decomposed; further modularization is not warranted based on the provided metrics."
