    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.CanExecuteFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=38, WMC=3, NOM=3. It has a small number of fields (NOF=3, NOPF=2) and methods (NOPM=2) and no recorded incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is simple and not a candidate for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
