    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=40, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0, Fan-in=0, Fan-out=0. There are no methods and no measured internal complexity or coupling that indicate multiple responsibilities or a need for further decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
