    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.TeeReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: moderate size (LOC=109) with a small number of methods (NOM=7) and fields (NOF=2), moderate cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC=12), and very high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and no external coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0) further indicate the class is sufficiently focused and does not require further decomposition."
