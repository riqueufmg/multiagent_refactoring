    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class is small (loc=81) with a modest number of methods (nom=6, nopm=5) and few fields (nof=2). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0) and coupling appears minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although WMC is somewhat elevated (wmc=16), in isolation this suggests some internal complexity but not clear evidence that the class should be decomposed further given its small size, high cohesion, and low coupling."
