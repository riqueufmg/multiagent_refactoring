    "justification": "Class metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large or overly complex class: loc=84 (small size), nom=9 and nopm=8 (moderate method count), wmc=9 (moderate complexity), nof=2/nopf=1 (few fields), lcom=0.444 (reasonable cohesion). fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate no coupling pressure. Given these values, there is insufficient evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
