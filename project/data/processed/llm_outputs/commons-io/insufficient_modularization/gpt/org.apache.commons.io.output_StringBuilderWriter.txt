    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.StringBuilderWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear insufficient modularization: size and complexity are modest (loc=106, nom=12, wmc=14), cohesion is high (lcom=0.25) indicating related responsibilities, and it has a small number of fields (nof=2). Coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics suggest the class is reasonably cohesive and not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
