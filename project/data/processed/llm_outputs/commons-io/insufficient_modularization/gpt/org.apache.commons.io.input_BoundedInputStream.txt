    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BoundedInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 327), high method count (nom = 25 with nopm = 19 public methods), and high complexity (wmc = 29). It also has a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 9) and references a nested Builder (org.apache.commons.io.input.BoundedInputStream.Builder) plus other dependencies, suggesting multiple implementation concerns. Although cohesion is relatively good (lcom = 0.16), the combination of large LOC, many methods (including many public methods) and elevated complexity implies the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
