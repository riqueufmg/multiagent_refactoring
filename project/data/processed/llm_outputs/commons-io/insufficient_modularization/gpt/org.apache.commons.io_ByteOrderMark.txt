    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.ByteOrderMark",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: high size (loc = 178) and high implementation complexity (wmc = 25) combined with a relatively large surface (nom = 10 methods, nof = 9 fields, nopf = 6 public fields, nopm = 9 public methods). These values indicate the class contains substantial code and logic that could be split to reduce size and per-class complexity. Although cohesion metric (lcom = 0.0) and lack of inheritance (dit = 0) do not argue against decomposition, the absolute size and complexity metrics (loc and wmc) justify refactoring into smaller, more focused classes or helper components. Dependency list (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) is small, so internal decomposition is feasible without additional external coupling concerns."
