    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.CopyDirectoryVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc = 117) with a moderate number of methods (nom = 12, nopm = 9), relatively low overall complexity (wmc = 17), high cohesion (lcom = 0.0), and few fields (nof = 3). Depth of inheritance (dit = 3) and minimal external dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.file.PathFilter, org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils) do not by themselves indicate an undecomposed, overly large class. These metrics collectively suggest the class is sufficiently decomposed and does not require further modularization."
