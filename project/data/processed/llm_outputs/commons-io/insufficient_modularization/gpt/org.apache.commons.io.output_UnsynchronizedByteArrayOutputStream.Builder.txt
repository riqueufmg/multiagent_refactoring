    "justification": "Metrics indicate no evidence of insufficient modularization: loc=20 (small class size), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods or complexity to decompose), lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion problem reported), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling suggesting hidden responsibilities). Although dit=4 shows inheritance depth, in isolation there is no large size or high implementation complexity that would require further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
