    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.LockableFileWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and relatively complex: 327 LOC, 22 methods (18 public) and WMC=28 indicate substantial implementation size and control complexity. The high count of public methods suggests multiple responsibilities that could be separated. DIT=0 and NC=0 show no use of inheritance decomposition, and FANIN/FANOUT=0 indicate the class is self-contained rather than split across collaborators. Although LCOM=0.27 shows moderate cohesion, it does not offset the class size/complexity and number of public API points. Dependencies (Builder, FileUtils, AbstractByteArrayOutputStream, Charsets) suggest it handles varied concerns (file locking, writing, stream/byte-array handling, charset issues). Taken together, these elements justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
