    "justification": "Not detected: class is small and reasonably cohesive. Metrics show LOC=113 and NOM=5 (limited size and surface), WMC=6 (low implementation complexity), LCOM=0.4 (acceptable cohesion), NOF=5 but NOPF=0 and NOPM=2 (no excessive public surface), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (low coupling), and only a single listed dependency (Builder). These indicators do not support further decomposition in isolation."
