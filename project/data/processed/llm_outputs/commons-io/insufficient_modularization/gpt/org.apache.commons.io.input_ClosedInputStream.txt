    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ClosedInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=52, NOM=4, WMC=5, NOF=2, NOPM=3. It has no inheritance (DIT=0) and no nested complexity (NC=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and the only listed dependency is org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils. Given the limited size, low cyclomatic complexity and minimal dependencies, there is no evidence from these metrics that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed or requires further modularization."
