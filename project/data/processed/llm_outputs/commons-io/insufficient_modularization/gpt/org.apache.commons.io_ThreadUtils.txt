    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=44, NOM=3 (NOPM=2), WMC=5. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. Given low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no indication that the class needs further decomposition."
