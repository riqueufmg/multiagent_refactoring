    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization detected based on class-internal metrics: high lack of cohesion (lcom = 0.8333) indicates methods are largely unrelated and the class likely has multiple responsibilities; moderate size (loc = 56) with 6 methods (nom = 6) and a non-trivial complexity (wmc = 7) suggests the class contains enough behaviour to benefit from decomposition; there are 3 fields (nof = 3) but methods do not cohesively operate on shared data (high LCOM) which supports splitting into smaller, more focused classes. Fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show the class is isolated in the provided context, so decomposition would not violate provided dependency constraints."
