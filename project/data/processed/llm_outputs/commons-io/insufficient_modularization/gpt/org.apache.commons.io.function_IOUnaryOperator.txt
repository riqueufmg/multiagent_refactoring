    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOUnaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=24, number of methods (nom)=2, weighted method count (wmc)=2 indicating low implementation complexity, and LCOM=-1.0 indicating high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). Given the small size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence here that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
