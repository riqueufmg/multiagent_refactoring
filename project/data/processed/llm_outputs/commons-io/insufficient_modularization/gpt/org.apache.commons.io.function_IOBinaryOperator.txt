    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBinaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=38, NOM=3 and WMC=3 indicate low implementation size and complexity. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show no coupling that suggests splitting responsibilities. DIT=1 is shallow. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
