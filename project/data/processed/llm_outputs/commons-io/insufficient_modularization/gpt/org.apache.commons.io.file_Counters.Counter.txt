    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an unduly large or complex class: LOC = 34 (small), NOM = 0 and NOF = 0 (no methods or fields to further decompose), WMC = 0 (no complexity), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling), LCOM = -1.0 (no meaningful cohesion metric because there are no methods). Given the absence of internal behavior or state to split, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
