    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ObservableInputStream.AbstractBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and not complex: LOC=20, number of methods=0, weighted methods per class (WMC)=0, number of fields small (NOF=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has a single dependency (ProxyInputStream). These metrics indicate no evidence of an undecomposed, large, or complex class that would require further modularization."
