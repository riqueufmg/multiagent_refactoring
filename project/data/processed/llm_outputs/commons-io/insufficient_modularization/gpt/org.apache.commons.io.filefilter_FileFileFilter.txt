    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.FileFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: small size (loc=41), low complexity (wmc=3), few methods (nom=3, nopm=2) and few fields (nof=3). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single listed dependency (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter). Although DIT=3 is moderate, it does not by itself imply a need to further decompose the class. These metrics indicate a compact, focused class rather than a large, complex one that requires further modularization."
