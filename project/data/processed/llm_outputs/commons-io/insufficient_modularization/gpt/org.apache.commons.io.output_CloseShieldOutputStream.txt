    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.CloseShieldOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and simple (LOC=29), has few methods (nom=3, nopm=3), and low cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC=3). Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0). Shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and a single dependency (org.apache.commons.io.output.ClosedOutputStream) indicate simple delegation rather than a need for further decomposition. These elements provide no evidence that the class requires additional modularization."
