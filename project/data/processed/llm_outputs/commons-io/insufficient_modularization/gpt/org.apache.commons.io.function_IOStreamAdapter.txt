    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=15, NOM=3, WMC=3, LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). It has no fields (NOF=0), no external coupling (FANOUT=0, FANIN=0) and only one dependency. With low size and low complexity, there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
