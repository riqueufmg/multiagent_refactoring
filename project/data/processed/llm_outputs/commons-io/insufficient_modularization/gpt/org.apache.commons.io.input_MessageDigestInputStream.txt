    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=102, WMC=3, NOM=3 (NOPM=2). Although LCOM=0.666 shows only moderate cohesion, the size and method complexity are low and there is minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on Builder). These metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
