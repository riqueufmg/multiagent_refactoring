    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: loc=76 and nom=8 show small size and limited surface area; wmc=8 indicates low overall complexity; nof=2 and nopf=1 show few fields; nopm=7 (public methods) is moderate; lcom=0.5 indicates moderate cohesion (not low cohesion that would suggest mixed responsibilities); fanin=0 and fanout=0 and only one dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase) show limited coupling. Based on these values taken in isolation, there is no strong evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
