    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.serialization.FullClassNameMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=16, NOM=2 (NOPM=1), NOF=1, WMC=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and there is no coupling or usage indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). Inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1) and there are no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
