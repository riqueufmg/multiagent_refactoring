    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=14, no methods (nom=0) and very low complexity (WMC=0). It only declares two fields (nof=2) and has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate there is no evidence of a large, monolithic implementation that would benefit from further decomposition."
