    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CloseShieldReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=29, NOM=3, WMC=3, LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). Low complexity and method count, DIT=1, fanin=0, fanout=0 and a single dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.ClosedReader) indicate there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
