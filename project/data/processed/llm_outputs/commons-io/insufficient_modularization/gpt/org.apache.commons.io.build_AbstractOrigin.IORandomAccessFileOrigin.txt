    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and non-complex: LOC=19, WMC=0, nof=0, nom=0, nopm=0. Coupling is nil (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 (no measurable cohesion data) and DIT=0. Given the absence of fields, methods, complexity, or dependencies, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
