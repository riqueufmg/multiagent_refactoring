    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ClosedOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows small size and complexity (loc=49, nom=4, wmc=4, nof=2) and minimal coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0, single dependency: org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). There is no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no children (nc=0). Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion, the overall small footprint and low complexity indicate the class is a small/likely utility-like unit rather than an under-modularized large class. Therefore there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
