    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=40, WMC=5, NOM=5 (NOPM=4), NOF=1 (no public fields), LCOM=0.4. Coupling is minimal (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) and inheritance depth is 0 (DIT=0). Given the low size, low complexity and acceptable cohesion, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed."
