    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC = 159 (moderate size), NOM = 16 and WMC = 18 (method count and complexity are moderate), NOF = 0 (no fields, suggesting a focused, stateless design), DIT = 1 (shallow hierarchy), LCOM = -1.0 (indicates high cohesion). External dependencies are minimal (2). Taken in isolation, there is no strong evidence of excessive size, low cohesion, or high complexity that would warrant decomposition."
