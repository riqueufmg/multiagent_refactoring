    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIntSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=19, number of methods (nom)=2, weighted methods complexity (wmc)=2, and LCOM=-1.0 indicating high cohesion. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single listed dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck). These metrics show low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
