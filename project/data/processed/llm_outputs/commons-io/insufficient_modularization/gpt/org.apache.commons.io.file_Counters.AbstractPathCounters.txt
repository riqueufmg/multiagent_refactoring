    "justification": "Metrics show a small, low-complexity class: LOC=53, number of fields=3, number of methods=0 (nom=0), WMC=0, no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These indicate low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
