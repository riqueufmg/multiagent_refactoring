    "justification": "Class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 29 lines of code (loc=29), which is small and focused. All methods are public (nopm=3), indicating a simple interface. Low WMC (3) suggests minimal complexity. No fields (nof=0) and single inheritance (dit=1) show simple structure. No evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
