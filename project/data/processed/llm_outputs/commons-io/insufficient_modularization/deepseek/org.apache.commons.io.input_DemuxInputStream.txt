    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: only 4 methods (all public), 40 LOC, WMC of 5, and LCOM of 0.5 indicating moderate cohesion. No fields suggest minimal state management. The single dependency is utility-focused. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
