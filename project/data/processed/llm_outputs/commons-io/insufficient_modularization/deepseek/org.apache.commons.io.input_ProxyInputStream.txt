{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ProxyInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19) with 249 lines of code (loc=249) and a weighted method complexity of 21 (wmc=21), indicating substantial size and implementation complexity. The presence of 13 classes (nc=13) suggests internal nested classes that could potentially be decomposed further. The LCOM value of 0.32 indicates moderate cohesion, suggesting methods could be grouped into separate concerns."
