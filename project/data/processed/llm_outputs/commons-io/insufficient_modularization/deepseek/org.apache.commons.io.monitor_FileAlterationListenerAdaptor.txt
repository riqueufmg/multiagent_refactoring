    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 60 LOC and WMC=9, indicating low complexity per method. All methods are public (nopm=9), suggesting a cohesive adapter interface. LCOM=-1.0 shows high cohesion. No fields (nof=0) and minimal dependencies suggest the class is already appropriately modularized."
