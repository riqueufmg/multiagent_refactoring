    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.AbstractByteArrayOutputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: 24 methods (nom=24), 40 weighted methods per class (wmc=40), and 322 lines of code (loc=322). The lack of decomposition is indicated by only 2 classes (nc=2) within the file despite the high method count and size, suggesting further modularization could reduce implementation complexity."
