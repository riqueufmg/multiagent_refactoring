    "justification": "The class has 117 lines of code (loc) and 4 fields (nof), indicating significant size and potential complexity. With 0 methods (nom) and 0 public methods (nopm), all logic is likely implemented elsewhere or within the class without proper method decomposition, suggesting insufficient modularization."
