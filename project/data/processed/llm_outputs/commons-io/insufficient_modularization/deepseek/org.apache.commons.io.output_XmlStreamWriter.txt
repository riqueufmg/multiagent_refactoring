    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.XmlStreamWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) and 193 lines of code (loc=193), indicating substantial size and potential complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=24) suggests moderate to high method complexity. The lack of child classes (nc=0) and direct inheritance (dit=0) combined with a lack of cohesion metric (lcom=0.385) shows some internal grouping that could be separated. The presence of a nested Builder class dependency suggests some modularization exists, but the overall size and method count indicate further decomposition could reduce implementation complexity."
