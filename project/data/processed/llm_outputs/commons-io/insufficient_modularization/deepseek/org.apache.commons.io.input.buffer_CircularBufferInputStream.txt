    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.buffer.CircularBufferInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods with 98 lines of code and a weighted method complexity of 17, indicating moderate size and complexity. The LCOM value of 0.2857 suggests some cohesion issues, and the class depends on CircularByteBuffer which could potentially encapsulate more of the buffer management logic currently implemented in this class."
