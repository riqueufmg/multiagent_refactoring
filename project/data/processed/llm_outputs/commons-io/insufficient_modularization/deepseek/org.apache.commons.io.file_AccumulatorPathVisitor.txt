    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.AccumulatorPathVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19) with 178 lines of code (loc=178) and a weighted method complexity of 22 (wmc=22), indicating substantial implementation complexity. The lack of decomposition is evident from the high method count and lines of code within a single class, suggesting further modularization could reduce its size and complexity."
