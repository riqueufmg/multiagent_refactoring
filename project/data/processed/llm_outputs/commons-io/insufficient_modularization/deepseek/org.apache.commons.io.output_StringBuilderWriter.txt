    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.StringBuilderWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=14, LOC=106, NOM=12) with high cohesion (LCOM=0.25) and no dependencies. All methods are public (NOPM=12), suggesting a focused, single-responsibility wrapper around StringBuilder. No clear indicators of insufficient decomposition."
