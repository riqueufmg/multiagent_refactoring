    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=10, LOC=152), minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), and high cohesion (LCOM=0.6). It primarily defines static final charset constants (nopf=6, nopm=9), indicating it serves a single, well-defined purpose without excessive implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
