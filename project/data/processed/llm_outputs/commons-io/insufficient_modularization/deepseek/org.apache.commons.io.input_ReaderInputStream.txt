    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReaderInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19) with 33 weighted methods per class (wmc=33) and 272 lines of code (loc=272), indicating high implementation complexity. The low LCOM value (0.16) suggests strong method cohesion, but the large method count and code volume exceed typical single-responsibility thresholds, showing insufficient decomposition despite internal cohesion."
