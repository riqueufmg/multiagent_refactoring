    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.UncheckedFilterWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods with 11 public methods, 108 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 12. These metrics indicate moderate size and complexity. The class has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), suggesting it primarily delegates operations. The LCOM value of -1.0 indicates high method cohesion. The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization as it appears focused on a single responsibility of providing unchecked I/O operations."
