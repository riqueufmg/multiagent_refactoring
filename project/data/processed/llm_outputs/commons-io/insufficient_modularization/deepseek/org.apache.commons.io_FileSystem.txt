```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileSystem",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: 29 methods (nom), 433 lines of code (loc), and 41 weighted methods per class (wmc). It has 17 fields (nof) and 17 public methods (nopm), indicating multiple responsibilities. The low LCOM (0.17) suggests high method cohesion, but the overall size and complexity suggest insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
