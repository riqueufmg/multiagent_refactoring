    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ClosedOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields and 4 methods with 49 LOC and WMC of 4, indicating minimal size and complexity. All methods are public, suggesting a focused, single-responsibility design. No further decomposition is warranted as the class is already highly modular."
