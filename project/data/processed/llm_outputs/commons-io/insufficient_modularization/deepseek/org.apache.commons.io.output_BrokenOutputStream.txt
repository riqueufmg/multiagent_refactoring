{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.BrokenOutputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 8 public methods (nopm=8) and 84 lines of code (loc=84), indicating moderate size and complexity. The LCOM value of 0.44 suggests some cohesion but also potential for further decomposition. The class could be split into smaller, more focused units to reduce implementation complexity and improve single responsibility."
