{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedFilterInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) and 134 lines of code (loc=134), indicating substantial size and implementation complexity. The low LCOM value (0.17) suggests high method cohesion, but the class could be decomposed further to reduce its size and complexity, particularly by extracting the Builder dependency into a separate concern."
