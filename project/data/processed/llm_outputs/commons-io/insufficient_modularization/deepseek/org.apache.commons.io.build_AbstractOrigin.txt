    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (614) and WMC (21) are substantial, and it contains 19 methods with only 14 being public, indicating multiple responsibilities. The NC (11) suggests many fields, and the combination of high LOC, WMC, and method count (nom=19) indicates insufficient decomposition despite low LCOM."
