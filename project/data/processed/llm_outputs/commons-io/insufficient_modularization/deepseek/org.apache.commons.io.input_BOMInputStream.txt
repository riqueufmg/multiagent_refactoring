    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BOMInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (307) and WMC (33) are substantial, and it has 20 methods with 15 public methods, indicating a large interface. The LCOM value (0.15) suggests low cohesion, and the class depends on multiple external types, which could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or helper components."
