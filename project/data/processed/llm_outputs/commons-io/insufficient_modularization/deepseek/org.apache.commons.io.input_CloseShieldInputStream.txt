    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CloseShieldInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=38, WMC=4, NOM=4) and minimal dependencies. It shows no signs of insufficient decomposition as it is small, focused on a single responsibility (shielding the underlying stream from close calls), and has no excessive implementation complexity."
