    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.RandomAccessFileMode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=24, LOC=175, LCOM=0.25) with high cohesion and no indication of excessive responsibilities. It has only 6 fields and 12 methods, with 10 being public methods which is reasonable for an enum-like utility class. The dependencies are minimal and focused on I/O operations, suggesting appropriate modularization."
