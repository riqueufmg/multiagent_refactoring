    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.DirectoryWalker",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (261) and WMC (23) are substantial, and it contains 16 methods (nom) with 5 fields (nof), indicating multiple responsibilities. The low LCOM (0.125) suggests high cohesion, but the size and method count imply insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
