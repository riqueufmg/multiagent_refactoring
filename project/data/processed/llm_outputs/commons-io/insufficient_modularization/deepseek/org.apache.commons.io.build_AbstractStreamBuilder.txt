    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: 26 methods (nom), 288 lines of code (loc), 26 weighted methods per class (wmc), and 30 classes in the file (nc). These values indicate the class is large and complex, suggesting it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
