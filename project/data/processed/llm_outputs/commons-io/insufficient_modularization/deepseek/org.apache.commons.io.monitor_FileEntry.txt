```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileEntry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 10 fields and 22 methods with 212 lines of code, indicating high complexity and size. The low LCOM value (0.09) suggests high cohesion, but the large number of methods and fields combined with the absence of inheritance (DIT=0) and dependencies on only three external classes suggests the class may be handling multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
