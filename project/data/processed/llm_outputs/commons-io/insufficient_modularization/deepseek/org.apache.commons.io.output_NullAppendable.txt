    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.NullAppendable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods with 33 LOC and 4 WMC, indicating minimal implementation complexity. It has no fields (nof=1 includes static field), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and serves a single, cohesive purpose as a null Appendable implementation. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
