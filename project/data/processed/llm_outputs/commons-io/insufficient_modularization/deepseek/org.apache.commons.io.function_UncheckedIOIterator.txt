    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=4, LOC=23) and minimal methods (NOM=4, NOPM=3). It has a single field (NOF=1) and no internal classes (NC=0). Dependencies are limited to two external classes, indicating focused responsibility. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
