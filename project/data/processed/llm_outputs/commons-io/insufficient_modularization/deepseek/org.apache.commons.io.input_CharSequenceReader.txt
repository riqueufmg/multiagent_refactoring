```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CharSequenceReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) with 197 lines of code (loc=197) and a weighted method complexity of 26 (wmc=26), indicating significant implementation complexity. The low LCOM value (0.14) suggests high method cohesion, but the size and complexity metrics show the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its responsibilities."
