    "justification": "The class has only 1 field, 10 methods, 116 LOC, and 10 WMC, which are moderate values. It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies beyond utility classes, and its LCOM of -1 indicates high method cohesion. The metrics do not suggest excessive size or complexity requiring further decomposition."
