    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 102 lines of code (loc=102), indicating substantial implementation complexity. While LCOM (0.36) suggests moderate cohesion, the high method count and significant size suggest further decomposition could reduce complexity and improve modularity."
