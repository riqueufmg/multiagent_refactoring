    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.MemoryMappedFileInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) with 6 being public (nopm=6) and a weighted method complexity of 20 (wmc=20), indicating multiple responsibilities. It contains an inner Builder class and depends on utility classes for cleanup operations, suggesting further decomposition could reduce its implementation complexity."
