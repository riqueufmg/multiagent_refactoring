    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), and 45 lines of code (loc=45), which indicates minimal implementation complexity. With no methods to decompose and a single field, further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
