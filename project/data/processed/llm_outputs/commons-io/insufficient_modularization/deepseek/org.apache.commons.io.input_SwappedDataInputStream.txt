    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.SwappedDataInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 public methods (nom=16, nopm=16) and a weighted method complexity of 18 (wmc=18) with 159 lines of code (loc=159), indicating high implementation complexity and size that could be reduced through further decomposition. The lack of fields (nof=0) suggests it may be handling multiple responsibilities through its methods rather than state management."
