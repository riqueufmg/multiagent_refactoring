    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only 7 methods and 68 LOC, which is small. It has no fields (nof=1 indicates only one field, likely a constant), low WMC (7), and inherits from AbstractFileFilter, suggesting it is already decomposed into a focused interface/abstract class role. No evidence of high complexity or size requiring further decomposition."
