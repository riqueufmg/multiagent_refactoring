```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BrokenInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) with 98 lines of code (loc=98) and a weighted method complexity of 11 (wmc=11), indicating moderate size and complexity concentrated in a single class. The low LCOM value (0.36) suggests high method cohesion, but the class could be decomposed to separate the core broken stream behavior from its 9 public methods (nopm=9) and error-throwing logic into smaller, more focused components."
