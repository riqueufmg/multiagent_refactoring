    "justification": "Class has high complexity metrics: LOC (401) and WMC (48) are substantial, indicating large size and many decision points. It has 16 fields and 20 methods, suggesting multiple responsibilities. Low LCOM (0.15) indicates high cohesion, but the overall size and complexity suggest insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
