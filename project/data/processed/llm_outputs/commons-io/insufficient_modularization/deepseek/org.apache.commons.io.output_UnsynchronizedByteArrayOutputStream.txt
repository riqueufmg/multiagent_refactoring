    "justification": "The class has a low LOC (109) and moderate WMC (16) with 14 methods, indicating focused functionality. It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies beyond its own builder and a related input class, suggesting it is already well-modularized. No clear indicators of insufficient decomposition exist."
