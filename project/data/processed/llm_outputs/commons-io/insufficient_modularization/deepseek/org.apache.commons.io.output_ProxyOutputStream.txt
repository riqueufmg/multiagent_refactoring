    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15) with 10 public methods (nopm=10), 188 lines of code (loc=188), and a weighted method complexity of 18 (wmc=18). This indicates a large number of methods and significant implementation complexity that could potentially be reduced through further decomposition."
