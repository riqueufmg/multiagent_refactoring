    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileAlterationMonitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) and 150 lines of code (loc=150), indicating substantial size and potential complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=23) suggests moderate to high method complexity. While LCOM (0.15) shows good cohesion, the combination of size and method count suggests the class could be decomposed to reduce implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
