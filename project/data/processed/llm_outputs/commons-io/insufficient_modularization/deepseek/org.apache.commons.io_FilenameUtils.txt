    "justification": "Class has high complexity metrics: 48 methods (33 public), 928 lines of code, and weighted method complexity of 167. The low LCOM value (0.104) indicates high method cohesion, suggesting many related methods could be grouped into separate helper classes. The class performs multiple responsibilities related to filename manipulation without decomposition into smaller, focused units."
