    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one method (nom=1) and minimal complexity (loc=13, wmc=1). It has no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies. The single public method (nopm=1) suggests the class is already focused on a single responsibility, and further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
