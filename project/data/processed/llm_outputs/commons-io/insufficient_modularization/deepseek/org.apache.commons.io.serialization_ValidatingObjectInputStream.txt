    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods with 11 public methods, 278 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 19. This indicates high implementation complexity and size that could be reduced through further decomposition, such as extracting helper methods or splitting responsibilities into separate classes."
