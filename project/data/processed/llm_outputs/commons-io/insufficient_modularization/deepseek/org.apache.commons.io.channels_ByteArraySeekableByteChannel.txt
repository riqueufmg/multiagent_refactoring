    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.channels.ByteArraySeekableByteChannel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High method count (nom=18) and weighted method complexity (wmc=33) indicate substantial implementation complexity. Low cohesion (lcom=0.1667) suggests multiple responsibilities, while 202 lines of code and 6 fields suggest the class could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
