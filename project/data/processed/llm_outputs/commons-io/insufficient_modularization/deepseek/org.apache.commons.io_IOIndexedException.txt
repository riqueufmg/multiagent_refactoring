    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOIndexedException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=3, LOC=39, NOM=3) and no dependencies, indicating it is already small and focused. LCOM=0 suggests good cohesion, and further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
