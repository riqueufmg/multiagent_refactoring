    "justification": "Class has low complexity metrics: LOC=21, WMC=4, NOM=4, NOF=0. All methods are public (NOPM=4), indicating a focused, minimal interface. No fields suggest no internal state management. Dependencies are minimal (1). Size and implementation complexity are already low, making further decomposition unnecessary."
