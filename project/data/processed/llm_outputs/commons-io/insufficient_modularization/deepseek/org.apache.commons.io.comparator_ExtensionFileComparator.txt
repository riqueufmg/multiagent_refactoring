    "justification": "Class has low complexity metrics (WMC=4, LOC=66, NOM=4) with zero NC and LCOM=0.0, indicating high cohesion. All methods are public (NOPM=4 out of NOM=4), suggesting focused responsibility. Dependencies are minimal and appropriate for its single concern of file extension comparison."
