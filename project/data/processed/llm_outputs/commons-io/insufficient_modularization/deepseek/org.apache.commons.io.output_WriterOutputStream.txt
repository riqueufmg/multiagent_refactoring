    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.WriterOutputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (278) and WMC (26) are substantial, and it has 17 methods with only 13 being public, indicating potential internal helper methods that could be extracted. The LCOM (0.12) suggests low cohesion, and the class depends on multiple external utility classes, which may indicate it handles multiple responsibilities."
