    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ClosedInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=52, WMC=5, NOM=4, NOF=2) and minimal dependencies. It appears to be a small, focused utility class implementing a single, well-defined responsibility (an InputStream that is always closed). Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
