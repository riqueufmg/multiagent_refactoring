    "justification": "The class has high method count (nom=48, nopm=45) and high WMC (48), indicating significant implementation complexity that could be reduced through decomposition. The low LCOM (0.0625) suggests high method cohesion, but the large number of methods and lines of code (loc=151) exceed typical single-responsibility thresholds."
