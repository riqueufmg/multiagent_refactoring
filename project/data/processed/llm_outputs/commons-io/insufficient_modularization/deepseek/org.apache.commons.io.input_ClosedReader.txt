    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ClosedReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has minimal complexity with only 3 methods, 38 LOC, and 4 WMC. All methods are public, indicating a focused single responsibility. No dependencies suggest it's already a minimal, self-contained unit. Further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
