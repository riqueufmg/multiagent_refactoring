{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ProxyReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) with 184 lines of code (loc=184) and a weighted method count of 14 (wmc=14), indicating substantial implementation complexity. The lack of decomposition is evidenced by 0 fields (nof=0) and 0 public fields (nopf=0), suggesting all behavior is concentrated in methods without clear data separation. The negative LCOM value (-1.0) indicates high method coupling, further supporting that the class performs multiple responsibilities without proper modularization."
