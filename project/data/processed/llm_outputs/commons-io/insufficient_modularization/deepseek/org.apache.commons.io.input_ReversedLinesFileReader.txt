    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReversedLinesFileReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics (LOC: 375, WMC: 34, NOF: 17, NOM: 18) and contains an inner class FilePart that suggests further decomposition could reduce size and complexity. The LCOM value of 0.167 indicates moderate cohesion, supporting that responsibilities could be better separated."
