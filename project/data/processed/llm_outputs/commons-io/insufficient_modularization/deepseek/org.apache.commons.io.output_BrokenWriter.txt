    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.BrokenWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=8, LOC=76, NOM=8) and no indication of excessive responsibilities. It has only one external dependency and shows moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.5). The current modularization appears sufficient for its purpose."
