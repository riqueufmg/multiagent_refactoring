    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.WildcardFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=9, LOC=76, NOM=6) and inherits from AbstractFileFilter, delegating core functionality. It shows good cohesion (LCOM=0.0) and no indication of multiple responsibilities that would require further decomposition."
