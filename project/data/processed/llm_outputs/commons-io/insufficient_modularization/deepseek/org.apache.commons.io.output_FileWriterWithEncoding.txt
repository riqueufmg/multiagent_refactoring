    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) and 242 lines of code (loc=242), indicating substantial size and implementation complexity. The moderate LCOM value (0.5) suggests some cohesion issues, and the presence of an inner Builder class as a dependency hints at internal complexity that could be further decomposed."
