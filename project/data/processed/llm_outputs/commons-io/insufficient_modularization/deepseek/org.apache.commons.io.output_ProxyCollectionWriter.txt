{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ProxyCollectionWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15) with 202 lines of code (loc=202) and a weighted method count of 15 (wmc=15), indicating high implementation complexity. The lack of decomposition is evidenced by having only one class (nc=1) despite the substantial method count and size, suggesting insufficient modularization."
