    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.LockableFileWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: 22 methods (nom), 327 lines of code (loc), and 28 weighted methods per class (wmc). These values indicate the class is large and complex, suggesting it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
