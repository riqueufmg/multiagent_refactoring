    "justification": "The class has 7 methods and 309 lines of code, indicating substantial size. It contains 4 inner classes as dependencies, suggesting it aggregates multiple responsibilities. The LCOM value of 0.857 suggests low cohesion, meaning the class likely handles multiple unrelated concerns that could be separated."
