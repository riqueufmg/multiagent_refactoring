    "justification": "The class has only 1 method and 41 LOC, with 7 fields that appear to be constants. It has no internal complexity (WMC=1, LCOM=0), minimal dependencies (all external types), and serves as a simple constants holder. Further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
