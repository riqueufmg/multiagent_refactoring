{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileCleaningTracker",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 204 lines of code (loc=204), indicating substantial size. It contains an inner class (Reaper) and depends on FileDeleteStrategy, suggesting multiple responsibilities. The LCOM value (0.36) shows moderate cohesion, and the WMC (14) indicates moderate complexity, both suggesting potential for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
