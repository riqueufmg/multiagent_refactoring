    "justification": "Class has moderate size (128 LOC, 16 methods) with low complexity (WMC=16, LCOM=0.1875 indicating good cohesion). It inherits from AbstractFileFilter and implements IOFileFilter, leveraging existing modularization. No excessive dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no indication that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
