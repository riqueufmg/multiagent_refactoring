    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=88, WMC=9, NOM=9) with no fields (NOF=0) and minimal dependencies. It shows high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0) and all methods are public (NOPM=8 out of NOM=9), indicating it already serves a single, well-defined purpose without excessive implementation complexity."
