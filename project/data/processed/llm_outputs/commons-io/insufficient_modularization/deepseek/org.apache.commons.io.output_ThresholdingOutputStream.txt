    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ThresholdingOutputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) with 10 public methods (nopm=10), 176 lines of code (loc=176), and a weighted method complexity of 17 (wmc=17). This indicates a substantial size and implementation complexity that could potentially be reduced through further decomposition, such as extracting helper methods or separating concerns into smaller, more focused classes."
