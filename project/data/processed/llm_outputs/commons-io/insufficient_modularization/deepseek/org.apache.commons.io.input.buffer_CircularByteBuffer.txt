    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) and 196 lines of code (loc=196), indicating substantial implementation complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=34) is high, suggesting complex methods. With 4 fields (nof=4) and low cohesion (lcom=0.15), the class handles multiple responsibilities within a single unit, demonstrating insufficient decomposition."
