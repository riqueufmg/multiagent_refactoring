    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field, 0 methods, and 123 lines of code. While LOC is moderately high, the lack of methods (WMC=0) and minimal complexity metrics do not indicate a class that would benefit from further decomposition. The single dependency is minimal."
