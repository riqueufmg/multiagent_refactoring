"justification": "org.apache.commons.io.charset has Ce=0 and Ca=2 => stability I=2/(2+0)=1.0 (very stable). It has no outgoing dependencies (does not depend on other packages) and two incoming dependencies: org.apache.commons.io.input (Ce=7, Ca=3 => I=3/10=0.3) and org.apache.commons.io.output (Ce=6, Ca=4 => I=4/10=0.4). Those less-stable packages depend on this more-stable package, which follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore there is no Unstable Dependency smell for this package."
