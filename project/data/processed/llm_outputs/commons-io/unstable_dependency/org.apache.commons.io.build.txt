"package": "org.apache.commons.io.build",
"detection": true,
"justification": "org.apache.commons.io.build has Ce=4, Ca=2 -> instability I = 4/(4+2) = 0.667. One of its outgoing dependencies, org.apache.commons.io.input, has Ce=7, Ca=3 -> I = 7/(7+3) = 0.700, which is less stable (higher instability) than org.apache.commons.io.build. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle (a package should depend only on more stable packages). Other outgoing dependencies are more stable (org.apache.commons.io.file I=0.417, org.apache.commons.io.function I=0.222, org.apache.commons.io I=0.353). Note also org.apache.commons.io.input lists org.apache.commons.io.build among its dependencies (cyclic dependency), which further exacerbates the unstable dependency issue."
