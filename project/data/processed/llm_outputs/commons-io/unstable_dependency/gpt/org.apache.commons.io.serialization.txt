"justification": "The analyzed package has Ce=1 and Ca=0 (instability I = 0.0). Its only outgoing dependency is org.apache.commons.io which has Ce=6 and Ca=11 (instability I ≈ 0.647). Since the package depends on a more stable package (0.647 > 0.0), the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and there is no Unstable Dependency smell. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies to the analyzed package."
