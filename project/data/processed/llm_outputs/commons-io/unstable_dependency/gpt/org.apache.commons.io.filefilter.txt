"detection": true,
"justification": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter has Ce=4 and Ca=3 -> instability I = 4/(4+3) = 0.571. One of its outgoing dependencies, org.apache.commons.io.output, has Ce=6 and Ca=4 -> I = 6/(6+4) = 0.600, which is less stable (higher instability) than org.apache.commons.io.filefilter. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle (a package should only depend on packages more stable than itself), so an unstable dependency is detected. Other outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.file I=0.417, org.apache.commons.io.function I=0.222, org.apache.commons.io I=0.353) are more stable and do not violate the principle. Incoming dependencies include org.apache.commons.io (I=0.353), org.apache.commons.io.file (I=0.417) and org.apache.commons.io.monitor (Ce=5,Ca=0 -> I=1.0), but the outgoing dependency to org.apache.commons.io.output is sufficient to mark this package as having an unstable dependency."
