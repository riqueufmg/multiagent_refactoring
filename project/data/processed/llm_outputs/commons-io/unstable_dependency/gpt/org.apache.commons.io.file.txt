"justification": "Analyzed package org.apache.commons.io.file has Ce=5, Ca=7 -> instability I = 5/(5+7) = 0.4167. It has outgoing dependencies to: org.apache.commons.io.filefilter (Ce=4, Ca=3 -> I=4/7 = 0.5714) and org.apache.commons.io.output (Ce=6, Ca=4 -> I=6/10 = 0.6000), both of which are less stable (higher I) than org.apache.commons.io.file. Depending on these more unstable packages violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, so an Unstable Dependency smell is detected. Other outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io I=0.3529, org.apache.commons.io.file.attribute I=0.0000, org.apache.commons.io.function I=0.2222) are more stable and do not cause the violation."
