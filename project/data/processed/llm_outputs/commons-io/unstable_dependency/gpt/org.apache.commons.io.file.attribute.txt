"justification": "The package has Ce=0 and Ca=4 giving stability I = 1.0 (very stable). It has no outgoing dependencies. Incoming dependencies come from org.apache.commons.io (I≈0.647), org.apache.commons.io.input (I=0.3), org.apache.commons.io.file (I≈0.583) and org.apache.commons.io.monitor (I=0.0). Because the package does not depend on less stable packages (it has no efferent couplings) and is more stable than its dependents, the Stable Dependency Principle is satisfied and no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
