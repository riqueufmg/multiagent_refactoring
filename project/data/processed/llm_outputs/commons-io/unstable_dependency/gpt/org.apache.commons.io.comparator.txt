Since the analyzed package depends on org.apache.commons.io which has lower instability (more stable) than org.apache.commons.io.comparator, the dependency direction follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. There is an incoming dependency from org.apache.commons.io.monitor (Ce=5, Ca=0 -> I=1.0, unstable) but it is an incoming dependency (other package depends on org.apache.commons.io.comparator) and does not constitute an unstable dependency of this package. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
