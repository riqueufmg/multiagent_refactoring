  "justification": "Analyzed package org.apache.commons.io.input.buffer has Ce=1 and Ca=0, giving instability I = 0/(0+1) = 0. Its sole outgoing dependency is org.apache.commons.io which has Ce=6 and Ca=11, giving instability I = 11/(11+6) ≈ 0.647. Because the analyzed package (I=0) depends on a more stable package (I≈0.647) and there are no incoming dependencies (Ca=0), the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated; therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
