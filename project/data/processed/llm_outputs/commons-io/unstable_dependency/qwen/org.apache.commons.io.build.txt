"package": "org.apache.commons.io.build",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.io.build has outgoing dependencies on packages that are more stable (higher Ca and lower Ce). Specifically, it depends on org.apache.commons.io (Ca=11, Ce=6), org.apache.commons.io.file (Ca=7, Ce=5), org.apache.commons.io.function (Ca=7, Ce=2), and org.apache.commons.io.input (Ca=3, Ce=7). Although org.apache.commons.io.input has a higher Ce, its Ca is lower than the analyzed package, making it more stable. Therefore, all dependencies follow the Stable Dependencies Principle."
