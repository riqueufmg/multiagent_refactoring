"package": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.apache.commons.io.monitor' has a stability value (I) of 1.0, indicating it is completely unstable. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, unstable packages can depend on other packages regardless of their stability. Therefore, even though it depends on packages like 'org.apache.commons.io' (I = 0.35) and 'org.apache.commons.io.file' (I = 0.42), which are more stable, this does not constitute an unstable dependency smell because the principle allows unstable packages to depend on more stable ones."
