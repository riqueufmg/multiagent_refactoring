```json
{
"package": "org.apache.commons.io.input",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'org.apache.commons.io.input' has outgoing dependencies to packages that are less stable than itself. Stability is determined by the ratio of Ca/(Ca+Ce). For 'org.apache.commons.io.input', the stability is 3/(3+7) = 0.3. Its dependency 'org.apache.commons.io.build' has stability 2/(2+4) = 0.33, which is higher (more stable), but 'org.apache.commons.io.output' has stability 4/(4+6) = 0.4, also more stable. However, 'org.apache.commons.io' has stability 11/(11+6) ≈ 0.65, which is more stable. But according to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should only depend on packages that are MORE stable. Here, 'org.apache.commons.io.input' (stability=0.3) depends on 'org.apache.commons.io.build' (stability=0.33) and 'org.apache.commons.io.output' (stability=0.4), both of which have higher stability values (i.e., more stable), so it does NOT violate the principle with respect to these. Re-evaluating strictly: 'org.apache.commons.io.input' depends on ['org.apache.commons.io', 'org.apache.commons.io.charset', 'org.apache.commons.io.file', 'org.apache.commons.io.function', 'org.apache.commons.io.build', 'org.apache.commons.io.file.attribute', 'org.apache.commons.io.output']. Their stabilities are: 'org.apache.commons.io': 11/17≈0.65, 'org.apache.commons.io.charset': 2/2=1.0, 'org.apache.commons.io.file': 7/12≈0.58, 'org.apache.commons.io.function': 7/9≈0.78, 'org.apache.commons.io.build': 2/6≈0.33, 'org.apache.commons.io.file.attribute': 4/4=1.0, 'org.apache.commons.io.output': 4/10=0.4. The stability of 'org.apache.commons.io.input' is 3/10=0.3. It depends on 'org.apache.commons.io.build' (0.33) and 'org.apache.commons.io.output' (0.4), which are both more stable (higher stability value). Therefore, there is NO unstable dependency. Correction: Detection should be FALSE."

Correction based on accurate calculation:

```json
{
"package": "org.apache.commons.io.input",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.apache.commons.io.input' has a stability of 3/(3+7) = 0.3. Its outgoing dependencies include packages such as 'org.apache.commons.io.build' (stability = 2/(2+4) = 0.33), 'org.apache.commons.io.output' (stability = 4/(4+6) = 0.4), 'org.apache.commons.io' (stability = 11/(11+6) ≈ 0.65), and others. All of these dependencies have a stability greater than or equal to 0.3, meaning they are equally or more stable. Thus, 'org.apache.commons.io.input' adheres to the Stable Dependencies Principle by depending only on packages that are as stable or more stable than itself."
