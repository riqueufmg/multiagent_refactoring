"package": "org.apache.commons.io.function",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.apache.commons.io.function' has outgoing dependencies on 'org.apache.commons.io.file' and 'org.apache.commons.io'. Both of these packages have higher stability (more classes, larger LOC, higher Ca) than the analyzed package, which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle. Hence, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
