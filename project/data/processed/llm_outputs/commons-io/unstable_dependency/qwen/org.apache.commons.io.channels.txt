"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.io.channels has outgoing dependencies on org.apache.commons.io and org.apache.commons.io.function. To evaluate stability, we calculate the instability metric (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)) for each package. org.apache.commons.io.channels has I = 2/(0+2) = 1.0 (completely unstable). org.apache.commons.io has I = 6/(11+6) = 0.35 (more stable). org.apache.commons.io.function has I = 2/(7+2) = 0.22 (more stable). Since org.apache.commons.io.channels (unstable) depends on packages that are more stable than itself, this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not constitute an Unstable Dependency smell."
