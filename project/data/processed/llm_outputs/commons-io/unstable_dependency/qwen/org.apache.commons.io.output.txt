{
"package": "org.apache.commons.io.output",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'org.apache.commons.io.output' depends on packages that are less stable than itself. Specifically, it depends on 'org.apache.commons.io.input' (instability = 0.7), which has higher instability than 'org.apache.commons.io.output' (instability = 0.6). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable (i.e., have lower instability) than itself."
