{
"package": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.apache.commons.io.filefilter' has a stability value of 0.57 (Ce=4, Ca=3). Its outgoing dependencies are to packages with stability values of 0.42 ('org.apache.commons.io.file'), 0.35 ('org.apache.commons.io'), 0.22 ('org.apache.commons.io.function'), and 0.6 ('org.apache.commons.io.output'). All dependencies except 'org.apache.commons.io.output' are to more stable packages. However, 'org.apache.commons.io.output' is less stable than 'org.apache.commons.io.filefilter', which violates the Stable Dependencies Principle. But since the majority of its dependencies are to more stable packages, and considering the overall architectural context, it does not constitute an unstable dependency smell."
