"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.io.input.buffer has stability of 1.0 (Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 1/(1+0) = 1.0) since it has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0) and 1 outgoing dependency (Ce=1). It depends on org.apache.commons.io which has stability of 0.35 (Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 6/(6+11) = 0.35). Since the dependent package (org.apache.commons.io) is less stable than the analyzed package (org.apache.commons.io.input.buffer), this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle - more stable packages depend on less stable ones. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
