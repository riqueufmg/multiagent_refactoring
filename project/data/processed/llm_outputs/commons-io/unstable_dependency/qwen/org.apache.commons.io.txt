"package": "org.apache.commons.io",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'org.apache.commons.io' has outgoing dependencies to packages 'org.apache.commons.io.file', 'org.apache.commons.io.function', 'org.apache.commons.io.input', 'org.apache.commons.io.filefilter', 'org.apache.commons.io.file.attribute', and 'org.apache.commons.io.output'. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we must check if any of these dependencies are less stable (i.e., have a higher instability value) than 'org.apache.commons.io'. However, since all outgoing dependencies are internal to the same library and part of a cohesive module structure, and without explicit instability metrics (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) provided for each package, we cannot definitively conclude that any dependency is less stable. Therefore, based on available data and typical modular design principles within the same library, no unstable dependency smell is detected."
