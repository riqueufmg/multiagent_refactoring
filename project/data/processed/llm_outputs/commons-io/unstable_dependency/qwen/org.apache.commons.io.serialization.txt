"package": "org.apache.commons.io.serialization",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.apache.commons.io.serialization has stability of 0.167 (Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 1/(0+1)) and depends on org.apache.commons.io which has stability of 0.353 (Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 6/(11+6)). Since the dependent package (0.353) is more stable than the analyzed package (0.167), this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not constitute an Unstable Dependency smell."
