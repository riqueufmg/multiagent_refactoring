Outgoing dependencies: org.apache.commons.io.function (Ce=2, Ca=7 -> I = 2/(2+7) = 0.222), org.apache.commons.io (Ce=6, Ca=11 -> I = 6/(6+11) = 0.353). Both outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than the analyzed package. There are no incoming dependencies (Ca=0). Because the package depends only on more stable packages, it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
