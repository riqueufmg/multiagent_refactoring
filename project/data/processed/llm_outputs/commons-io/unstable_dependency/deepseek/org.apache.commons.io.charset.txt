  "justification": "The package has Ce=0 (no outgoing dependencies), implying it does not depend on any less stable packages. Its Ca=2 indicates it has incoming dependencies, and it has a stability index (I=Ce/(Ca+Ce)=0) of 0, which is maximally stable. Therefore, no violation of the Stable Dependencies Principle is present."
