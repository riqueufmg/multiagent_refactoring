    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes and 947 lines of code, which is a moderate size. The largest class, FileAlterationObserver, has 375 lines and 29 methods, but it is not excessively large. The classes are cohesive and focused on file monitoring responsibilities, and the package does not exhibit signs of excessive size or complexity that would characterize a God Component."
