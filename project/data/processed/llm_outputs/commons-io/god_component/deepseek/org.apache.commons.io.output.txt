    "justification": "Package contains 52 classes with 4700 total LOC, making it excessively large. The class list shows many classes with high LOC and complexity metrics (e.g., AbstractByteArrayOutputStream: 322 LOC, 24 methods; LockableFileWriter: 327 LOC, 22 methods), indicating the package has grown beyond a cohesive unit of responsibility."
