    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.output",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a very large number of classes (52) and a high total size (≈4700 LOC), indicating an excessive component size. Several classes are individually large and complex (examples: AbstractByteArrayOutputStream loc=322 wmc=40, LockableFileWriter loc=327 wmc=28, DeferredFileOutputStream loc=322 wmc=25, WriterOutputStream loc=278 wmc=26, ProxyWriter loc=194, XmlStreamWriter loc=193), showing concentrated complexity and multiple responsibilities. The presence of many builder/nested types and many medium-to-large utility classes in the same package suggests the package is doing too much and would benefit from decomposition. These elements support detecting a God Component smell for org.apache.commons.io.output."
