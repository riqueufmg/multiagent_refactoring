    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 29 classes and 3,723 LOC, indicating a large component. Code is heavily concentrated in a few very large classes: PathUtils alone is 1,516 LOC with 109 methods and WMC 158 (≈40.7% of package LOC), FilesUncheck is 563 LOC, Counters is 309 LOC, CountingPathVisitor is 226 LOC and AccumulatorPathVisitor 178 LOC. Several classes contain many nested/inner types (e.g., Counters, PathUtils), and large method counts/complexities (nom/WMC) further concentrate responsibility. This size and concentration of functionality justify identifying the package as a God Component."
