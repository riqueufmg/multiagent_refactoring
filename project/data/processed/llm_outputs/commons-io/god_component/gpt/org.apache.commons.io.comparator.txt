    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes and 490 LOC (avg ~49 LOC/class), which is moderate rather than excessive. No single class dominates the LOC (largest is 77 LOC). Class-level complexity metrics (wmc generally 2–8, nom small) and cohesion (lcom values low) are low, and fanin/fanout are zero for listed classes. Afferent/efferent couplings (Ca=1, Ce=2) are minimal. Based on these metrics and the lack of a very large or highly complex class, there is insufficient evidence to classify this package as a God Component."
