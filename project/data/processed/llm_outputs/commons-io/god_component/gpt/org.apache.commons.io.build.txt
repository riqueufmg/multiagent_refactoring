    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.build",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 17 classes and 1,633 LOC with a strong concentration of size and complexity in a few classes: AbstractOrigin (614 LOC, wmc 21), AbstractStreamBuilder (288 LOC, wmc 26) and AbstractOriginSupplier (283 LOC, wmc 34) — these three account for ~72% of the package LOC. AbstractOrigin also defines many nested origin types within a single file, indicating multiple responsibilities collocated. The high LOC and weighted methods per class values combined with multiple cohesive responsibilities suggest the package is excessively large and acting as a God Component."
