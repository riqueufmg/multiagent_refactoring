    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes and 947 LOC, which is moderate for a focused monitoring package and not excessive in number of classes. The size is concentrated in two classes (FileAlterationObserver: 375 LOC, WMC 45, 29 methods; FileEntry: 212 LOC) while the other classes are small (LOC 47–150). There are no incoming dependencies (Ca = 0) and the package has limited external coupling (Ce = 6). Although FileAlterationObserver shows high complexity and could be a candidate for class-level refactoring (god class), the package as a whole does not present an excessive size in LOC or class count to qualify as a God Component."
