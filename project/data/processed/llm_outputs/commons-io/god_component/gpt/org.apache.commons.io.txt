    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 9,478 LOC across 40 classes with a highly skewed distribution: IOUtils (2,487 LOC, 172 methods, WMC 275) and FileUtils (2,371 LOC, 159 methods, WMC 244) alone account for roughly half of the package size. Several other large classes (FilenameUtils 928 LOC, FileSystem 433 LOC, EndianUtils 355 LOC, DirectoryWalker 261 LOC) further concentrate functionality. The very high LOC, large numbers of methods and high complexity (WMC) in a few classes indicate excessive responsibilities concentrated in single components, supporting the detection of a God Component at the package level."
