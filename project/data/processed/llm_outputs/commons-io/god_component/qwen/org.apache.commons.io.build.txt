    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 17 classes with a total of 1633 lines of code, which is not excessively large for a package. The largest class, AbstractOrigin, has 614 lines of code and 19 methods, which is substantial but not excessively so given its role as an abstract base class with multiple inner classes. The classes appear to be well-organized around the builder pattern and file I/O abstractions, with reasonable separation of concerns. No single class dominates the package in terms of complexity or responsibility."
