    "detection": false,
    "justification": "While the package contains a large number of classes (40) and significant lines of code (9478), the presence of multiple cohesive and logically grouped classes such as IOUtils, FileUtils, FilenameUtils, and others indicates a well-organized library structure rather than a single God Component. The responsibilities are distributed across specialized classes, each handling distinct aspects of I/O operations."
