    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with a total of 947 lines of code. The largest class, FileAlterationObserver, has 375 lines of code and 29 methods, which is substantial but not excessively large given its role as an observer in the file monitoring system. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable across the classes, with no single class dominating the functionality or LOC disproportionately. The package does not exhibit characteristics of a God Component as the size and complexity are contextually appropriate for its functionality."
