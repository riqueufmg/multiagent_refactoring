    "justification": "The package contains 32 classes with a total of 2709 lines of code. While the package has a considerable number of classes, they are cohesive and focused on file filtering functionality. The largest class, FileFilterUtils, has 469 lines of code and 43 methods, which is substantial but not excessive given its utility role. Classes are well-distributed in terms of responsibilities, and there is no single class that dominates the package in terms of complexity or lines of code disproportionately."
