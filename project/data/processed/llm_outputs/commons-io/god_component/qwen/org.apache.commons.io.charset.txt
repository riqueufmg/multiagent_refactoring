    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a total of 48 lines of code, which is not excessively large. Each class has a low number of methods and lines of code (CharsetEncoders: 3 methods, 29 LOC; CharsetDecoders: 2 methods, 19 LOC). There are no signs of excessive complexity or centralization of functionality that would indicate a God Component."
