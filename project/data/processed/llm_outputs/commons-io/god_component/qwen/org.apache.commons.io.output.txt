    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 52 classes with a total of 4700 lines of code. While the number of classes and LOC is relatively high, the classes are well-organized into cohesive units with clear responsibilities (e.g., OutputStream and Writer implementations). The average LOC per class is around 90, which is not excessively large. There is no single class or component that dominates the package in terms of complexity or functionality, indicating a reasonable distribution of responsibilities."
