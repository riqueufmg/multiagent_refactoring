    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.file",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 29 classes with a total of 3723 lines of code. While the package has a substantial size, the classes are functionally cohesive and focused on file and path operations. The largest class, PathUtils, has 1516 lines of code and 109 methods, which is significant but not excessively large in the context of its utility and responsibilities. Other classes are much smaller and well-scoped. The package does not exhibit the characteristics of a God Component as it maintains reasonable modularity and separation of concerns."
