    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 34 classes with a total of 2198 lines of code. While the number of classes is relatively high, the lines of code are distributed across many small, focused classes (e.g., most classes have fewer than 100 LOC). Key classes like IOStream (394 LOC) and Uncheck (342 LOC) are large but still within reasonable limits for their functionality. The package appears to be a well-organized functional programming utility module rather than a single excessively large component."
