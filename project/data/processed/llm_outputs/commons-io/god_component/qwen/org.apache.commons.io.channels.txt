    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes with a total of 458 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, ByteArraySeekableByteChannel, has 202 lines of code and 18 methods, which is substantial but not unreasonable for a single class. The overall complexity and size of the package and its classes are within acceptable limits for typical software components."
