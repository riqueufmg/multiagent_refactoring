    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 101 classes with a total of 10,353 lines of code. While this is a large package, the classes are well-organized into distinct functional units, each handling specific input stream or reader responsibilities. The largest classes (e.g., ObservableInputStream with 266 LOC, XmlStreamReader with 541 LOC) remain within reasonable complexity bounds. There is no single class or component that dominates the package in terms of size or responsibility, indicating good distribution of functionality."
