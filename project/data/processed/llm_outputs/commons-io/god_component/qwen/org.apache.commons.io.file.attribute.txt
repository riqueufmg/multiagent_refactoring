    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class (FileTimes) with 225 lines of code. While the class has 24 methods and a WMC of 26, the size is not excessive for a single-purpose utility class in the context of file attribute operations. The package structure is simple and focused, without indication of taking on responsibilities beyond its designated scope."
