    "justification": "DeletingPathVisitor has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters, org.apache.commons.io.file.StandardDeleteOption, org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies, the class does not meet the hub-like criteria."
