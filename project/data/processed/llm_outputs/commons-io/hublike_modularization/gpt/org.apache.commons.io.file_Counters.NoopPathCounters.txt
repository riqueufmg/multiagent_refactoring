    "justification": "No hub-like modularization: the class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []), and only a single incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters). A hub requires dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
