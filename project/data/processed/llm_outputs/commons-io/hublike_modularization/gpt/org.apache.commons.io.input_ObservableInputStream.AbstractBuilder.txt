    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.ProxyInputStream) and only one incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.ObservableInputStream). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing links to many other abstractions; here both counts are minimal (1 each), so the smell is not detected."
