    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IOTriConsumer has a single outgoing dependency: org.apache.commons.io.function.Constants. It has incoming dependencies from two classes: org.apache.commons.io.function.Constants and org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck. The total number of distinct other abstractions interacting with IOTriConsumer is small (2), so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions."
