    "justification": "WildcardFilter has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.AbstractFileFilter, org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils, org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; the provided data shows no incoming dependencies and only a small number of outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
