    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ProxyOutputStream has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies: org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils and org.apache.commons.io.output.ProxyOutputStream.Builder. Although org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils itself lists many dependencies (Charsets, StringBuilderWriter, ScratchChars, NullOutputStream, IOTriFunction, StandardLineSeparator, UnsynchronizedByteArrayOutputStream, ByteArrayOutputStream, IOSupplier, NullWriter, ScratchBytes, IOExceptionList, BoundedInputStream, IOConsumer, LineIterator, QueueInputStream, CharSequenceReader), the definition of Hub-like Modularization requires the analyzed abstraction itself to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because ProxyOutputStream lacks incoming dependencies and has only two outgoing links, the Hub-like Modularization smell is not detected."
