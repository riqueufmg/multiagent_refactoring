    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.SuffixFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SuffixFileFilter has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.IOCase, org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils) and a single incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils). These counts are small and do not indicate an abstraction with dependencies to a large number of other abstractions. Note: PathUtils itself lists many dependencies, but those are transitive (dependencies of an outgoing dependency) and not direct incoming/outgoing relationships of SuffixFileFilter."
