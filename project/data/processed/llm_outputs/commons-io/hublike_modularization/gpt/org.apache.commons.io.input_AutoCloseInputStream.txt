    "justification": "AutoCloseInputStream has only outgoing dependencies to two classes (org.apache.commons.io.input.AutoCloseInputStream.Builder and org.apache.commons.io.input.ClosedInputStream) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not meet that criterion."
