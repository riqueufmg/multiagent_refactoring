    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.input.AutoCloseInputStream). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing links). With a single incoming link and no outgoing links, this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
