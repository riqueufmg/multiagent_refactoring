    "justification": "SerializableFileTime has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.file.attribute.FileTimes) and 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileEntry), i.e., links with 2 distinct abstractions. This is a small number of bi-directional dependencies and does not meet the \"large number of other abstractions\" criterion for Hub-like Modularization."
