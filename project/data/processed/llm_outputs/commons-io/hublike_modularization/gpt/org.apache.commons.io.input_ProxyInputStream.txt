    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ProxyInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ProxyInputStream has a modest number of connections: 5 incoming dependents (ObservableInputStream, ObservableInputStream.AbstractBuilder, BoundedInputStream, BoundedInputStream.AbstractBuilder, CountingInputStream) and 4 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIntConsumer, org.apache.commons.io.input.Input, ProxyInputStream.AbstractBuilder, org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). The incoming dependents are primarily closely related input-stream variants and builders within the same package, and the outgoing dependencies are limited and include a utility class and related interfaces/inner builder. The counts and the tight, domain-local nature of the relationships do not indicate a hub-like abstraction with an unusually large number of both incoming and outgoing ties."
