    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has only one outgoing dependency: org.apache.commons.io.input.TailerListener, and only one incoming dependency entry: org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer (among that class's own dependencies). With only 1 incoming and 1 outgoing related abstraction, the condition for a hub-like module (many incoming and outgoing dependencies) is not met."
