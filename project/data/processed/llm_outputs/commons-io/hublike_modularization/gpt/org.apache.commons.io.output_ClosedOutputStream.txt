    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ClosedOutputStream has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and one incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.output.CloseShieldOutputStream). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; ClosedOutputStream's direct dependency count is minimal, so it does not qualify."
