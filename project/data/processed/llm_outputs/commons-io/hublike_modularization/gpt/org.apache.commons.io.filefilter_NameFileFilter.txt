    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.NameFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.IOCase and org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition. Note: although PathUtils (one outgoing dependency) itself depends on many classes, those are not direct incoming/outgoing relationships of NameFileFilter when analyzed in isolation."
