    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies (MemoryMappedFileInputStream.Builder, IOUtils, ByteBufferCleaner). Although one outgoing target (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) itself links to many types, the analyzed class does not exhibit both a large number of incoming and outgoing connections required for a hub-like abstraction."
