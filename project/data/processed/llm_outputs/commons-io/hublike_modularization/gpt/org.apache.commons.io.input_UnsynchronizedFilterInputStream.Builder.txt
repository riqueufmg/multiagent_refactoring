    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only a single incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedFilterInputStream). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has only one incoming and zero outgoing, so it is not a hub."
