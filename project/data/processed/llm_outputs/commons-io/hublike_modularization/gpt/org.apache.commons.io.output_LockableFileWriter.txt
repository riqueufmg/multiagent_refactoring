    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and 5 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils, org.apache.commons.io.Charsets, org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOrigin, org.apache.commons.io.output.AbstractByteArrayOutputStream, org.apache.commons.io.output.LockableFileWriter.Builder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here there are no incoming dependencies and only a small set of outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not present."
