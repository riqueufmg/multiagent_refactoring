    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIntSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IOIntSupplier has a single outgoing dependency: org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck, and a single incoming dependency recorded: org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck. Although Uncheck itself references many IO* types (IOBiConsumer, IOIntConsumer, IOConsumer, IOQuadFunction, IOIntSupplier, IOComparator, IOTriFunction, IORunnable, IOSupplier, IOTriConsumer, IOBooleanSupplier, IOFunction, IOLongSupplier, IOBiFunction, IOPredicate), IOIntSupplier does not have both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Therefore it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
