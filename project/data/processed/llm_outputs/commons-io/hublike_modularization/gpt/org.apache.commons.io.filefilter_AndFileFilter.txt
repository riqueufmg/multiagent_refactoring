    "justification": "AndFileFilter has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.AbstractFileFilter and org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
