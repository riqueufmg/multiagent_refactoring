    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters). The incoming dependency set is small (one referring class), so it does not exhibit dependencies with a large number of other abstractions required for Hub-like Modularization."
