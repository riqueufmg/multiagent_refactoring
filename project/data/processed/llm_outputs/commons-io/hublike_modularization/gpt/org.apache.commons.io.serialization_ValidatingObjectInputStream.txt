    "justification": "Not detected: ValidatingObjectInputStream has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (ObjectStreamClassPredicate, ClassNameMatcher, ValidatingObjectInputStream.Builder) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires both many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing count is small, so the hub-like smell is not present."
