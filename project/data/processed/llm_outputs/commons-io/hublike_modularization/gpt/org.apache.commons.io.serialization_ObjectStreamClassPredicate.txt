    "justification": "ObjectStreamClassPredicate has 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ClassNameMatcher) and 2 incoming dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream and org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream.Builder). That is a total of 3 distinct connected abstractions. This small number of incoming/outgoing relationships does not constitute a hub-like modularization (no large number of dependencies)."
