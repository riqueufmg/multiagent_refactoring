    "justification": "Not detected: org.apache.commons.io.CopyUtils has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and/or outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; CopyUtils does not meet that condition. (Note: IOUtils itself references many abstractions, but CopyUtils directly depends only on IOUtils.)"
