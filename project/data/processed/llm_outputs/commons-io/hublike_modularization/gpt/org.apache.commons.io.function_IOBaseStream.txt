    "justification": "IOBaseStream has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions: org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIterator, org.apache.commons.io.function.IORunnable, org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOSpliterator, but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies means IOBaseStream is not a hub."
