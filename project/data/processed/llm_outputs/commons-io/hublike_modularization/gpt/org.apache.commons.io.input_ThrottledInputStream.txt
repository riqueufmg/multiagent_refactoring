    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ThrottledInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.ThrottledInputStream.Builder) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the dependency count is minimal, so the smell is not present."
