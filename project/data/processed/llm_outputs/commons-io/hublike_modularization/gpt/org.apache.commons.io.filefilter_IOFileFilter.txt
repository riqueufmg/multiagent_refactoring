    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 17 distinct classes depend on IOFileFilter (e.g., org.apache.commons.io.DirectoryWalker, org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils, org.apache.commons.io.file.CountingPathVisitor, and many org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.* classes such as TrueFileFilter, FalseFileFilter, FileFilterUtils). Outgoing dependencies: IOFileFilter depends on only 1 abstraction (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.AbstractFileFilter). The hub-like modularization smell requires the abstraction to have a large number of dependencies in both directions; here incoming is large but outgoing is minimal, so the class does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
