    "justification": "PathFileComparator has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOCase) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing). The provided data shows neither many outgoing nor incoming dependencies, so it is not a hub."
