    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.BrokenWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the class to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. org.apache.commons.io.output.BrokenWriter has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase) and zero incoming dependencies. Although org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase depends on many other abstractions, those are not direct incoming/outgoing ties of BrokenWriter (and analysis is limited to the class in isolation). Therefore BrokenWriter does not meet the hub-like criteria."
