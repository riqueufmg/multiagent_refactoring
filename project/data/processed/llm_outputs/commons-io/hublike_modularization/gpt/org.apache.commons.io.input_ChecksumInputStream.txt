    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.ChecksumInputStream.Builder) and zero incoming dependencies, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
