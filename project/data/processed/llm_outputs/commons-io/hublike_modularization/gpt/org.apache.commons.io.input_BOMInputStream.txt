    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BOMInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BOMInputStream has a small number of direct connections: 3 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.input.BOMInputStream.Builder, org.apache.commons.io.ByteOrderMark, org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader). Although org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils itself depends on many classes, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of BOMInputStream. Because the class does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
