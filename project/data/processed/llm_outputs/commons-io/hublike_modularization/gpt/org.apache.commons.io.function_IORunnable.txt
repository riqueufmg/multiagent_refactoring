    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IORunnable has 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck, org.apache.commons.io.function.Constants) and 4 incoming dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBaseStream, org.apache.commons.io.function.Constants, org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck, org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing. The counts here (2 outgoing, 4 incoming) are small, so IORunnable does not meet the hub-like smell criteria."
