    "justification": "CloseShieldWriter has 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.output.ClosedWriter) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows only a single outgoing and no incoming dependencies, so the smell is not present."
