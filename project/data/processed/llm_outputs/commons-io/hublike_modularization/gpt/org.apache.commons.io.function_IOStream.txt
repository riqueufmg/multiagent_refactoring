    "justification": "IOStream has many outgoing dependencies (13) — IOBiConsumer, IOBinaryOperator, IOStreams, IOBiFunction, IOComparator, IOUnaryOperator, IOSupplier, IOStreamAdapter, IOFunction, IOExceptionList, IOConsumer, IOPredicate, Erase — but only two incoming dependencies (IOStreams, IOStreamAdapter). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; incoming references are not numerous here, so the smell is not detected."
