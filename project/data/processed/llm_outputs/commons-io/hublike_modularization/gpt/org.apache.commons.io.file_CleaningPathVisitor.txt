    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.CleaningPathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CleaningPathVisitor has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils, org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters, org.apache.commons.io.file.CountingPathVisitor, org.apache.commons.io.file.StandardDeleteOption) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; CleaningPathVisitor lacks incoming dependencies and does not show a large number of outgoing ties, so it is not a hub."
