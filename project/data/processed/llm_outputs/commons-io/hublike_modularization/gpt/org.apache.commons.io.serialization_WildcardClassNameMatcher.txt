    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.serialization.WildcardClassNameMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections. Although FilenameUtils depends on two classes (org.apache.commons.io.FileSystem, org.apache.commons.io.IOCase), those are not direct dependencies of WildcardClassNameMatcher, so the class does not exhibit hub-like connectivity."
