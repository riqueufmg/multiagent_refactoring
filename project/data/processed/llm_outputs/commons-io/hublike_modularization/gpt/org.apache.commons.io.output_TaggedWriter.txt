    "justification": "TaggedWriter has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.TaggedIOException) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
