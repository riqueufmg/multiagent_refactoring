    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ClosedInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ClosedInputStream has a small set of direct relationships: 3 incoming dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.input.CloseShieldInputStream, org.apache.commons.io.input.AutoCloseInputStream, org.apache.commons.io.output.AbstractByteArrayOutputStream) and 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). The totals (3 incoming, 1 outgoing) do not constitute a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections required to qualify as Hub-like Modularization. Note: IOUtils' many dependencies are not direct dependencies of ClosedInputStream and are therefore not counted for this class-in-isolation analysis."
