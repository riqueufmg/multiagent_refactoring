    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.QueueOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "QueueOutputStream has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.QueueInputStream) and only one incoming dependency (from the same org.apache.commons.io.input.QueueInputStream). The total number of distinct incoming/outgoing connected abstractions is 1, so it does not have the large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies required for Hub-like Modularization."
