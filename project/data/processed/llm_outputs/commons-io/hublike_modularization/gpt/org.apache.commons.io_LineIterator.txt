    "justification": "LineIterator has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and 2 incoming dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; these counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
