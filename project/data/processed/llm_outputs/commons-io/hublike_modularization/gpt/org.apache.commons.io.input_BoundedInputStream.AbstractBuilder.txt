    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiConsumer, org.apache.commons.io.input.ProxyInputStream). With no incoming dependencies and a small number of outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
