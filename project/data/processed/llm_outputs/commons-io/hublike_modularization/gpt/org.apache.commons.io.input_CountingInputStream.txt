    "justification": "CountingInputStream has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.ProxyInputStream) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data does not show a large number of both for this class. (Although ProxyInputStream itself has multiple dependencies, they are not direct incoming/outgoing dependencies of CountingInputStream in the provided data.)"
