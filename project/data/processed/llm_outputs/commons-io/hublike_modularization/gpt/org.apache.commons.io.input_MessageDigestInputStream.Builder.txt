    "justification": "The class has 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.MessageDigestInputStream) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections to other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing counts are minimal, so the smell is not detected."
