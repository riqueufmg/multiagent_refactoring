    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.LastModifiedFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LastModifiedFileComparator has a single outgoing dependency: org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils (dependencies list contains only \"org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils\"). There are no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Although the referenced FileUtils entry shows many of its own dependencies, the class under analysis only directly connects to one other abstraction and has no incoming links. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; this class does not meet that criterion."
