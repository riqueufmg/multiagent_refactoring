    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.output.UncheckedFilterWriter.Builder and org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Because incoming_dependencies is empty and the direct outgoing count is small, the hub-like smell is not detected. (Although org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck has many dependencies, those are transitive and the analysis is limited to the class in isolation.)"
