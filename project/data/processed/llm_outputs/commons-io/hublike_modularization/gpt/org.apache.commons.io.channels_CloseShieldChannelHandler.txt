    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.channels.CloseShieldChannel) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that condition."
