    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReaderInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ReaderInputStream has a small set of direct relationships: 4 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, org.apache.commons.io.charset.CharsetEncoders, org.apache.commons.io.Charsets, org.apache.commons.io.input.ReaderInputStream.Builder) and a single incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.CharSequenceInputStream). Although org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils (one of the outgoing dependencies) itself references many classes, ReaderInputStream directly depends on only four abstractions and is referenced by only one—insufficient to qualify as hub-like modularization."
