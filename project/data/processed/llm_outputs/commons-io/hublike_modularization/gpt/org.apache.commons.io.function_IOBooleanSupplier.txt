    "justification": "IOBooleanSupplier has a single outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck) and a single incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck). There is only one other abstraction directly connected to IOBooleanSupplier, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (not a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
