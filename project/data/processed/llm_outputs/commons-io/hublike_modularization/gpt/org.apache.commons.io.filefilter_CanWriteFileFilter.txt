    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter) and one incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.CanReadFileFilter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the observed counts (1 incoming, 1 outgoing) are low, so the smell is not detected."
