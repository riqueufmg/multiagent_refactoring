    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 13 distinct classes depend on IOConsumer (RandomAccessFileMode, IOUtils, IOStreams, IOFunction, IOSpliterator, IOIterator, IOIterable, Uncheck, IOStream, Erase, ObservableInputStream, ThresholdingOutputStream, FilterCollectionWriter). Outgoing dependencies: IOConsumer directly depends on only 3 abstractions (org.apache.commons.io.IOExceptionList, org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStreams). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; IOConsumer has many incoming but only a small number of outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the definition."
