    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.WildcardFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: 0) and only four direct outgoing dependencies (WildcardFileFilter.Builder, IOCase, PathUtils, FilenameUtils). Although PathUtils lists many dependencies, those are transitive dependencies of PathUtils, not direct incoming/outgoing relations of WildcardFileFilter. Per the requirement to analyze the class in isolation, WildcardFileFilter does not exhibit the required pattern of having both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies."
