    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CircularInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CircularInputStream has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows neither many outgoing nor any incoming links for this class. Note: IOUtils itself has many dependencies, but by the isolation constraint we only consider CircularInputStream's direct dependencies."
