    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.IOExceptionList, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOConsumer). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have numerous both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows no incoming links and a small number of outgoing links, so it does not qualify."
