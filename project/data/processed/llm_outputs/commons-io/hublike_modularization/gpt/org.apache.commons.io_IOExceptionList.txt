    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOExceptionList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IOExceptionList has 0 outgoing dependencies (analyzed_package.dependencies is empty) and 5 incoming dependencies from: org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStreams, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStream, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOConsumer, org.apache.commons.io.output.FilterCollectionWriter. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here there are no outgoing dependencies, so the class is not a hub."
