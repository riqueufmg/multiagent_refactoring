    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedBufferedReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "UnsynchronizedBufferedReader has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the single outgoing dependency (IOUtils) itself has many dependencies, those are dependencies of IOUtils, not incoming to UnsynchronizedBufferedReader, so UnsynchronizedBufferedReader is not a hub."
