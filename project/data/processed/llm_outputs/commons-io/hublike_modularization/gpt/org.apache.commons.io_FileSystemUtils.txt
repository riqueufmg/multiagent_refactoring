    "justification": "Not detected. The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (to org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; FileSystemUtils does not show a large number of incoming or outgoing connections. (Note: FileUtils has many dependencies, but per the constraint the analysis considers FileSystemUtils in isolation.)"
