    "justification": "The class has 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedByteArrayInputStream) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here the counts (incoming=1, outgoing=0) do not meet that criterion."
