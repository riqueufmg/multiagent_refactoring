    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer). Because it lacks a large number of both incoming and outgoing relations, it is not a hub-like module."
