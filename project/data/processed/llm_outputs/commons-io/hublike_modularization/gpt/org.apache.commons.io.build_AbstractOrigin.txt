    "justification": "AbstractOrigin has outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (org.apache.commons.io.RandomAccessFileMode, org.apache.commons.io.Charsets) and incoming dependencies from 3 abstractions (org.apache.commons.io.output.LockableFileWriter, org.apache.commons.io.output.LockableFileWriter.Builder, org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOriginSupplier). The number of both incoming (3) and outgoing (2) relationships is small, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
