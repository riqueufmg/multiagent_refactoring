    "justification": "SizeFileFilter has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.FileFilterUtils). Although FileFilterUtils depends on many classes (including SizeFileFilter), SizeFileFilter itself does not have both many incoming and many outgoing links required for a hub-like modularization smell."
