    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BrokenOutputStream has only one direct outgoing dependency: org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase, and no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although Erase itself depends on multiple interfaces (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiConsumer, IOConsumer, IOComparator, IORunnable, IOSupplier, IOFunction, IOBiFunction, IOPredicate), these are indirect and do not make BrokenOutputStream a hub (direct incoming=0, direct outgoing=1)."
