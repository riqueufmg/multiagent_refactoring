    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. In the provided data this class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies: []) and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.output.ChunkedOutputStream). Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
