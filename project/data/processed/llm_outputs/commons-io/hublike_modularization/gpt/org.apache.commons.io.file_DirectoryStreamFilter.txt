    "justification": "DirectoryStreamFilter has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two outgoing dependencies: org.apache.commons.io.file.PathFilter and org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not meet that condition. (While PathUtils lists many dependencies, those are not incoming to DirectoryStreamFilter.)"
