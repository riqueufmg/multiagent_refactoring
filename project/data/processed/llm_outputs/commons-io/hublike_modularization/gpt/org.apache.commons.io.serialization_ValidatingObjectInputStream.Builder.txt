    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Builder has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ObjectStreamClassPredicate) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream). A hub requires many incoming and/or outgoing dependencies; these counts are low, so this class is not a hub-like module. Note: org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ClassNameMatcher appears in the graph but is an outgoing dependency of ObjectStreamClassPredicate and an additional dependency of ValidatingObjectInputStream, not a direct dependency of the Builder."
