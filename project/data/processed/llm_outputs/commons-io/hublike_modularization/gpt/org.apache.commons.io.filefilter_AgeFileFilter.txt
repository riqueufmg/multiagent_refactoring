    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AgeFileFilter has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils) and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and outgoing). The provided data shows only a single direct outgoing link and zero incoming links, so AgeFileFilter is not a hub."
