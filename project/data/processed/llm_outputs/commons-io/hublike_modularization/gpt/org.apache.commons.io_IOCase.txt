    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOCase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IOCase has many incoming dependencies (13 unique incoming classes: FilenameUtils; FileAlterationObserver; FileAlterationObserver.Builder; PathFileComparator; ExtensionFileComparator; NameFileComparator; SuffixFileFilter; FileFilterUtils; WildcardFileFilter; WildcardFileFilter.Builder; PrefixFileFilter; RegexFileFilter; NameFileFilter) but zero outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies in both directions (a large number of incoming and outgoing). Because IOCase has no outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
