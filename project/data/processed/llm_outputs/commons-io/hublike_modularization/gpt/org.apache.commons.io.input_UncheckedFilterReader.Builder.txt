    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedFilterReader). With only a single incoming link and no outgoing links, it does not exhibit hub-like connectivity."
