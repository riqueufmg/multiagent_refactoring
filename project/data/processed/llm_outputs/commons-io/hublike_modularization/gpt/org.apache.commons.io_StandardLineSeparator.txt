    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.StandardLineSeparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StandardLineSeparator has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (from org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils and org.apache.commons.io.input.ReversedLinesFileReader). Although IOUtils has many dependencies including StandardLineSeparator, that represents a single incoming link to StandardLineSeparator. The class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
