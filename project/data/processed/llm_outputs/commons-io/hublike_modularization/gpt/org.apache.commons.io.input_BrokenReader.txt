    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BrokenReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the class to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. BrokenReader has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase) and zero incoming dependencies. Although the referenced Erase class has multiple outgoing dependencies, those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of BrokenReader (analysis is limited to the class in isolation), so BrokenReader is not a hub."
