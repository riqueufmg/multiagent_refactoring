    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.PathVisitorFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three direct outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.file.NoopPathVisitor, org.apache.commons.io.file.PathVisitor, org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. (Although PathUtils itself lists many dependencies, the analyzed class's direct incoming/outgoing degree is small.)"
