    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsupportedOperationExceptions) and 0 incoming dependencies, so it does not meet the 'hub-like' criteria."
