    "justification": "FileFileFilter has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter) and only 2 incoming dependents (org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils and org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.FileFilterUtils). While the incoming dependents reference many other types, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies required for a hub-like modularization smell."
