    "justification": "UnsynchronizedReader has 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.input.Input, org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has a very small number of outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
