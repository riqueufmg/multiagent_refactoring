    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IORandomAccessFile",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IORandomAccessFile has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.RandomAccessFileMode, org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOriginSupplier). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class shows minimal incoming coupling and no outgoing coupling, so it does not exhibit the smell."
