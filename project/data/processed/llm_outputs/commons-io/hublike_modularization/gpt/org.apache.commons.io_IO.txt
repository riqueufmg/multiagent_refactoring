    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IO",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only a single outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Here outgoing count = 1 and incoming count = 0, so the class does not meet the hub-like criteria (even though the referenced IOUtils has many dependencies, the smell is assessed on IO in isolation)."
