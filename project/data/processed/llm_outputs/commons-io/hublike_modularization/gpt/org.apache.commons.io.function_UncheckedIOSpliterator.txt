    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOSpliterator) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (both incoming and outgoing). Given the provided data (outgoing: [org.apache.commons.io.function.IOSpliterator], incoming: []), this class does not meet that criterion."
