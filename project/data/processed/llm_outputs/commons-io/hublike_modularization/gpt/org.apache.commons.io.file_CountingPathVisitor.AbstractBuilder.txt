    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.CountingPathVisitor.AbstractBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of relationships: outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (org.apache.commons.io.file.PathFilter, org.apache.commons.io.file.SimplePathVisitor) and a single incoming dependency from org.apache.commons.io.file.CountingPathVisitor. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided counts are low, so this is not a hub."
