    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.FileWriterWithEncoding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.Charsets, org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils, org.apache.commons.io.output.FileWriterWithEncoding.Builder). Although org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils itself depends on many classes, FileWriterWithEncoding's direct dependency set is small and does not exhibit the large number of both incoming and outgoing relations required for Hub-like Modularization."
