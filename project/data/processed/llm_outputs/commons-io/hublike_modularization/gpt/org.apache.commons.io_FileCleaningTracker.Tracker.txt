    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.FileDeleteStrategy) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided metrics show neither a large outgoing set nor any incoming dependencies, so this is not a hub-like module."
