    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.TailerListener",

    "justification": "TailerListener has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer) and only 2 incoming dependents (org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer and org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer.Builder). Both fan-in and fan-out are small and limited to closely related classes in the same package, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization (which requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
