    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.Constants",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Constants has outgoing dependencies to 6 abstractions (IOBiConsumer, IORunnable, IOTriConsumer, IOFunction, IOBiFunction, IOPredicate) and incoming dependencies from 5 abstractions (IOFunction, IOPredicate, IORunnable, IOTriConsumer, IOBiConsumer). Multiple classes appear on both incoming and outgoing lists (IOFunction, IOPredicate, IORunnable, IOTriConsumer, IOBiConsumer), indicating bidirectional coupling with many other abstractions. The presence of numerous incoming and outgoing links makes Constants act as a central hub, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
