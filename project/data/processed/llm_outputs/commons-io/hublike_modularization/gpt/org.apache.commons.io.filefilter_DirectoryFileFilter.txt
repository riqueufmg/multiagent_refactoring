    "justification": "DirectoryFileFilter has a very small dependency footprint: only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.FileFilterUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; those conditions are not met here."
