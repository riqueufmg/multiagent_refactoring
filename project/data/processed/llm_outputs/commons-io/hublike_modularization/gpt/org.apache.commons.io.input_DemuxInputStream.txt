    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. DemuxInputStream has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and 0 incoming dependencies. Although IOUtils (the single outgoing dependency) has many of its own dependencies, DemuxInputStream itself does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
