    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IOQuadFunction has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOFunction) and only 1 incoming dependency source (org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here the counts are low (incoming=1, outgoing=1), so IOQuadFunction is not a hub."
