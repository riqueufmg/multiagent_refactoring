    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ProxyWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ProxyWriter has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing_count=1 and incoming_count=0. Although IOUtils itself has many dependencies, ProxyWriter does not have many direct incoming or outgoing connections, so it is not a hub."
