    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and 0 incoming dependencies (no entries in outgoing_dependencies or incoming_dependencies). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; with zero in both directions this class does not exhibit the hub-like smell."
