    "justification": "The class has zero outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only one incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.input.ReversedLinesFileReader). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections; this class lacks both a large number of incoming references and any outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
