    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BufferedFileChannelInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.input.BufferedFileChannelInputStream). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here the dependency counts are low. Note: the incoming class lists four dependencies overall, but that does not make the Builder itself a hub."
