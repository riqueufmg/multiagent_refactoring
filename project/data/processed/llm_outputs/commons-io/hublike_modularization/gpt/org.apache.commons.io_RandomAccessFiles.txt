    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.RandomAccessFiles",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "RandomAccessFiles has only one direct outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and only two incoming dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils and org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.MagicNumberFileFilter). Although IOUtils itself depends on many classes, RandomAccessFiles does not directly depend on them. Therefore RandomAccessFiles does not exhibit hub-like modularization (it lacks a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
