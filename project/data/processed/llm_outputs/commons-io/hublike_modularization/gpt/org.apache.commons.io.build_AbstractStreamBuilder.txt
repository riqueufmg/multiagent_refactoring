    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractStreamBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies: org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils, org.apache.commons.io.Charsets, org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing依dependencies. Here incoming_dependencies is empty (0), and outgoing count is small (3). Although two outgoing targets (PathUtils and IOUtils) themselves depend on many other classes, AbstractStreamBuilder itself does not exhibit the required high in-degree and high out-degree, so it is not a hub."
