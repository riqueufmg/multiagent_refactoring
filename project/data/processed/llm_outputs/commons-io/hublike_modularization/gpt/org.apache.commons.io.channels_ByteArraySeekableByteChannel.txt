    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.channels.ByteArraySeekableByteChannel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. Note: IOUtils itself depends on many types, but those are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class."
