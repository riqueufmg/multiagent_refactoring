    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IOSupplier has incoming dependencies from 7 distinct classes (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOFunction, org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStream, org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase, org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils, org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.AbstractFileFilter) but only a single outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although IOSupplier is referenced by many classes (7 incoming) and participates in a mutual dependency with Uncheck, it does not have a correspondingly large number of outgoing dependencies, so it does not qualify as a hub."
