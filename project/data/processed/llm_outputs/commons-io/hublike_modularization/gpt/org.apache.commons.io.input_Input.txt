    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and 4 incoming dependencies (UnsynchronizedReader, AbstractInputStream, BufferedFileChannelInputStream, ProxyInputStream). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing dependencies are absent, so the hub-like smell is not present."
