    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.ScratchBytes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. IOUtils.ScratchBytes has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []), and only a single incoming dependency entry (from org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). Although IOUtils lists many dependencies, that reflects IOUtils, not ScratchBytes. With 0 outgoing and 1 incoming dependency, the class does not meet the 'hub-like' criteria."
