    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOCase) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.WildcardFileFilter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; those counts are low here, so the smell is not present."
