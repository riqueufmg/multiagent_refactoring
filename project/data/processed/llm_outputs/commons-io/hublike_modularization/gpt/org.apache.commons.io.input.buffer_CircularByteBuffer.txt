    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CircularByteBuffer has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.buffer.CircularBufferInputStream). Although IOUtils itself depends on many abstractions, CircularByteBuffer does not have direct incoming and outgoing links to a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
