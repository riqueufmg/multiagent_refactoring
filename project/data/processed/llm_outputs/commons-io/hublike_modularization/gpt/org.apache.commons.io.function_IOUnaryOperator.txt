    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOUnaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IOUnaryOperator has no outgoing dependencies (empty list) and only a single incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStream). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; IOUnaryOperator does not meet this criterion. (Note: org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStream depends on many classes, but that makes IOStream a potential hub, not IOUnaryOperator.)"
