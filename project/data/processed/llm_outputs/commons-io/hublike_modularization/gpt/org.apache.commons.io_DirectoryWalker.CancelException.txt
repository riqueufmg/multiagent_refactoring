    "justification": "Not detected: Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (referenced by org.apache.commons.io.DirectoryWalker). The incoming dependency list for DirectoryWalker shows CancelException as one of four dependencies, so DirectoryWalker.CancelException is not a hub."
