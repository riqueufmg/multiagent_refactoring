    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.MessageDigestCalculatingInputStream.Builder) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing). Given the single outgoing and no incoming dependencies, this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
