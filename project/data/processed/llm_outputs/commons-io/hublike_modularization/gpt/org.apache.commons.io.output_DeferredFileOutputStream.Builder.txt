    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.output.DeferredFileOutputStream) and 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.output.AbstractByteArrayOutputStream). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and many outgoing); this class does not meet that criterion."
