    "justification": "RandomAccessFileInputStream has only two outgoing dependencies: org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils and org.apache.commons.io.input.RandomAccessFileInputStream.Builder, and it has no incoming dependencies. Although org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils itself depends on many classes, RandomAccessFileInputStream does not have both large incoming and outgoing dependency sets required for Hub-like Modularization (incoming dependencies = 0, outgoing dependencies = 2)."
