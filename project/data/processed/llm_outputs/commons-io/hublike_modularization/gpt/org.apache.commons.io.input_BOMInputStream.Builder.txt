    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.BOMInputStream) and one direct outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.ByteOrderMark). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing counts are minimal. (Although ByteOrderMark depends on org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, that is a transitive dependency and does not increase the Builder's direct incoming/outgoing dependency counts.)"
