    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CloseShieldInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CloseShieldInputStream has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.ClosedInputStream) and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows neither, so the class is not a hub."
