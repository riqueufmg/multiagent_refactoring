    "justification": "IOStreamAdapter has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStream) and only one incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStream). The hub-like smell requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here only a single other abstraction is involved, so the smell is not present."
