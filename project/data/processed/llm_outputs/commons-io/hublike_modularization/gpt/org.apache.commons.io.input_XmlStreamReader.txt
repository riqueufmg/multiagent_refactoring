    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "XmlStreamReader has 5 outgoing dependencies (XmlStreamReader.Builder, ByteOrderMark, XmlStreamReaderException, BOMInputStream, IOUtils) but only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.output.XmlStreamWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships. The incoming degree is low (1), so XmlStreamReader does not act as a hub despite referencing a few other components (notably IOUtils, which itself is highly connected). Therefore it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
