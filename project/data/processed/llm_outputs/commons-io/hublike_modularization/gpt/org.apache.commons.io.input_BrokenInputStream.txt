    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BrokenInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BrokenInputStream has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows 1 outgoing and 0 incoming links. Note: Erase itself depends on many interfaces, but those are dependencies of Erase, not of BrokenInputStream, so the smell is not present for BrokenInputStream."
