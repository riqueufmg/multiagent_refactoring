    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IOComparator has 5 incoming dependencies (IOSpliterator, Uncheck, IOStream, IOBinaryOperator, Erase) and only 1 outgoing dependency (Uncheck). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing connections. Although Uncheck (an adjacent class) connects to many types, when considering IOComparator in isolation it has only one outgoing dependency, so it does not qualify as a hub."
