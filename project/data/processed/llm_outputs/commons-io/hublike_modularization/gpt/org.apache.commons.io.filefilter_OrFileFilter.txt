    "justification": "OrFileFilter depends on org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.AbstractFileFilter and org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter (2 outgoing dependencies) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 2 (not a large number), so it is not a hub."
