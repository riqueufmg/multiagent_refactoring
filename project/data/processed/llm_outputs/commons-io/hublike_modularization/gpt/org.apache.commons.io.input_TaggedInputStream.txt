    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. In this case, TaggedInputStream has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.TaggedIOException). With only a single outgoing dependency and no incoming dependencies, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
