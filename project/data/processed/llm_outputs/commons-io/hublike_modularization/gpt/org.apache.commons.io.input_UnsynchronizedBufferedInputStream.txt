    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedBufferedInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: incoming_dependencies is empty (no other abstractions depend on this class). Outgoing dependencies are limited to 2 direct targets: org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedBufferedInputStream.Builder and org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils. Having only two direct incoming/outgoing links (and zero incoming) does not meet the 'large number of other abstractions' criterion for Hub-like Modularization. Note: org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils has many of its own dependencies, but those are not direct incoming dependencies to the analyzed class and do not make the analyzed class a hub."
