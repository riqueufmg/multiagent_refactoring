    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ChunkedWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ChunkedWriter has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced IOUtils class has many dependencies, the analysis must consider ChunkedWriter in isolation, so it does not qualify as a hub."
