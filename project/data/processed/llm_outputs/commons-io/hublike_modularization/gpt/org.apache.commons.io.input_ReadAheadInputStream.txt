    "justification": "Incoming dependencies are empty (no other abstractions depend on this class). Direct outgoing dependencies are only two: org.apache.commons.io.input.ReadAheadInputStream.Builder and org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils. Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here there are no incoming dependencies and only two direct outgoing dependencies. (The many entries listed under org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils are IOUtils's own dependencies, not incoming links to ReadAheadInputStream.)"
