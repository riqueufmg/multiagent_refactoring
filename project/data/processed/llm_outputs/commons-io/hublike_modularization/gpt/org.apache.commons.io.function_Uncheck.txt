    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Uncheck has a large number of both outgoing and incoming dependencies, consistent with a hub-like abstraction. Outgoing: Uncheck depends on 15 distinct function interfaces (e.g. IOBiConsumer, IOIntConsumer, IOConsumer, IOQuadFunction, IOIntSupplier, IOComparator, IOTriFunction, IORunnable, IOSupplier, IOTriConsumer, IOBooleanSupplier, IOFunction, IOLongSupplier, IOBiFunction, IOPredicate). Incoming: at least 18 other classes reference Uncheck, including core utilities and wrappers (e.g. org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils; many org.apache.commons.io.function interfaces such as IOFunction, IOConsumer, IOSupplier, IOPredicate, IORunnable, IOIntSupplier, IOLongSupplier, IOComparator, IOBiFunction, IOBiConsumer; and unchecked IO wrappers like UncheckedIOIterator, UncheckedFilterReader, UncheckedBufferedReader, UncheckedFilterInputStream, UncheckedFilterWriter, UncheckedFilterOutputStream). Several dependencies are mutual (e.g. IOFunction, IOConsumer, IOSupplier, IOBiFunction reference Uncheck while Uncheck references those same interfaces), indicating Uncheck acts as a central hub connecting many abstractions."
