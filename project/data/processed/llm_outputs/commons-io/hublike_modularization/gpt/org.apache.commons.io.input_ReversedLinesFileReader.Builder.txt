    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReversedLinesFileReader.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has a single incoming dependency from org.apache.commons.io.input.ReversedLinesFileReader (incoming_dependencies contains only that class). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; here there is only one incoming and zero outgoing, so the smell is not present."
