    "justification": "The class has 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.FileSystem) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; the provided data shows only a single incoming link and no outgoing links, so the smell is not present."
