    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.WriterOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "WriterOutputStream has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions (org.apache.commons.io.output.WriterOutputStream.Builder, org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, org.apache.commons.io.Charsets, org.apache.commons.io.charset.CharsetDecoders) but has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; the lack of incoming dependencies means this class is not a hub."
