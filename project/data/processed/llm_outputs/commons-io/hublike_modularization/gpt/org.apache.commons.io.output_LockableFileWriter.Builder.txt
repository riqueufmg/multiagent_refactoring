    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.LockableFileWriter.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.output.AbstractByteArrayOutputStream, org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOrigin) and a single incoming dependency from org.apache.commons.io.output.LockableFileWriter. These counts are small and do not show dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
