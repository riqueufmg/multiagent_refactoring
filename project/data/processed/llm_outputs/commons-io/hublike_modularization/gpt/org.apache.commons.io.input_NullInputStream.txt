    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NullInputStream has 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsupportedOperationExceptions) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; given the low outgoing count and absence of incoming dependencies, this class is not a hub."
