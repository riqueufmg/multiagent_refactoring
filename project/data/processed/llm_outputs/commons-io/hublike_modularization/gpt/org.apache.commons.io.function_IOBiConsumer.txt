    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IOBiConsumer has incoming dependencies from 6 classes (Constants, Uncheck, IOStream, Erase, BoundedInputStream, BoundedInputStream.AbstractBuilder) but only 2 outgoing dependencies (Uncheck, Constants). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing dependency set is small and the total number of unique connected abstractions (6) is not sufficiently large to qualify as a hub."
