    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 0 outgoing dependencies (incoming_dependencies = [], outgoing_dependencies = []). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; with zero incoming and outgoing dependencies this class does not exhibit that smell."
