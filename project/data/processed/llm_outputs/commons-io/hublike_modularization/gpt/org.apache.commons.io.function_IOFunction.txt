    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IOFunction has 4 outgoing dependencies (Constants, Uncheck, IOSupplier, IOConsumer) and 10 incoming dependents (RandomAccessFileMode, IOTriFunction, Constants, Uncheck, IOStream, IOBiFunction, Erase, IOQuadFunction, PathUtils, ThresholdingOutputStream). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here the outgoing fan-out is small (4), so IOFunction does not qualify as a hub despite moderate fan-in."
