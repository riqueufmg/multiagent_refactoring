    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.NullWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NullWriter has a single outgoing dependency: org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, and a single incoming dependency from org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils (both lists show only IOUtils referencing NullWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing connection counts = 1 (only to IOUtils), so NullWriter is not a hub."
