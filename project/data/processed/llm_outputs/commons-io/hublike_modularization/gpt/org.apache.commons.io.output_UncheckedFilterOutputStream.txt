    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.output.UncheckedFilterOutputStream.Builder and org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck). Although Uncheck itself references many function types, the analyzed class does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing direct relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
