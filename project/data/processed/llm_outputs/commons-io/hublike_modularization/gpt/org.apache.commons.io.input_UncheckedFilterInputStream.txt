    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedFilterInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedFilterInputStream.Builder and org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows no large number of incoming or outgoing direct dependencies. Note: org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck has many dependencies, but those are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class."
