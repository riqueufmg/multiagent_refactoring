    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 1 (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). Incoming dependencies: 0. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not have multiple incoming/outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected. (Although the referenced org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils lists many dependencies, NullAppendable itself only depends on that single class.)"
