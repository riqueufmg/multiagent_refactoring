    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.ThreadMonitor",

    "justification": "ThreadMonitor has 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.ThreadUtils) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; the provided dependency counts are minimal, so the smell is not present."
