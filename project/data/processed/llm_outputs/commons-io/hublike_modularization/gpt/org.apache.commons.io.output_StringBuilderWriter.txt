    "justification": "StringBuilderWriter has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; the observed counts (incoming = 1, outgoing = 0) are insufficient. The many entries listed under IOUtils are IOUtils's own dependencies, not dependencies of StringBuilderWriter."
