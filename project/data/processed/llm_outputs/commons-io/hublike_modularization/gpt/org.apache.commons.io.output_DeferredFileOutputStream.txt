    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.DeferredFileOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No: DeferredFileOutputStream has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only four direct outgoing dependencies (DeferredFileOutputStream.Builder, AbstractByteArrayOutputStream, PathUtils, ByteArrayOutputStream). Although one outgoing dependency (PathUtils) itself references many classes, the smell requires the abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing direct connections; this class lacks incoming links and has a small set of direct outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
