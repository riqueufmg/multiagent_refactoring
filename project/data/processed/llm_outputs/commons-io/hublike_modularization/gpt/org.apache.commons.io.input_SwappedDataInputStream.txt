    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.EndianUtils, org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsupportedOperationExceptions) and 0 incoming dependencies. The low number of outgoing links and absence of incoming links indicate it is not a hub."
