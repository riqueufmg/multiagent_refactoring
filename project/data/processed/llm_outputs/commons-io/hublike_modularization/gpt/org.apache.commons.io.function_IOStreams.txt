Outgoing dependencies (4): org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStream, org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase, org.apache.commons.io.IOExceptionList, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOConsumer. Incoming dependencies (2): org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStream, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOConsumer. Unique connected abstractions = 4 (some overlap between incoming and outgoing). This does not constitute a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies required for a hub-like module."
