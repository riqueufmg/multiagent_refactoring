    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.NullPrintStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NullPrintStream has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.output.NullOutputStream) and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; those conditions are not met. (Note: NullOutputStream depends on org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, but NullPrintStream itself has no large number of direct incoming/outgoing dependencies.)"
