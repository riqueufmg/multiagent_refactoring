    "justification": "AccumulatorPathVisitor has a small set of outgoing dependencies (5: org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils, org.apache.commons.io.file.AccumulatorPathVisitor.Builder, org.apache.commons.io.file.PathFilter, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiFunction, org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters) and only two incoming dependents (2: org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils, org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils). The counts of both incoming and outgoing relationships are low and include overlap (PathUtils appears both incoming and outgoing), so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
