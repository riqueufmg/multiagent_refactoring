    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedBufferedReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "UncheckedBufferedReader has only two direct outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck and org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedBufferedReader.Builder) and zero incoming dependencies. Although the Uncheck target itself references many types, from the UncheckedBufferedReader's perspective this is a single outgoing dependency. A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing direct dependencies, which is not the case here."
