    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.output.AbstractByteArrayOutputStream). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class interacts with a single other abstraction, so it is not a hub."
