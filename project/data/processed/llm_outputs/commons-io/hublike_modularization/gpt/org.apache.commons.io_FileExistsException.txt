    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileExistsException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Although FileUtils lists many dependencies (including FileExistsException), FileExistsException itself is not connected to a large number of abstractions (incoming_count=1, outgoing_count=0), so the smell is not present."
