    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiFunction) and 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.file.SimplePathVisitor). Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing counts are minimal. Note: IOBiFunction has further dependencies (Uncheck, IOFunction) but those are not direct dependencies of AbstractBuilder, so they do not increase its outgoing count."
