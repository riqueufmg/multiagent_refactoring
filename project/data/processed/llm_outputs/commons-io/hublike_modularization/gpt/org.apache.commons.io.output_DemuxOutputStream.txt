    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.DemuxOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with many other abstractions. DemuxOutputStream has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and zero incoming dependencies. Although IOUtils itself lists many dependencies, DemuxOutputStream directly depends on only a single class and has no incoming ties, so it does not qualify as a hub."
