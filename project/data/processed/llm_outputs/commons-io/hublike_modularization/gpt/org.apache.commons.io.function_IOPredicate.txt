    "justification": "IOPredicate has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck, org.apache.commons.io.function.Constants) and incoming dependencies from 4 classes (org.apache.commons.io.function.Constants, org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStream, org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase). The total number of directly connected abstractions is 4, which is not a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships required to qualify as Hub-like Modularization. Note: several related classes (Uncheck, Constants, IOStream, Erase) have many dependencies themselves, but those are not direct incoming/outgoing links of IOPredicate and therefore do not make IOPredicate a hub."
