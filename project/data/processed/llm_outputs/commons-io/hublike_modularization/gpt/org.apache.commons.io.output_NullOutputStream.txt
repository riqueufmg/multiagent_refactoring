    "justification": "NullOutputStream has few dependencies: outgoing count = 1 (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). Incoming count = 3 (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, org.apache.commons.io.output.ThresholdingOutputStream, org.apache.commons.io.output.NullPrintStream). There is no large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships for this class, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
