    "justification": "FileCleaningTracker has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.FileDeleteStrategy, org.apache.commons.io.FileCleaningTracker.Reaper) and 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.FileCleaner). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows a small number of connections, so this is not a hub-like module."
