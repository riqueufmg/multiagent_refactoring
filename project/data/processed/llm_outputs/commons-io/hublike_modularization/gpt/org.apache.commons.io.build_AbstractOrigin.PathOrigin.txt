    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOrigin.PathOrigin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.RandomAccessFileMode) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing target RandomAccessFileMode itself depends on three classes (org.apache.commons.io.IORandomAccessFile, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOFunction, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOConsumer), the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming or outgoing links, so the smell is not detected."
