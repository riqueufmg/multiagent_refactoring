    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.output.UncheckedFilterWriter). A hub-like modularization would require many incoming and/or outgoing connections across numerous other abstractions; this class does not exhibit that pattern."
