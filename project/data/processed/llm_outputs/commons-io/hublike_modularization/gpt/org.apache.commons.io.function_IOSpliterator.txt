    "justification": "IOSpliterator has a limited number of dependencies: 3 outgoing (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOComparator, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOSpliteratorAdapter, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOConsumer) and 3 incoming (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBaseStream, org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIterable, org.apache.commons.io.function.UncheckedIOSpliterator). Because the counts of both incoming and outgoing relationships are small, it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell (which requires many incoming and outgoing couplings)."
