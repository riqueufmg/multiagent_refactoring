    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.HiddenFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided metrics do not show a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not present."
