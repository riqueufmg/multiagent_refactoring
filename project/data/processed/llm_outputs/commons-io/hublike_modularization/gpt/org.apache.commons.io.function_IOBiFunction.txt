    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiFunction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IOBiFunction has a significant number of incoming dependents (9 distinct classes reference it: Constants, Uncheck, IOStream, Erase, SimplePathVisitor, SimplePathVisitor.AbstractBuilder, NoopPathVisitor, CountingPathVisitor, AccumulatorPathVisitor) but only 2 outgoing dependencies (Uncheck, IOFunction). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Because IOBiFunction's outgoing dependency set is small, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
