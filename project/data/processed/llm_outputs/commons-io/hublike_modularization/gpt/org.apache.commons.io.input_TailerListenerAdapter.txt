    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.TailerListenerAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []) and only a single outgoing dependency on org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; here the provided data shows only one outgoing and zero incoming dependencies, so the smell is not present."
