    "justification": "CharSequenceReader has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; CharSequenceReader lacks outgoing dependencies and only has a single incoming link, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
