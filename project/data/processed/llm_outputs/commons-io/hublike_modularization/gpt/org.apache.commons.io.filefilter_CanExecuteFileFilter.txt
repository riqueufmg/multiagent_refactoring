    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; these counts are low and do not meet that criterion. The outgoing link to IOFileFilter (which itself references AbstractFileFilter) is a single dependency and does not create a hub."
