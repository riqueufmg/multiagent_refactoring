    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 incoming dependencies (UnixLineEndingInputStream, WindowsLineEndingInputStream, NullInputStream, MarkShieldInputStream, SwappedDataInputStream, NullReader) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because outgoing dependencies are absent, this is not a hub-like modularization."
