    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.InfiniteCircularInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (incoming_dependencies = 0, outgoing_dependencies = 0). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; since both dependency lists are empty for org.apache.commons.io.input.InfiniteCircularInputStream, the smell is not present."
