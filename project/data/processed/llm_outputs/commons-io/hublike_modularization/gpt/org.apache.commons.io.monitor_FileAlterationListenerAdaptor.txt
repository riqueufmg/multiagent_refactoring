    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileAlterationListenerAdaptor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []) and only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileAlterationObserver). Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows neither many incoming nor many outgoing connections, so the smell is not present."
