    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BufferedFileChannelInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BufferedFileChannelInputStream is not hub-like: it has zero incoming dependencies and only four direct outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.input.BufferedFileChannelInputStream.Builder, org.apache.commons.io.input.Input, org.apache.commons.io.input.ByteBufferCleaner, org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; the analyzed class lacks incoming links and has a small number of direct outgoing links. Note: although one outgoing target (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) itself depends on many types, that does not make the analyzed class a hub because it represents a single direct outgoing dependency from the class's perspective."
