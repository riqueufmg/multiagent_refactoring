    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedFilterReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies and only two direct outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedFilterReader.Builder and org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing links; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 2, so it does not qualify. (Although the outgoing dependency Uncheck itself depends on many function interfaces, that does not make UncheckedFilterReader have many direct incoming/outgoing dependencies when analyzed in isolation.)"
