    "justification": "FileCleaner has only outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (org.apache.commons.io.FileDeleteStrategy, org.apache.commons.io.FileCleaningTracker) and has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data does not meet that condition."
