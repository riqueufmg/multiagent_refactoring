    "justification": "FileChannels has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although IOUtils (the single outgoing dependency) itself depends on many classes (17 listed dependencies), FileChannels directly interacts with only one abstraction, so it is not a hub."
