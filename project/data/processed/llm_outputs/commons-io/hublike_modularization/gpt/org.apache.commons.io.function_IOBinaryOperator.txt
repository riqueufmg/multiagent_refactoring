    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBinaryOperator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. IOBinaryOperator has only one outgoing dependency: org.apache.commons.io.function.IOComparator, and only one incoming dependency: from org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStream. Although IOStream itself depends on many classes, that reflects IOStream's outgoing dependencies, not additional distinct incoming/outgoing links for IOBinaryOperator. Therefore IOBinaryOperator is not a hub."
