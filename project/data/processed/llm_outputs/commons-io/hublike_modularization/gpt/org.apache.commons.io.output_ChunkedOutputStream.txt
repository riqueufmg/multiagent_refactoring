    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ChunkedOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ChunkedOutputStream has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.output.ChunkedOutputStream.Builder and org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Note: IOUtils' many dependencies are not direct incoming/outgoing links of ChunkedOutputStream and therefore do not make ChunkedOutputStream a hub."
