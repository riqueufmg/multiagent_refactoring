    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IOIntConsumer has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 3 incoming dependents (org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck, org.apache.commons.io.input.ProxyInputStream, org.apache.commons.io.input.ProxyInputStream.AbstractBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; IOIntConsumer lacks outgoing dependencies and has a small number of incoming dependencies, so it is not a hub."
