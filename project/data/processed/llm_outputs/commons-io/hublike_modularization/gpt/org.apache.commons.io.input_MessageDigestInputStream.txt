    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.input.MessageDigestInputStream.Builder) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; the provided data shows no broad set of dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
