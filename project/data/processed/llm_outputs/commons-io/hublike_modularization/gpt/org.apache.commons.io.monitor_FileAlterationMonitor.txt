    "justification": "No. The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []), and only two outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileAlterationObserver, org.apache.commons.io.ThreadUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires large numbers of both incoming and outgoing connections; these counts are low so the smell is not present."
