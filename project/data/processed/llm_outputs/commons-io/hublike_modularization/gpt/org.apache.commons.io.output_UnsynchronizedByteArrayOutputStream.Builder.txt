    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.UnsynchronizedByteArrayOutputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Builder has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies empty) and only a single incoming dependency (from org.apache.commons.io.output.UnsynchronizedByteArrayOutputStream). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class shows minimal incoming (1) and zero outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the smell criteria."
