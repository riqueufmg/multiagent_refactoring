    "justification": "ConditionalFileFilter has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; these counts (outgoing=1, incoming=0) do not meet that criterion. Note: the outgoing target's dependency on org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.AbstractFileFilter does not increase ConditionalFileFilter's incoming/outgoing connectivity."
