    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer.Tailable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (empty dependencies list) and only a single incoming dependency source (org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here there are neither many incoming (only one) nor any outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
