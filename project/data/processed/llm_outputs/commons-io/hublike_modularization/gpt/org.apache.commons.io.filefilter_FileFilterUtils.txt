    "justification": "FileFilterUtils has 8 outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils, FileFileFilter, SizeFileFilter, TrueFileFilter, IOFileFilter, FalseFileFilter, org.apache.commons.io.IOCase, DirectoryFileFilter) but only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.DirectoryWalker). Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. The low incoming coupling (single client) prevents this class from qualifying as a hub."
