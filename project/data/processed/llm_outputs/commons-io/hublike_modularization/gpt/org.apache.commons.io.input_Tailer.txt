    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Tailer has a limited number of direct relations: 7 outgoing dependencies (Tailer.RandomAccessResourceBridge, Tailer.Builder, Tailer.Tailable, TailerListener, org.apache.commons.io.file.attribute.FileTimes, org.apache.commons.io.ThreadUtils, org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils) and 2 incoming dependencies (TailerListenerAdapter, TailerListener). Several outgoing dependencies are its own nested types (RandomAccessResourceBridge, Builder, Tailable) and the incoming relations are concentrated on listener classes. The counts of distinct incoming (2) and outgoing (7) collaborators are not large enough to characterize Tailer as a hub that connects a large number of other abstractions."
