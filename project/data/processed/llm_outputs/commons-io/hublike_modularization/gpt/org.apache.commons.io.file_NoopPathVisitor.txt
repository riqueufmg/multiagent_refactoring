    "justification": "NoopPathVisitor has only one direct outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiFunction) and only one incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.PathVisitorFileFilter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the observed incoming and outgoing counts are low. (While IOBiFunction itself depends on Uncheck and IOFunction, those are not direct dependencies of NoopPathVisitor.)"
