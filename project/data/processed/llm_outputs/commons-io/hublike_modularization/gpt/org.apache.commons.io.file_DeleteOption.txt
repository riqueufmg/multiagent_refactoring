    "justification": "DeleteOption has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; DeleteOption does not meet this (outgoing count = 0, incoming count = 1)."
