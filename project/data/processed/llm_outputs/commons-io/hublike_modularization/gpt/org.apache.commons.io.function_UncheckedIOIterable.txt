    "detection": false,
    "justification": "UncheckedIOIterable has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIterable) and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
