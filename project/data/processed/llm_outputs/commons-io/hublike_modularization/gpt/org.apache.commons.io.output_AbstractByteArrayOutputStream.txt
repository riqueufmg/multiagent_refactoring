    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.AbstractByteArrayOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Direct incoming dependencies: 4 distinct classes (DeferredFileOutputStream, DeferredFileOutputStream.Builder, LockableFileWriter, LockableFileWriter.Builder). Direct outgoing dependencies: 4 distinct targets (AbstractByteArrayOutputStream.InputStreamConstructor, org.apache.commons.io.Charsets, org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, org.apache.commons.io.input.ClosedInputStream). These direct coupling counts are small and do not show the large number of both incoming and outgoing connections characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. (Although IOUtils itself lists many dependencies, that is a single direct outgoing dependency from AbstractByteArrayOutputStream, not multiple direct connections.)"
