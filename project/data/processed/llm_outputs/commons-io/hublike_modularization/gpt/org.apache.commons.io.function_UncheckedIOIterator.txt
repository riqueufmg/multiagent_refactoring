    "justification": "UncheckedIOIterator has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIterator and org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; UncheckedIOIterator does not meet this criterion. (Note: Uncheck itself depends on many types, but those are transitive and do not create many direct incoming dependencies on UncheckedIOIterator.)"
