    "justification": "IOTriFunction has only one outgoing dependency (org.apache.commons.io.function.IOFunction) and only two incoming dependents (org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils and org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and outgoing links). Given the provided data (1 outgoing, 2 incoming), IOTriFunction does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
