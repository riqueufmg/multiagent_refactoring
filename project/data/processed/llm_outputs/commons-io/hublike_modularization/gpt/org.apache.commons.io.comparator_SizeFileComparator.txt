    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SizeFileComparator has only one outgoing dependency: org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils, and has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although FileUtils (the single outgoing dependency) itself depends on many classes, SizeFileComparator itself does not have many incoming or outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
