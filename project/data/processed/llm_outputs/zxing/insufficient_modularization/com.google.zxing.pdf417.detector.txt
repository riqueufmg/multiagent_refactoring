It has a large number of fields (nof=13) and a moderate number of methods (nom=9) which, together with the package having only two classes, suggests responsibilities are concentrated rather than decomposed. Dependency usage (ResultPoint, PDF417Reader, BinaryBitmap, BitMatrix, PDF417DetectorResult) and the low number of sibling classes increase the likelihood this class is a bloated abstraction that should be split into smaller, more focused components."
