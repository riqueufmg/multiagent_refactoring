Dependencies include encoder and aztec code types and BitMatrix, indicating it both prepares data and performs encoding/matrix assembly. These characteristics imply concentrated responsibilities and insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes or helper components."

Although it has few declared methods (nom 3), the complexity and breadth of collaborators indicate it orchestrates detection, decoding, error handling and metadata assembly within the same abstraction, suggesting insufficient modularization and opportunities to split responsibilities."
