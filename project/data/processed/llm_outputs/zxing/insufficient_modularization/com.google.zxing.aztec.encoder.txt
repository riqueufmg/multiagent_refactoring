Moderate cohesion (LCOM 0.4) and a broad set of dependencies (BitArray, BitMatrix, ReedSolomon, HighLevelEncoder, AztecWriter, AztecCode) indicate it concentrates multiple responsibilities (high-level encoding, error correction, matrix building). This concentration and size suggest the abstraction is insufficiently modularized."

It interacts closely with State and Encoder and likely encodes multiple concerns (character set handling, state transitions, bitstream construction). Its size and role concentration indicate it would benefit from further decomposition."

It depends on Token and HighLevelEncoder and likely encapsulates multiple aspects of encoder state management and transitions. The concentration of behavior and nontrivial size suggests it should be decomposed or have responsibilities redistributed."
