The class depends on multiple concerns (bit manipulation, error correction with ReedSolomon, format handling, conversion to DecoderResult and CharacterSetECI, and interaction with AztecDetectorResult), indicating concentrated responsibilities. Presence of nested types for small helper results and tables suggests functionality that could be split into smaller, more cohesive classes."
