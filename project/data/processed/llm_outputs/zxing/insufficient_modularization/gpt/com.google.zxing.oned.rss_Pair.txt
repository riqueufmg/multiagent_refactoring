    "justification": "Metrics show a small, low‑complexity class: LOC=17, WMC=4, NOM=4, NOF=2 and DIT=1. LCOM=0.5 indicates acceptable cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show no coupling pressure to split. Given its small size and low complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
