    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: size and complexity are high (LOC=180, WMC=33) while method count and field count are non-trivial (nom=9, nof=11, public methods=4). Cohesion is low (LCOM=0.2222222222222222), indicating responsibilities are not tightly related. With no inheritance decomposition (DIT=0) and these combined metrics, the class appears to bundle multiple concerns and would likely benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more cohesive classes."
