    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.ECIStringBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it declares 12 methods (nom = 12) with 11 public methods (nopm = 11), has a moderate size (loc = 105) and a non-trivial implementation complexity (wmc = 18). The high count of public methods combined with elevated WMC suggests multiple responsibilities or internal complexity that could be split into smaller classes/modules to reduce size and complexity. Although cohesion is not poor (lcom = 0.1667), the number of public entry points and overall complexity justify refactoring into smaller, more focused components. The class has few fields (nof = 3) and only two external dependencies, so decomposition should be feasible in isolation."
