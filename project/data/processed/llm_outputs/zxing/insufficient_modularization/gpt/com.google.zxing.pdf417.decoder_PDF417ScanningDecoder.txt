    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 455) and very high implementation complexity (wmc = 108) indicate the class is doing a lot of work. It has many methods (nom = 25) while exposing very few public methods (nopm = 2), which suggests most logic is implemented internally and could be delegated to smaller focused classes. The class depends on a large number of external types (18 dependencies listed), implying multiple responsibilities or coordination roles. Although LCOM = 0.16 suggests some cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high WMC, many methods, few public methods, and numerous dependencies supports that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
