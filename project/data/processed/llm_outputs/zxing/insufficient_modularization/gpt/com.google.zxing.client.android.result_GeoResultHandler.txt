    "justification": "LCOM=0.8 (high) indicates low cohesion among the class's methods; nom=5 with nopm=5 shows all five methods are public (multiple responsibilities exposed); WMC=7 is a moderate complexity concentrated in a small class surface; although LOC=28 is small, the combination of low cohesion and non-trivial complexity suggests the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split into smaller, more focused classes or helper components."
