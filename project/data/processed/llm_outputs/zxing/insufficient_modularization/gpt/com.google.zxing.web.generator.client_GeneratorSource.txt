    "justification": "Metrics show a small, cohesive class: nom=5, loc=28, wmc=5 indicate low size and complexity; lcom=-1.0 indicates high cohesion; fanin=0 and fanout=0 (only listed dependency: GeneratorException) show minimal coupling. There is no evidence of excessive methods, lines, or complexity that would warrant further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
