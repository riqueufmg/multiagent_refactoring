    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive, not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=74, NOM=7 (NOPM=6), NOF=4 (NOPF=0), WMC=11 (moderate complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). DIT=1 and NC=0 show minimal inheritance/children, and FANIN=0 / FANOUT=0 show no coupling that suggests separable responsibilities. Given the small size, low complexity and strong cohesion, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
