    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: 24 LOC, 2 methods (nom=2), 2 fields (nof=2) and low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=3). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating limited coupling, and there are only 3 external dependencies. Although LCOM=1.0 could suggest low cohesion, with only two methods this is not strong evidence of a need for further decomposition. Overall size, complexity, and coupling metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
