    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=18, NOM=3, NOF=2, WMC=3. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Low coupling/interaction: fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies limited to two types. No inheritance complexity (DIT=0, NC=0). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and well-modularized, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
