    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high number of methods (nom = 21) with many public methods (nopm = 17) and a relatively large number of fields (nof = 10) which together increase its API and internal surface. Its overall size (loc = 123) combined with high complexity (wmc = 38) indicates concentrated implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposing responsibilities. Although cohesion is not very poor (lcom = 0.190476), the method and field counts plus WMC and LOC suggest the class is doing multiple tasks and would benefit from further decomposition. Additional indicators: no inheritance decomposition (dit = 0, nc = 1) so complexity is contained in this single class."
