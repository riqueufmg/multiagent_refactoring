    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=9, nom=2, wmc=2, nof=1, nopm=1, lcom=0.0. Low complexity (WMC=2), very few methods and fields, and perfect cohesion indicate it is already well modularized and does not need further decomposition. Fanout=0 and fanin=0 also show minimal coupling."
