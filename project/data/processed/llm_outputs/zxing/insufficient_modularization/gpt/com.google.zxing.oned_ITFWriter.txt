    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class com.google.zxing.oned.ITFWriter does not show signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=38), very few methods (nom=2, nopm=1), and only modest complexity (WMC=6). Cohesion is high (LCOM=1.0). Although it has 5 fields (NOF=5), the low method count and overall small footprint indicate a compact, focused implementation; there is no clear metric evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
