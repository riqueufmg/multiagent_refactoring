    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code93Writer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected: the class shows signs of insufficient modularization — LOC = 127 and WMC = 27 indicate substantial size and high internal complexity, while NOM = 6 (only 6 methods) and NOPM = 1 (only 1 public method) imply that complexity is concentrated in few/large methods. These metrics together suggest the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce method size and implementation complexity."
