    "justification": "Class has no methods (nom = 0) and only a small number of fields (nof = 3, nopf = 3), very small size (loc = 19) and zero complexity (wmc = 0). Cohesion/complexity indicators do not suggest a large, monolithic implementation (lcom = -1.0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0). No dependencies are present. These elements indicate the class is a small, likely constant/container holder and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
