    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=31, NOM=3, WMC=5. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1). There are no fan-in/fan-out concerns (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics the class does not exhibit the size or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition; dependencies (3 listed) do not by themselves indicate insufficient modularization."
