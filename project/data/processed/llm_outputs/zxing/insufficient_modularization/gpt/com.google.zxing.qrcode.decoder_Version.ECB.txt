    "justification": "Metrics show the class is small and simple: LOC=17, number of fields (nof)=2, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted method count (wmc)=0. Coupling and dependencies are absent (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM=-1.0 and low structural metrics indicate no internal complexity that suggests further decomposition. Based on these elements in isolation, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
