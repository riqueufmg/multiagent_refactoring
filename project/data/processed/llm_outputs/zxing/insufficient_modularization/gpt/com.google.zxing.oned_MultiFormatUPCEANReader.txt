    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: 57 LOC, only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 2 fields (nof=2). LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion, and DIT=1 shows minimal inheritance depth. Although WMC=12 suggests some method complexity, the low method count and small size make further decomposition unlikely to reduce overall complexity. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating low coupling. Taken in isolation, these metrics do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
