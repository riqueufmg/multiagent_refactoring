    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=32 (small size), nom=7 and nof=3 (moderate number of members), WMC=8 (moderate complexity but not high), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate no coupling-driven bloat. Based on these metrics the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
