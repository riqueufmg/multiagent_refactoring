    "justification": "The class is small and focused: LOC=78, nof=4 fields, nom=8 methods. Complexity is moderate and not excessive: WMC=15. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) indicating related responsibilities, and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). These metrics indicate the class is sufficiently modular and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
