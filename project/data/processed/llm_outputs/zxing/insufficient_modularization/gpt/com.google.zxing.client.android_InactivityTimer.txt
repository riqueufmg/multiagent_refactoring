    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows low-to-moderate size and complexity: loc=82, nom=6, nof=6 and WMC=9 (not excessively high). High cohesion is indicated by LCOM=0.0. The class already contains focused inner components (InactivityAsyncTask, PowerStatusReceiver) suggesting separation of responsibilities. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating limited coupling and a self-contained design. Given these metrics and embedded helper classes, there is no clear evidence the class is insufficiently modularized."
