    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small (LOC=73) with a moderate number of methods (NOM=10, public methods=5). Complexity (WMC=15) is not excessively high for the method count, and cohesion is high (LCOM=0.2), indicating related responsibilities rather than a mixed set of unrelated functions. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, showing it is not a highly coupled god object in the provided isolated context. Although there are external dependencies listed, the internal metrics (size, cohesion, and moderate complexity) do not justify identifying Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
