    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization. The class is small (loc=50) with moderate complexity (wmc=12) and many small methods (nom=12) which suggests decomposition into many tiny helpers rather than a large monolith. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). Coupling and impact are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=0). Field count is moderate (nof=6) and only one public method (nopm=1), indicating a narrow external interface. These elements together argue against further decomposition."
