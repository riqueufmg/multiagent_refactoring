    "class": "com.google.zxing.integration.android.IntentIntegrator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and complex in isolation: LOC = 325, number of methods (nom) = 34, weighted method count (wmc) = 61, number of fields (nof) = 24 (nopf = 12). These values indicate substantial implementation size and complexity concentrated in a single class. Although LCOM = 0.0588 suggests the class is cohesive, the combination of high LOC, many methods and fields, and high WMC implies the class likely groups multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
