    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and a small size (loc=58), indicating limited scope. LCOM = -1.0 implies high cohesion, and fanin/fanout = 0 show no coupling pressure to split. Although WMC = 12 shows some internal complexity, with only two methods that complexity is localized and does not by itself justify further decomposition. Therefore there is no clear evidence of insufficient modularization."
