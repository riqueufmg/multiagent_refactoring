    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large (LOC=529) with high implementation complexity (WMC=112), many methods (NOM=29) and many fields (NOF=25) and a sizeable public API (NOPM=12). It depends on a wide variety of unrelated components (camera, decoding, UI/viewfinder, clipboard, history, ambient light, beep manager, timers, preferences, intent/result handling — e.g. CameraManager, DecodeFormatManager, ViewfinderView, ClipboardInterface, HistoryManager, AmbientLightManager, BeepManager, InactivityTimer, PreferencesActivity, ResultHandlerFactory, etc.), indicating multiple responsibilities. Although LCOM is low (0.103), the class size, high complexity, number of fields/methods and breadth of dependencies justify decomposing it into smaller, focused classes/modules to reduce size and complexity."
