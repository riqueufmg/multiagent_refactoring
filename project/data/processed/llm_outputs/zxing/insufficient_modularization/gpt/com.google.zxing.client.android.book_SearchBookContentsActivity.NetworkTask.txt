    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.book.SearchBookContentsActivity.NetworkTask",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large size (loc = 94) while reporting no decomposed members (nom = 0, nof = 0, nopf = 0) and no measured complexity per-method (wmc = 0). This combination (large LOC with zero methods/fields) indicates behavior concentrated in a single unit rather than decomposed into smaller methods/classes. Low/invalid cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) and an external dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.HttpHelper) further suggest multiple responsibilities that could be extracted. These elements justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
