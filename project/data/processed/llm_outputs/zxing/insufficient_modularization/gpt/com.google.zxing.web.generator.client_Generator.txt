    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is moderately large and complex: loc=194, wmc=18, nom=14 and nof=14. It exposes nopm=5 public methods while still containing 9 additional non-public methods, indicating many internal responsibilities. The combination of high field count and method count (14 fields, 14 methods) with substantial LOC suggests the class has multiple responsibilities that could be split to reduce size and complexity (i.e., insufficient modularization)."
