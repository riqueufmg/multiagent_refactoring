    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MinimalEncoder.ResultNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows low internal complexity and size: LOC=79, WMC=0, NOM=0, and only 4 fields (NOF=4). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single external dependency on com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Mode). With no methods and low complexity metrics there is no evidence the class is a large monolithic component that would benefit from further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
