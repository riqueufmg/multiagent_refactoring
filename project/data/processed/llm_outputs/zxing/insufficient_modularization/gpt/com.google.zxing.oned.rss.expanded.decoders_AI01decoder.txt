    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=41), few methods (NOM=4), modest complexity (WMC=9) for the method count, shallow inheritance (DIT=1), acceptable cohesion (LCOM=0.5), and very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency). These elements suggest the class is not overly large or complex and does not require further decomposition in isolation."
