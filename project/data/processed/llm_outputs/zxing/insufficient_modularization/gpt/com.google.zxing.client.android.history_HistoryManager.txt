    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.history.HistoryManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: size and complexity are high (LOC=200, WMC=24) with many operations (NOM=13) and multiple public/private methods (NOPM=8). It depends on a range of conceptually different collaborators (DBHelper, PreferencesActivity, ResultHandler, Result, HistoryItem, BarcodeFormat, Intents), suggesting it handles persistence, preferences/intents, result processing and format concerns. Although cohesion metric (LCOM=0.0) is good, the combination of high LOC, high complexity and diverse dependencies indicates the class groups multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
