    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is very small (loc=17), has only two fields (nof=2), contains no methods (nom=0) and no measurable complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0). Considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
