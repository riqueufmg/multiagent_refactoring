    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Decoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: moderate-to-low cohesion (LCOM = 0.5) together with non-trivial implementation complexity (LOC = 77, WMC = 9) indicates multiple responsibilities in a single class. Although it has a small number of methods (nom = 4, nopm = 3) and one field (nof = 1), the dependency set is large and heterogeneous (Version, BitMatrix, BitMatrixParser, DataBlock, DecodedBitStreamParser, ReedSolomonDecoder/GenericGF, DecoderResult, ChecksumException), implying the class handles parsing, error-correction, bitstream decoding and result construction. These factors justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
