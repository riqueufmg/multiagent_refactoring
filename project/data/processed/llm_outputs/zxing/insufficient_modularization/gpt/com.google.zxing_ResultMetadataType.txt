    "class": "com.google.zxing.ResultMetadataType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no internal structure to decompose: number of fields (nof)=0, number of methods (nom)=0, number of public fields/methods (nopf/nopm)=0. Complexity metrics are nil (wmc=0), coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0), and there are no dependencies. LOC=47 alone does not indicate a need for further decomposition when there are no methods or fields; lcom=-1.0 is not indicative of decomposable cohesion here. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
