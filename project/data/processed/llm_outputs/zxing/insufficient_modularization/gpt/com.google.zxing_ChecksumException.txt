    "class": "com.google.zxing.ChecksumException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple (loc=21, wmc=4) with only a few methods (nom=4, nopm=2) and a single field (nof=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and the inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). Although LCOM=0.75 suggests some lack of cohesion, the overall size and low complexity do not indicate that further decomposition would meaningfully reduce complexity or size. Therefore this class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
