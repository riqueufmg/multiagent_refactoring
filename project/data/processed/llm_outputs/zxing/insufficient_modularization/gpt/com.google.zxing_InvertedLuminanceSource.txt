    "class": "com.google.zxing.InvertedLuminanceSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=49, NOM=9, WMC=11 and LCOM=0.0 indicate modest complexity with high cohesion. It has a single field (NOF=1, NOPF=0) and no coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0). With only one external dependency (com.google.zxing.LuminanceSource) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1), there is no strong evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or needs further decomposition."
