    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics show signs of insufficient modularization: WMC = 17 (relatively high complexity concentrated in this class), LOC = 86 and NOM = 6 (multiple methods in a small class footprint), NOF = 1 together with LCOM = 0.333 (methods are not fully cohesive and likely implement more than one responsibility while sharing few fields), and DIT = 0 / fanin = 0 / fanout = 0 (the class is implemented as a standalone unit rather than composed). The class also depends on two external utilities (com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Common and com.google.zxing.common.detector.MathUtils), suggesting it mixes decoding logic and utility/algorithm code. These elements together indicate the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
