    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=41), very low complexity (wmc=1), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), only one method (nom=1) and no fanout (fanout=0). Although it has 5 fields, the low LOC/WMC and high cohesion indicate it does not need further decomposition based on the provided metrics and dependencies."
