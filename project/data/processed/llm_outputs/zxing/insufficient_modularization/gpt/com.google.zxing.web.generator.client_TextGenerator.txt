    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=47, NOM=8, WMC=11 (moderate complexity), LCOM=0.375 (good cohesion). It has only 2 fields, no nested classes (nc=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and no external coupling shown (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 2 dependencies). These metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition."
