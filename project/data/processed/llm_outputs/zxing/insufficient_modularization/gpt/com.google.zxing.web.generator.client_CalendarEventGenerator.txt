    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.CalendarEventGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 235), high implementation complexity (wmc = 41), and many methods (nom = 21 with nopm = 10) and fields (nof = 14). These values indicate the class likely contains multiple responsibilities or implementation areas that could be split. Although LCOM is low (0.095) indicating reasonable cohesion, the combination of high LOC, WMC, and method/field counts supports refactoring/decomposition. Additional contextual indicators: shallow inheritance (dit = 1) and no fan-in/fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) suggest the class is relatively self-contained and large, reinforcing the need to consider splitting it into smaller modules."
