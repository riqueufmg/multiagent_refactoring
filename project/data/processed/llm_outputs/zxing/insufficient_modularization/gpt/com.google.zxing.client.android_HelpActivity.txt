    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=30, NOM=3, WMC=5 (low complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). There are no public fields (NOPF=0), low public methods (NOPM=1), no inheritance (DIT=0, NC=0) and no coupling shown (fanin=0, fanout=0). These values do not suggest the class is insufficiently modularized or in need of further decomposition."
