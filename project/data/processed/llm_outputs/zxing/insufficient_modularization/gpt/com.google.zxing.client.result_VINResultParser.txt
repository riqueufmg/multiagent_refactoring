    "justification": "High internal complexity and size concentrated in a single class: WMC = 54 (very high cyclomatic complexity), LOC = 153 (large class), NOM = 7 (few methods with high average complexity), NOF = 2 (small state but many behaviors), NOPM = 1 (only one public method exposing functionality), DIT = 1 (no inheritance depth to distribute behavior). Although LCOM = 0.0 indicates cohesion, the combination of high WMC and large LOC shows the class is doing substantial work that could be decomposed into smaller modules (parsing/validation/formatting responsibilities) to reduce implementation complexity and class size."
