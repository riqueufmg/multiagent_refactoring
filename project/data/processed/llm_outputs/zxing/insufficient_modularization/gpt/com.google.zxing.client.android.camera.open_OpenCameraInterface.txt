    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: loc=51, nom=2, nof=2, nopm=1. Although wmc=9 shows some method complexity, the class has few methods and fields and LCOM=1.0 (cohesive). Fanout=0 and only two dependencies listed suggest limited responsibilities. Overall size and cohesion do not indicate a need for further decomposition."
