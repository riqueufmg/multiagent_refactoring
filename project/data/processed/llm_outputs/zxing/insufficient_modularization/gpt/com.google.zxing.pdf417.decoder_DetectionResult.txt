    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size and complexity: LOC=238 and WMC=61 indicate substantial implementation complexity and a large class body. Structure shows many implementation elements: NOM=19 methods with only NOPM=1 public API method and NOF=5 fields, implying many internal behaviors. The class depends on multiple domain types (BoundingBox, Codeword, BarcodeMetadata, PDF417Common, DetectionResultColumn), suggesting it aggregates multiple responsibilities. DIT=0 and NC=0 show a flat inheritance role, so decomposition (introducing smaller classes/modules) could reduce size and complexity. Despite LCOM=0.0 (cohesion), the high LOC/WMC and method count justify detection of Insufficient Modularization."
