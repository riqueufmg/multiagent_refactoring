    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=42), modest complexity (wmc=7) and few methods (nom=6), zero public fields (nopf=0) and low coupling (fanout=0). High cohesion (lcom=0.0) indicates responsibilities are well-focused. Considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence that it should be further decomposed."
