    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=49, NOM=3 (only 3 methods), NOPM=2. Complexity is moderate but not excessive: WMC=10 (≈3.3 per method). Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0) and coupling low (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only two explicit dependencies. DIT=1 indicates minimal inheritance depth. Given the small size, low method count, high cohesion and low coupling, there is no clear evidence that further decomposition is needed."
