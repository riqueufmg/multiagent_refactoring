    "justification": "WMC=27 and LOC=161 indicate high implementation complexity and size for a single class; NOM=9 with only NOPM=3 shows many non-public methods (internal functionality) that may represent multiple responsibilities; LCOM=0.333 (moderate cohesion) does not preclude further decomposition; NOF=1 together with the above suggests functionality is concentrated in this class and it could be split to reduce complexity."
