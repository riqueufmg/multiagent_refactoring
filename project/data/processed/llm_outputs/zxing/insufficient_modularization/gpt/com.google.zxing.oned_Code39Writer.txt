    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code39Writer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=104 and WMC=26 indicate substantial size and high implementation complexity, while NOM=4 and NOPM=1 show that few methods (one public method) are shouldering that complexity. Average complexity per method is high (~6.5), implying large/complex method bodies that could be decomposed. DIT=1 and fanin/fanout=0 do not mitigate the internal complexity. These elements together justify that the class should be further decomposed."
