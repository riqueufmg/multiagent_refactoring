    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class size and complexity do not indicate missing decomposition: LOC=118 and NOM=12 are moderate, and WMC=20 does not show excessive cyclomatic complexity. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.1667), suggesting a single well-defined responsibility. Although there are several fields (NOF=15, NOPF=8), these can represent configuration/constants typical for a finite field implementation rather than separate responsibilities. The class has no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency (GenericGFPoly), consistent with an isolated, cohesive unit. Therefore there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
