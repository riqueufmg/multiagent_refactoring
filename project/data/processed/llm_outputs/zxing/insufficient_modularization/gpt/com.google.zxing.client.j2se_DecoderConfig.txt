    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecoderConfig",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class holds a high number of fields (nof = 13) while exposing very little behavior (nom = 1, nopm = 0). LOC is small (33) and WMC is low (5), indicating a concentration of state without corresponding modularized behavior. This pattern (many attributes, few methods) suggests the class is acting as a large data/configuration holder that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity. Dependencies on multiple configuration-related types (com.google.zxing.DecodeHintType, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat) further indicate multiple concerns that could be separated."
