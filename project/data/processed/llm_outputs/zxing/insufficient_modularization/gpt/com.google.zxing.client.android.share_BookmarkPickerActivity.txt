    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=35, WMC=4, NOM=2, NOF=5. Low complexity and few methods reduce need for decomposition. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show low coupling. DIT=0 (no inheritance). These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
