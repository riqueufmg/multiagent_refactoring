    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.QRCodeDecoderMetaData",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=28, WMC=4, NOM=3, NOPM=2, NOF=1 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low complexity and high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on com.google.zxing.ResultPoint). Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence it should be further decomposed."
