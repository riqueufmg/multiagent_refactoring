    "justification": "Class is small and trivially decomposed: LOC=15, no methods (nom=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), cyclomatic/complexity is zero (wmc=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
