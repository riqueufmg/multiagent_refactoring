    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.ResultHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc=361), high method count (nom=43) and many fields (nof=13) indicate substantial responsibilities bundled in one class; high cyclomatic/maintenance complexity (wmc=80) shows complex internal logic that would benefit from decomposition; non-trivial public interface surface (nopm=9) increases coupling for clients; dependencies on multiple collaborators (listed dependencies: PreferencesActivity, Contents, Result, ParsedResult, ResultParser, LocaleManager, Intents) suggest varied responsibilities. Although cohesion metric (lcom=0.186) is not high, the combination of size, method/field counts, and complexity justifies refactoring the class into smaller, focused modules."
