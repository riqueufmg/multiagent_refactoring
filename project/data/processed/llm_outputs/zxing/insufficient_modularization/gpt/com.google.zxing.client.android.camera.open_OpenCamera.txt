    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=27, NOM=5, WMC=5, NOF=4 and LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). There is no inheritance (DIT=0, NC=0) and no interaction pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition in isolation."
