    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=76, NOM=8, NOF=4. Although WMC=16 shows some method complexity, LCOM=0.25 indicates good cohesion (methods share state) so functionality is well grouped. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 show low coupling to other classes. Given the modest size and good cohesion, there is no clear evidence that further decomposition is required."
