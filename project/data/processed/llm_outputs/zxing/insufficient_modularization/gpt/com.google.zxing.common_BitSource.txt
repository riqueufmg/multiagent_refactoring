    "justification": "LOC=71 and WMC=11 indicate moderate size and relatively high internal complexity for a small class (NOM=5). NOF=3 shows some state to manage. Although LCOM=0.0 indicates good cohesion, the combination of relatively high WMC with few methods suggests individual methods are complex and the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity — therefore insufficient modularization is detected."
