    "justification": "Metrics show 12 fields (nof=12, nopf=12) but only 48 LOC (loc=48) and very low complexity (wmc=1). The class has a single method (nom=1), zero inheritance depth (dit=0), high cohesion (lcom=0.0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). This profile matches a small constants/utility holder rather than a large undecomposed class, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
