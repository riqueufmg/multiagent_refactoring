    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=21, WMC=4, NOM=4, NOF=2. Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5). No external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency. These metrics do not indicate a large, complex, or low-cohesion class that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
