    "justification": "Class has moderate size (loc=99) and method count (nom=14) with moderate complexity (wmc=19) but very high cohesion (lcom=0.0). Field count is modest (nof=7), inheritance depth is minimal (dit=0), and coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=3). Given the small-to-moderate size, high cohesion, and limited coupling, there is no strong indication that the class has not been fully decomposed — insufficient modularization is not detected."
