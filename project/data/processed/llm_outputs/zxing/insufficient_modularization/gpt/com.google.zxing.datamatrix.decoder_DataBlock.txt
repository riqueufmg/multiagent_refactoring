    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=67) with few members (nom=4 methods, nof=2 fields), high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), and limited external coupling (single dependency). Although WMC=13 shows some method complexity, the class is small and cohesive, so there is no clear evidence that it needs further decomposition."
