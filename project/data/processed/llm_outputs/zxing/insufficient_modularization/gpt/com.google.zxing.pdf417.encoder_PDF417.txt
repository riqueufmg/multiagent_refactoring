    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.PDF417",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: LOC=234 (large size for a single class); WMC=31 (high cyclomatic/implementation complexity); NOM=14 methods with NOPM=9 public methods (broad interface / many responsibilities); NOF=14 fields (substantial internal state). It also depends on multiple collaborator classes (PDF417ErrorCorrection, Compaction, BarcodeMatrix, PDF417HighLevelEncoder, BarcodeRow), indicating it coordinates several concerns. Although LCOM=0.1428 indicates reasonable cohesion, the combined size (LOC), complexity (WMC) and number of fields/methods suggest the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
