    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.wifi.NetworkType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has only one method (nom = 1) yet a high complexity score (wmc = 7) and concentrated size (loc = 13), indicating significant behavior is implemented in a single method instead of being decomposed. The absence of external interactions (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) means the complexity is internal to this class. These elements together suggest the class is insufficiently modular and could be decomposed to reduce method complexity and class size."
