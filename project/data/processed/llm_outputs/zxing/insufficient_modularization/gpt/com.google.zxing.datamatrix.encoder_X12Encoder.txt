    "justification": "WMC = 15 with only nom = 4 (high average complexity per method) and loc = 58 indicates complex, concentrated implementation that could be split; nopm = 2 (few public entry points) combined with relatively high implementation complexity suggests internal methods/logic are large and a candidate for decomposition; small number of dependencies (2) implies the class carries responsibilities rather than delegating them. These factors together point to insufficient modularization."
