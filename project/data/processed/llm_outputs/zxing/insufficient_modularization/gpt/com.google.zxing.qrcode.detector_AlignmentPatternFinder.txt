    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.AlignmentPatternFinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=195) combined with high complexity (wmc=33) while exposing a small number of methods (nom=6) — suggesting few, large/complex methods rather than many focused ones. It also has a non-trivial number of fields (nof=9), indicating mixed state and behavior that could be split. The class depends on multiple distinct concerns (com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, AlignmentPattern, ResultPointCallback, NotFoundException), implying it handles scanning/analysis, pattern construction, and callback/exception logic in one unit. These elements (high LOC, high WMC, low NOM, multiple dependencies) justify flagging insufficient modularization and recommend decomposing responsibilities into smaller classes or helper/extractor methods."
