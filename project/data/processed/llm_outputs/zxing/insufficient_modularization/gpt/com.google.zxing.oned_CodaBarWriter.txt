    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of Insufficient Modularization: low number of methods (nom = 2, nopm = 1) combined with high complexity (wmc = 22) and substantial size (loc = 99) — suggesting complexity is concentrated in a few large methods that could be decomposed. LCOM = 1.0 indicates low cohesion, implying the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that are not well related. The class is isolated (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), so extracting smaller modules would reduce implementation complexity with limited coupling impact. These metrics together justify that further decomposition is warranted."
