    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=34, number of methods=2, WMC=5. It has a single field (nof=1), no inheritance (DIT=0), no external coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a limited set of dependencies. Although LCOM=1.0 suggests the two methods do not share many instance details, the overall size and low complexity indicate no clear need for further decomposition in isolation."
