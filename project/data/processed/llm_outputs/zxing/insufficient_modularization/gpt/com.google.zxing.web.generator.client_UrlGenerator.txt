    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.UrlGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=43), limited surface (nom=7, nopm=6), low-to-moderate complexity (wmc=9), few fields (nof=2), good cohesion (lcom=0.2857), minimal inheritance depth (dit=1), and no external coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics suggest the class is small, focused and sufficiently decomposed; no clear need for further decomposition."
