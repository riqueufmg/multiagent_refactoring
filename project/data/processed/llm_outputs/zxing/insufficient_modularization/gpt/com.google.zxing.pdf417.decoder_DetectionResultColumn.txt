    "justification": "Class has modest size and method count (loc=63, nom=8, nof=3), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=2), and high cohesion (lcom=0.0). Although WMC is somewhat elevated (wmc=16), the small LOC/nom and strong cohesion do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large responsibility — no evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
