    "class": "com.google.zxing.LuminanceSource",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected as Insufficient Modularization because the class has a relatively large size and complexity (loc=105, WMC=17) and a high number of methods (nom=12, nopm=11) suggesting multiple responsibilities. Cohesion is moderate/low (LCOM=0.583), indicating methods are not strongly related. The class also has few fields (nof=2) while exposing many public methods, which often signals mixed responsibilities that could be split into smaller, more focused classes. These metrics together justify further decomposition."
