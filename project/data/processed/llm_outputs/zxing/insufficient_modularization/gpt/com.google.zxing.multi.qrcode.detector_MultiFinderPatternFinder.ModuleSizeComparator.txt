    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and simple: LOC=9, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies. Low size (LOC) and zero methods/complexity mean there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; cohesion metric is not meaningful here (LCOM=-1). Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
