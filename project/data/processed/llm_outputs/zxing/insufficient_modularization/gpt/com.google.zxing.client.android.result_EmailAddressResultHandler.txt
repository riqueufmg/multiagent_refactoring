    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.EmailAddressResultHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LCOM=0.8 (low cohesion) indicates the methods are not strongly related; WMC=7 shows moderate complexity concentrated in this class; NOM=5 with LOC=28 means multiple methods could represent separate responsibilities despite small size; NOF=1 (single field) plus NC=0 and FANIN/FANOUT=0 imply the class holds internal, potentially separable behavior rather than shared infrastructure; dependencies on com.google.zxing.client.result.EmailAddressParsedResult and ParsedResult suggest the class mixes handling of parsed results with result-specific logic. Together these elements point to insufficient modularization and the opportunity to decompose the class into more focused units."
