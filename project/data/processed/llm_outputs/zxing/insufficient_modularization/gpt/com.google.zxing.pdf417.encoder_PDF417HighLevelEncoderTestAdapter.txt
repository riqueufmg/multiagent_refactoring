    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, simple class: loc=10, nom=2, wmc=2 (low complexity), nopm=1, fanin=0, fanout=0, and LCOM=-1.0 (indicating high cohesion). There are only two dependencies listed. Given the low size, low complexity, few methods, and high cohesion, there is no evidence this class needs further decomposition."
