    "justification": "Metrics show a class that concentrates complexity in few routines: LOC=109 with only NOM=3 methods (NOPM=1 public), producing large methods rather than smaller decomposed ones. High WMC=18 (average complexity ~6 per method) indicates complex method bodies that could be split. LCOM=0.6667 indicates relatively low cohesion, suggesting mixed responsibilities that should be separated. NOF=5 fields combined with few methods further suggests state/behavior are not well-distributed. Given these values (LOC, WMC, NOM, LCOM, NOF) the class appears insufficiently modularized and would benefit from decomposition."
