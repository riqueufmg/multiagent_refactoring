    "justification": "Not detected. The class is small and simple: 50 LOC, 5 methods (4 public) and a low complexity (WMC = 6). LCOM = -1.0 indicates high cohesion rather than a mix of unrelated responsibilities. There is no evidence of large public API surface or high complexity that would suggest further decomposition (fan-in and fan-out are 0). Based on these metrics considered in isolation, there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
