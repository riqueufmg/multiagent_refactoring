    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: 19 LOC, 2 methods (nom=2) and WMC=2 indicate low complexity and little implementation to decompose. It has a single field (nof=1) and no coupling to or from other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0) aside from one dependency (BitArray). With this minimal size and functionality, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
