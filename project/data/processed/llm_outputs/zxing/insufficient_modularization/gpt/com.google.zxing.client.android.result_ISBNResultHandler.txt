    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.ISBNResultHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LCOM=0.8 indicates low cohesion (methods do not share state). NOM=5 with WMC=9 shows a non-trivial amount of complexity spread across a small set of methods. NOF=1 (few fields) combined with the high LCOM implies methods operate largely independently and could be separated. LOC=32 is small but WMC=9 means complexity is concentrated rather than proportional to size. DIT=1 (shallow inheritance) does not explain the responsibilities, and the class depends on multiple types (Result, ParsedResult, ISBNParsedResult), suggesting it handles multiple concerns. These factors together support that the class is insufficiently modular and could be decomposed further."
