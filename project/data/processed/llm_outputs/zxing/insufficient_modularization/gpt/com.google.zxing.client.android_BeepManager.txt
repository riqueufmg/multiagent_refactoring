    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization. The class is small (loc=78) with a moderate number of methods (nom=7) and fields (nof=7). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), there is no inheritance depth (dit=0), and no external coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although cyclomatic complexity is somewhat elevated (wmc=14), it is not paired with large size or low cohesion that would justify further decomposition. Public surface is limited (nopm=2, nopf=0), so there is no clear evidence the class mixes multiple responsibilities or needs additional modularization."
