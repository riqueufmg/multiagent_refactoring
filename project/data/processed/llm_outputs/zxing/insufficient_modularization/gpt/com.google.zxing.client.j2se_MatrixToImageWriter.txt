    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.MatrixToImageWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=111), modest complexity (wmc=13), moderate number of methods (nom=9, nopm=8), and good cohesion (lcom=0.222). There is no evidence of excessive coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) within the provided data. Given these metrics, the class is reasonably sized, cohesive, and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not indicated."
