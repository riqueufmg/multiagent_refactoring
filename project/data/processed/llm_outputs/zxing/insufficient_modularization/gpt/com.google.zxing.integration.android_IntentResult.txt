    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class is small (LOC=55) with a modest complexity (WMC=8) and a limited surface (NOM=8, NOF=5, NOPM=6). Cohesion is good (LCOM=0.25), suggesting related responsibilities, and there is no coupling via dependencies or inheritance (fanin=0, fanout=0, DIT=0). Given these measures, further decomposition is not justified when considering the class in isolation."
