    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and self-contained: LOC=23, number of methods=4, WMC=6 (low complexity). Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single external dependency: com.google.zxing.common.BitArray). DIT=2 indicates simple inheritance but does not imply excessive size or complexity. Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large, or complex class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
