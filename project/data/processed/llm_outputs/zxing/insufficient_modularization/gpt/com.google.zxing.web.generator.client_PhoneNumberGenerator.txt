    "justification": "Class shows no sign of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=46), small number of fields (nof=2) and methods (nom=7, nopm=6), moderate complexity (wmc=10) but not excessive, good cohesion (lcom=0.2857), shallow inheritance (dit=1) and no subclasses (nc=0), and no coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is reasonably cohesive and not large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
