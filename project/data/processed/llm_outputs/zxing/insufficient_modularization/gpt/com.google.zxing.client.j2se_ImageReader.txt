    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=38, NOM=3 (NOPM=2), NOF=1, WMC=7. It has no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LCOM=0.666 indicates moderate cohesion concerns, the overall size and complexity are low, so further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or implementation complexity; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
