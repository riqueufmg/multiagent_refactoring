    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method and field counts (nom=19 methods, nof=17 fields) and many public methods (nopm=19) indicate multiple responsibilities exposed from the same class. Complexity is non-trivial (WMC=20) and size is moderate (LOC=113), while shallow inheritance (DIT=1) does not mitigate the internal complexity. Although LCOM=0.0 suggests good cohesion, the combination of many fields, many methods, and high complexity supports decomposing the class into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
