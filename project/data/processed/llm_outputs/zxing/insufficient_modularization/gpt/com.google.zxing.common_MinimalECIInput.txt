    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.MinimalECIInput",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 243) and high complexity (wmc = 48) indicate substantial implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposition. It also exposes many operations (nom = 13, nopm = 10) which suggests multiple responsibilities or a surface that could be split into smaller classes. Although cohesion (lcom = 0.0) is low numerically, the combination of high LOC and WMC is the stronger indicator that the class has not been fully decomposed. The class has only a couple of dependencies (com.google.zxing.common.ECIEncoderSet and its inner InputEdge), which implies decomposition is feasible without heavy coupling to other components."
