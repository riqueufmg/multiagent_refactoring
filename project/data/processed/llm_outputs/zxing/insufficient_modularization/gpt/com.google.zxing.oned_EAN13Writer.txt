    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, focused class: LOC=54, NOM=2, NOF=1 and only 1 public method (NOPM=1). Cyclomatic/weight metric WMC=8 is moderate but not large given the low method count. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show it is isolated; DIT=2 reflects simple inheritance. Although LCOM=1.0 could suggest low cohesion, the class has only two methods and one field, so further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity. Therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
