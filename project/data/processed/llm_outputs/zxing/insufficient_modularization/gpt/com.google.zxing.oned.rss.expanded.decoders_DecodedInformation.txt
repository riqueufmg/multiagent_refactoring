    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=30), low complexity (wmc=5), small number of methods (nom=5) and fields (nof=3). High cohesion (lcom=0.0) suggests methods are related, and shallow inheritance (dit=1) with no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) gives no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
