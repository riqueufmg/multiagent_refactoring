    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=14, NOM=3, WMC=3. It has no incoming/outgoing coupling in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one external dependency (com.google.zxing.common.BitArray). LCOM indicates cohesion is not a problem (lcom=-1.0 in the provided metrics). Although DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, there is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or low cohesion that would indicate it has not been decomposed; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
