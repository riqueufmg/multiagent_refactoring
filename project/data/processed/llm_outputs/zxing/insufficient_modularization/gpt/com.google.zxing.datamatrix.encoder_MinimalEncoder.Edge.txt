    "justification": "Insufficient modularization detected because the class is very large (loc = 338) while having many fields (nof = 9) but no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0). This combination indicates a large, undecomposed unit that likely mixes responsibilities or bulky data/logic and would benefit from further decomposition. Supporting metrics: loc=338, nof=9, nom=0, wmc=0, lcom=-1.0."
