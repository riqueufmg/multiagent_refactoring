    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.BitArrayBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (nom = 2) but a relatively high complexity (wmc = 11) and moderate size (loc = 45). This combination indicates that functionality is concentrated in few, complex methods rather than decomposed across more methods or smaller helper classes — a hallmark of Insufficient Modularization. The presence of only two external dependencies and a negative LCOM (lcom = -1.0) does not negate the evidence that complexity is concentrated inside the class: high WMC with low NOM suggests internal implementation could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
