    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=9, 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), WMC=1 indicating minimal complexity, no fields (nof=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and DIT=0. These metrics indicate a minimal exception/support class with single responsibility, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
