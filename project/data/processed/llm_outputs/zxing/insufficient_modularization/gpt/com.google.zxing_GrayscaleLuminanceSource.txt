    "justification": "No: the class does not show clear signs of insufficient modularization. Metrics: loc=89 and nom=8 indicate a small-to-moderate size; wmc=16 is not extremely high; lcom=0.375 indicates acceptable cohesion (methods are related); nof=5 and nopm=7 do not indicate an excessive number of responsibilities in isolation. dit=1 and fanin/fanout=0 show limited inheritance/coupling. Taken in isolation, these elements do not justify further decomposition."
