    "justification": "Class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc=106) combined with high complexity (wmc=21) while exposing few methods (nom=5, nopm=2) and only 2 fields (nof=2). The high WMC relative to low NOM indicates large/complex method implementations that could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. (lcom=0.0 shows cohesion but does not negate the high per-method complexity and overall size.)"
