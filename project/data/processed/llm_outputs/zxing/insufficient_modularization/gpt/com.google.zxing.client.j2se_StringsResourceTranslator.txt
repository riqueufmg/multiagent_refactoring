    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=138 (relatively large); WMC=20 (high implementation complexity); nof=7 fields with nom=6 methods and nopm=1 (many fields relative to publicly exposed behavior, suggesting internal helper logic/state); LCOM=0.333 (only moderate cohesion); dit=0 and fanin=0/fanout=0 (isolated, so decomposition is feasible). These elements together indicate the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
