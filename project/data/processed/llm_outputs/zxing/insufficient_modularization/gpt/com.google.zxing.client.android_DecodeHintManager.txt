    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modularized: LOC = 162 while NOM = 4 and NOF = 2 (very few methods/fields for the size), implying large/monolithic methods (avg ~40 LOC/method). WMC = 32 indicates high implementation complexity concentrated in few methods. LCOM = 0.5 (moderate cohesion) suggests responsibilities are not clearly separated. Fanin = 0 and Fanout = 0 imply the class is self-contained and likely holds multiple responsibilities internally. These metrics together justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
