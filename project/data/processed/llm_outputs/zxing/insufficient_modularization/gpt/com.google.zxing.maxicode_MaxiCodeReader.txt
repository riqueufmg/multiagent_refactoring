    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and focused: LOC=56, number of methods=4, WMC=9 (moderate complexity), number of fields=4. Cohesion is acceptable (LCOM=0.5) and there are no external coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the limited size and moderate complexity, there is no evidence that this class requires further decomposition."
