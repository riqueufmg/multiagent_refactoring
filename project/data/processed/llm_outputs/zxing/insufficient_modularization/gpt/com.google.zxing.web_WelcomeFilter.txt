    "justification": "Class is very small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=8, number of methods=1 (nom=1), no fields (nof=0), low complexity (WMC=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and low inheritance depth (DIT=1). LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion. These metrics show the class is already minimal and cohesive, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
