    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class in isolation: low size (LOC=61), small number of fields (NOF=3), moderate number of methods (NOM=10) with all public (NOPM=10) but high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Although WMC=15 shows some complexity, the class is compact and highly cohesive, and there are no coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0) that would suggest splitting responsibilities into separate modules would reduce complexity or size."
