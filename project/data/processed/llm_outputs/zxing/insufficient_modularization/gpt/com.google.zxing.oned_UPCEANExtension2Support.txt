    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=62, number of methods (nom)=3, number of fields (nof)=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Although WMC=11 indicates some internal complexity, with only 3 methods the average complexity per method is moderate and does not by itself justify further decomposition. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=0). Based on these metrics in isolation, the class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
