    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC is small (65), NOM is moderate (8) and WMC is moderate (14) — the class is not large or overly complex. LCOM = 0.25 indicates reasonable cohesion, DIT = 1 shows no deep inheritance, and fan-in/fan-out are 0 (low coupling in the provided context). No public fields (NOPF = 0). Given these elements, there is no strong evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
