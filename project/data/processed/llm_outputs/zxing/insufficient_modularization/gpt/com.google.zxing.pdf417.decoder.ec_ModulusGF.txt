    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class. LOC is modest (75), NOM is moderate (11) and WMC (18) is not excessively high for this size. LCOM = 0.0 indicates high cohesion among methods, and there is no evidence of excessive coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0 in the provided metrics). Only two dependencies are listed. Taken in isolation, these elements do not support the Insufficient Modularization smell."
