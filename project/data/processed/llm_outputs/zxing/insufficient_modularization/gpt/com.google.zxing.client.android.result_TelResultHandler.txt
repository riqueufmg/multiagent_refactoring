    "justification": "High lack of cohesion (LCOM=0.8333333333333334) combined with multiple public methods (nom=6, nopm=6) and non-trivial complexity (WMC=8) indicates the class groups multiple responsibilities. Although the class is not large (LOC=36) and has a single field (NOF=1), the low cohesion of its methods suggests it has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from extracting responsibilities into separate classes or modules."
