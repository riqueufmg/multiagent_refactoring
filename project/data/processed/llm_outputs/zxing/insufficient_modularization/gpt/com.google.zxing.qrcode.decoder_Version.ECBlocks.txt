    "justification": "Class analyzed in isolation shows no signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=27), very low complexity (wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods (nom=0), no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), and high cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0). These metrics indicate the class is already small and simple and does not require further decomposition."
