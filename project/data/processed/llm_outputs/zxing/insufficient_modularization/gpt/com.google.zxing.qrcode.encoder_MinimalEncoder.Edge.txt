    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation: small size (loc=34), zero methods (nom=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) indicate the class is not large or complex; coupling is low (fanout=0, single dependency on com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Mode); although it has 6 fields (nof=6), the overall metrics do not indicate a class that must be further decomposed."
