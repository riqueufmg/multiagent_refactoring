    "justification": "LCOM = 0.75 (low cohesion) indicates the class's methods are not closely related and the class likely has multiple responsibilities; NOM = 4 with NOPM = 3 (multiple public operations) shows several distinct behaviors exposed; WMC = 6 (moderate complexity) combined with these cohesion and method counts suggests the implementation could be decomposed to reduce complexity and responsibility concentration. LOC = 31 and NOF = 1 do not contradict decomposition potential (small size does not preclude multiple responsibilities). Fan-in = 0 and Fan-out = 0 indicate low coupling to other classes, making internal decomposition feasible. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
