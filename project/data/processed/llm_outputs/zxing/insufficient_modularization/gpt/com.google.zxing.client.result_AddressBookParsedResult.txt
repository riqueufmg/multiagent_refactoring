    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high size and complexity metrics (nof=16 fields, nom=19 methods, nopm=19 public methods, loc=137) and a high cyclomatic/complexity measure (wmc=22) indicating many responsibilities. The shallow inheritance (dit=1) and zero fan-in/fan-out suggest these responsibilities are contained in this single class rather than distributed, so further decomposition could reduce class size and implementation complexity."
