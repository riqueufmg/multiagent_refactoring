    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=30, NOM=3 and WMC=3 indicate low implementation size and low complexity. Low coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0) reduce need for further decomposition. Cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0) suggests good cohesion. Given these metrics, there is no evidence of a class that has not been decomposed; insufficient modularization is not detected."
