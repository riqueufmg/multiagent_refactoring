    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs that further decomposition could reduce size/complexity: LOC = 137 (large class size for a single class), WMC = 25 (high complexity concentrated in a small number of methods), NOM = 6 with NOPM = 3 (relatively few methods but high overall complexity suggests methods contain multiple responsibilities), NOF = 1 (few fields, behavior-heavy), and it depends on multiple domain elements (GenericGF, GenericGFPoly, ReedSolomonException) implying it handles distinct concerns (polynomial arithmetic and decoding logic). Although LCOM = 0.0 indicates high cohesion, the combination of high LOC and high WMC in a cohesive but complex class supports detection of Insufficient Modularization because decomposition could reduce method complexity and overall size."
