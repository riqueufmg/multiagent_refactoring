    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: large size (loc=402) and high complexity (wmc=48) combined with many methods (nom=20) and fields (nof=11). It exposes few public methods (nopm=3) which implies many internal/private behaviors that could be separated into smaller classes. The presence of inner types (Detector.Point, Detector.CorrectedParameter) together with dependencies across varied responsibilities (BitMatrix, GridSampler, GenericGF/ReedSolomonDecoder, MathUtils) indicates the class mixes detection, sampling and error-correction logic. Although lcom=0.1 suggests cohesion is not necessarily poor, the overall size and high cognitive complexity strongly justify decomposition into smaller modules/classes."
