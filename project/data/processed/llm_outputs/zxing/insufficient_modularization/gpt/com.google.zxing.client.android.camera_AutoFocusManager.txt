    "justification": "WMC=12 (relatively high complexity) with only nom=6 methods; loc=85 (moderate size) combined with nof=8 fields (substantial internal state) and nopm=1 (only one public method) — most behavior is implemented internally; presence of an inner class dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.AutoFocusManager.AutoFocusTask) indicates embedded sub-responsibility that can be separated. Together these elements show the class bundles implementation detail and complexity that could be reduced by further decomposition."
