    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.Encoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class is large and complex in isolation: LOC=434 and WMC=90 indicate high implementation complexity; NOM=25 (with only NOPM=3 public methods) shows many internal methods suggesting multiple responsibilities hidden inside one class. The class depends on a wide variety of collaborators (Mode, Version, MatrixUtil, MaskUtil, MinimalEncoder, ByteMatrix, GenericGF, CharacterSetECI, BitArray, ErrorCorrectionLevel, EncodeHintType, QRCode, StringUtils), which implies it coordinates many distinct encoding concerns (data analysis, error-correction, masking, matrix construction, character-set handling). Although LCOM=0.08 suggests reasonable cohesion, the combination of high size (LOC), high complexity (WMC), many methods, and numerous distinct dependency domains supports that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from modularization (separating responsibilities such as bit-stream generation, error-correction code generation, masking/matrix placement, and encoding strategy selection)."
