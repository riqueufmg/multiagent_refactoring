    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 244) combined with high complexity (wmc = 18) while exposing a small number of methods (nom = 4) — this suggests methods are large and the class contains multiple responsibilities that could be split. There are 6 fields (nof = 6) for only 4 methods, which often indicates concentrated state and behavior that could be distributed across smaller classes. Cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.5), not high enough to rule out decomposition. The class is also isolated in dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, only two listed dependencies), implying its internal complexity is self-contained rather than delegated. Taken together (loc, wmc, nom, nof, lcom), these elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
