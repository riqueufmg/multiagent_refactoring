    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer.MinimalEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization because it is large in size (loc = 160) while having no declared methods (nom = 0) and a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 5), indicating the class likely mixes data and implementation in a single unit. Complexity and cohesion indicators are not positive (wmc = 0, lcom = -1.0) and coupling is low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, single listed dependency = com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Reader), which means its responsibilities can likely be split without high coupling cost. Together these metrics suggest the class has not been fully decomposed and could be refactored into smaller, more focused modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
