    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: it is small (LOC=54), has few methods (nom=4, nopm=2) and a limited public API, indicating limited responsibility. Cyclomatic complexity is moderate (WMC=13) across a small method set and does not by itself imply a large undivided class. Cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) suggests reasonable cohesion, and coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) plus a short dependency list further argue against a need for decomposition. Based on these elements, no insufficient modularization detected."
