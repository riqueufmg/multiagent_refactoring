    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no internal complexity or responsibilities that suggest further decomposition: LOC=5, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, NC=0. Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion issues for a trivial/empty class. Given these metrics and analyzing the class in isolation, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
