    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=51, NOM=5, NOF=2. Complexity is low (WMC=7) and cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). There are no inheritance or dependency indicators (DIT=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and well decomposed, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
