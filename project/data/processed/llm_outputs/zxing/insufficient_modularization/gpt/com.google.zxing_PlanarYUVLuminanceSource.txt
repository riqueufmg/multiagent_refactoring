    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 103) combined with high implementation complexity (wmc = 20). It has many elements exposed/managed (nof = 6 fields, nom = 9 methods, nopm = 8 public methods) which increases its surface and responsibilities. Although depth of inheritance is shallow (dit = 1), the concentrated complexity and number of public methods suggest the class has multiple responsibilities that could be split into smaller, focused classes or helpers to reduce size and complexity."
