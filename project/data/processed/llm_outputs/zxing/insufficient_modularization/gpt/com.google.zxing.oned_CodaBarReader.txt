    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high size (LOC = 226) and high complexity (WMC = 48) concentrated in a single class. It maintains substantial internal state (NOF = 10) while exposing few public entry points (NOPM = 2) and a moderate number of methods (NOM = 8), which suggests many implementation details are bundled inside the class rather than delegated. DIT = 1 indicates little inheritance-based decomposition available. Although LCOM = 0.0 indicates the class is cohesive, the absolute size and complexity metrics (LOC and WMC) justify decomposing responsibilities to reduce implementation complexity and class size."
