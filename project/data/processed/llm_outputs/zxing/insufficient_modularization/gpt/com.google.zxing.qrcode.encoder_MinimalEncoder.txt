    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MinimalEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large (loc=382) and high implementation complexity (wmc=46) while holding many fields (nof=17) and a non-trivial number of methods (nom=13). The dependency list includes multiple inner/component types (MinimalEncoder.VersionSize, MinimalEncoder.Edge, MinimalEncoder.ResultList), indicating the class contains several embedded responsibilities or subcomponents that could be extracted. These characteristics (size, complexity, many fields, and internal components) justify recommending further decomposition into smaller, focused classes."
