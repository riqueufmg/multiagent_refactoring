    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: 10 methods (nom=10) all public (nopm=10) implemented in a small file (loc=56) with moderate complexity (wmc=10) and only moderate cohesion (lcom=0.5). It also holds 5 fields (nof=5), indicating state used across many public operations. The combination of many public operations, moderate complexity, and reduced cohesion suggests the class encapsulates multiple responsibilities that could be separated to improve cohesion and reduce complexity."
