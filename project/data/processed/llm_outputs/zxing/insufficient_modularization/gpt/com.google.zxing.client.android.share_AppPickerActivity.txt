    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=33, NOM=3, NOF=1 and WMC=5 indicate low size and moderate complexity. Although LCOM=0.666 suggests some cohesion weakness, the overall small footprint and zero fan-in/fan-out (no external usage/dependence within provided data) mean there is insufficient evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. Dependencies are limited to two classes, so decomposition is not clearly warranted in isolation."
