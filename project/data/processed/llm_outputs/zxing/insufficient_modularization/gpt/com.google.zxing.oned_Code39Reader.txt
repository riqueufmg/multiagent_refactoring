    "justification": "Detected due to high size and complexity concentrated in a single class: LOC = 254 and WMC = 52 indicate a large, complex implementation. There are relatively few methods (NOM = 8, NOPM = 4) so complexity is concentrated inside methods rather than spread across well-factored smaller units. The class holds multiple fields (NOF = 7) which combined with the above suggests multiple responsibilities/state being managed. DIT = 1 and NC = 0 show little use of inheritance to decompose behavior, and FANIN/FANOUT = 0 indicate the class is self-contained rather than delegating. LCOM = 0.25 (moderate cohesion) does not contradict the presence of multiple responsibilities when considered with the high LOC and WMC. Together these metrics justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
