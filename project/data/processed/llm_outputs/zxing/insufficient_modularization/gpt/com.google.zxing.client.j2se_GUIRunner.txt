    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: small size (LOC=68), low complexity (WMC=5), few methods (NOM=5) and fields (NOF=2), high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). No inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no coupling signals in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these values, the class is compact and cohesive, so there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
