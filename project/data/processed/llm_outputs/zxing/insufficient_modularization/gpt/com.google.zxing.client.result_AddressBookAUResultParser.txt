    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: loc=37, nom=2, nopm=1. Although WMC=7 shows some method complexity, the overall size and number of methods are low and LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no broad coupling. With DIT=1 there is minimal inheritance depth. Taken in isolation, these elements do not justify further decomposition for Insufficient Modularization."
