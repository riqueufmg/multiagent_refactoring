    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.detector.Detector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a likely candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it has high size and complexity (LOC=249, WMC=32) while containing a moderate number of methods (NOM=11) but very few public entry points (NOPM=2), implying many internal/private operations concentrated in one class. It holds little state (NOF=2) yet implements substantial behavior, and it directly depends on multiple collaborators (WhiteRectangleDetector, BitMatrix, ResultPoint, GridSampler, NotFoundException), suggesting it is orchestrating several responsibilities. These metrics (high LOC and WMC, many internal methods, multiple external dependencies) indicate the class could be decomposed into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
