    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=26, number of methods (nom)=1, non-overloaded public methods (nopm)=1, weighted methods complexity (WMC)=4. Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1) indicate limited responsibilities. These metrics show no evidence that the class is large or contains multiple decomposable responsibilities, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
