    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=35 and WMC=7 (complexity not excessive). It has a balanced set of members (nof=5, nom=7) and a low LCOM=0.2857 indicating good cohesion. There are no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) that would suggest a large, undecomposed responsibility. Based on these metrics, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
