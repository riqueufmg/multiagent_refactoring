    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small (loc=32) with a modest number of methods (nom=6, nopm=6) and low complexity (wmc=6). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), there are no public fields (nopf=0), and coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition or that the class is insufficiently modularized."
