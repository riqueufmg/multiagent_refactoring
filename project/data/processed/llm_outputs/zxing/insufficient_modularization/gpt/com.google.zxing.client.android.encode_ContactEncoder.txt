    "justification": "nom=5 and loc=50 show the class is small; wmc=11 is moderate for 5 methods (no extreme complexity); lcom=-1.0 indicates high cohesion (methods related); fanin=0 and fanout=0 show low coupling and limited external interactions; only one dependency (Formatter). These metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large, or multi-responsibility class, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
