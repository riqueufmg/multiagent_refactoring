    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: nom=3 methods, loc=48, wmc=9 (moderate complexity) and LCOM=-1.0 (indicates high cohesion). Only 1 public method (nopm=1) and no external call coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=2 is modest. Given the low method count, small size and strong cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition (insufficient modularization) is needed."
