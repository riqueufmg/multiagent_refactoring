    "justification": "Class is extremely small and contains no decomposable elements: loc=1, nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no complexity). Fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate no interactions to modularize further. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized."
