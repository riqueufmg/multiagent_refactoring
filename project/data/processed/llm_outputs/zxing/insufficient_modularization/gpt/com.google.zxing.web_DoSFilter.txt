    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.DoSFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show Insufficient Modularization. Metrics indicate a small, cohesive unit: LOC=56, number of methods=4 (nopm=3), WMC=10 (moderate complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion), fields=2, fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), and a single listed dependency (DoSTracker). These values suggest the class is compact and cohesive and unlikely to benefit from further decomposition."
