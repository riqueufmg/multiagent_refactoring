    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=21, NOM=4, WMC=4, NOF=1, NOPM=2. It has no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). Although LCOM=0.75 indicates moderate cohesion concerns, the overall size and complexity are too small to justify further decomposition; splitting is unlikely to reduce implementation complexity or size in isolation."
