    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=30, NOF=2, NOM=6, WMC=7 (moderate complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). All methods are public (NOPM=6) but overall size and complexity are low. No external coupling or inheritance complexity (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, DIT=0). Given these values, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed or would benefit from further modularization."
