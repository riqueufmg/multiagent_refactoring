    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: small size (LOC=62), few methods (NOM=4) and few fields (NOF=2) limit opportunities for further decomposition. Cyclomatic complexity is moderate (WMC=11) but not extreme for 4 methods, cohesion is acceptable (LCOM=0.5), and the class has minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these values in isolation, there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
