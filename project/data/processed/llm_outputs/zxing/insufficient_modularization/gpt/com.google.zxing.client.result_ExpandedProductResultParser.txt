    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High cyclomatic/implementation complexity concentrated in few methods: wmc = 49 while nom = 3 and nopm = 1, indicating very large/complex methods rather than many small ones. loc = 111 further shows substantial size for a single class. nof = 0 (no fields) implies the class is behavior-heavy (parsing logic concentrated in methods). dit = 1 (minimal inheritance) and the listed parser dependencies suggest this class encapsulates complex parsing responsibilities that could be decomposed. These elements together indicate insufficient modularization and a need to split functionality into smaller methods or helper classes."
