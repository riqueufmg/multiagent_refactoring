    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=27, NOM=2, WMC=4 indicate low size and complexity. It has no fields (NOF=0) and high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and only two dependencies are listed. Given the minimal number of methods and low complexity, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized or in need of further decomposition."
