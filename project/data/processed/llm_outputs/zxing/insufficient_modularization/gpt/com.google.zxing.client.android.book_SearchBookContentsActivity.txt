    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.book.SearchBookContentsActivity",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 190) and moderate-to-high complexity (WMC = 15) indicating substantial implementation inside one class; an unusually high number of fields (nof = 14) combined with a small number of methods (nom = 7, nopm = 3) suggests the class maintains a lot of state and likely multiple responsibilities rather than being decomposed into focused collaborators; presence of an inner type (SearchBookContentsActivity.NetworkTask) and dependencies on HttpHelper, LocaleManager and Intents indicate mixing of networking, locale/intent handling and UI/search concerns that are good candidates for extraction. These elements together justify that further decomposition (extracting network/HTTP handling, task logic, and possibly locale/intent utilities) would likely reduce size and complexity, so the smell is detected."
