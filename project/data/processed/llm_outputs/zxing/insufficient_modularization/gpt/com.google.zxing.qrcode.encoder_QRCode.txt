    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.QRCode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC is small (72), number of methods is moderate (nom=13), weighted method complexity is modest (wmc=14), fields are limited (nof=6) and public fields minimal (nopf=1), and cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). There is no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no reported coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These elements suggest the class is not excessively large or complex and therefore does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
