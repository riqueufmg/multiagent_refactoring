    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=11, nom=1 method, wmc=1 (low complexity). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). Fields are few (nof=3) and coupling is minimal (fanout=0, single dependency: TimeZoneInfo). Given low size, low complexity, high cohesion and low coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
