    "justification": "Class has high size and complexity for a single unit: 120 LOC, 22 methods (nom=22) and WMC=22, and 11 fields (nof=11). Cohesion is only moderate (LCOM=0.5), suggesting multiple responsibilities or loosely related members. Fan-in/fan-out and DIT provide no supporting evidence of modularization. These metrics together indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
