    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation complexity and size indicate Insufficient Modularization: WMC = 21 (high cyclomatic/implementation complexity) and LOC = 109 (large class body) while nominal method count is small (nom = 5) with few public methods (nopm = 2), which implies complex, large method bodies and concentrated responsibilities that could be decomposed. nof = 0 (no fields) and low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, only two external dependencies) suggest the class is self-contained and can be refactored into smaller modules without heavy coupling impact. These elements together justify that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
