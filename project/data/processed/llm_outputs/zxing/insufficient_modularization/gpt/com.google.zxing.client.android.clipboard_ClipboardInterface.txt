    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=31, NOM=5 (NOPM=3), NOF=1; complexity is low (WMC=6); cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.4) and does not suggest fragmented responsibilities; no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate the class has insufficient modularization or needs further decomposition."
