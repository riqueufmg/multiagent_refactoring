    "justification": "Metrics show the class is small and simple: loc=23, nof=4, nom=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods (nom=0) and no measurable complexity (wmc=0). In isolation these values do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
