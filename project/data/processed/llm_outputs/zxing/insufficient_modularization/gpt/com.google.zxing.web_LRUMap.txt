    "justification": "Class is small and well-focused: LOC=15, NOM=2, NOF=1, WMC=2 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion. FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no external dependencies) further indicate the class is self-contained. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
