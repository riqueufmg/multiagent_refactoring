    "justification": "Not detected: the class is moderate in size (loc=95) with a modest number of methods (nom=11, nopm=11) and moderate complexity (wmc=13). It has only 2 fields and low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0, limited dependencies). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). These metrics do not indicate an undivided, overly large, or incohesive class that would benefit from further decomposition."
