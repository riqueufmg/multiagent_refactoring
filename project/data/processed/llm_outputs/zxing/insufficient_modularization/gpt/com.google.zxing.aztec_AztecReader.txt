    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: low number of methods (nom = 3) and modest size (loc = 75) mean the class is small; cyclomatic complexity (wmc = 11) yields an average complexity per method (~3.7) that is moderate, not extreme; cohesion is high (lcom = -1.0) which argues against splitting responsibilities; dependencies exist but do not by themselves imply multiple responsibilities. Taken in isolation, these elements do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
