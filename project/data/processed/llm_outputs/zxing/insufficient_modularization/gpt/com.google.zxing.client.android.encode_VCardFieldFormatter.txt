    "justification": "WMC = 10 (high complexity) combined with LCOM = 0.5 (moderate/low cohesion) indicates the class encapsulates multiple, not tightly related responsibilities. NOM = 4 with NOPM = 1 (few public methods but multiple internal methods) suggests internal behavior that could be factored out. Although LOC = 46 is not large, the concentrated complexity in methods (high WMC) and moderate cohesion justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and would likely benefit from decomposition to reduce implementation complexity."
