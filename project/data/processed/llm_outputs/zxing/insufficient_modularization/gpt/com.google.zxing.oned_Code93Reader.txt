    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LCOM = 0.0 (high cohesion) and nopm = 2 (small public surface) show focused responsibility; nom = 8 and nof = 6 indicate a limited number of members; loc = 221 is moderate. While WMC = 47 shows nontrivial internal complexity, high cohesion (LCOM = 0.0) and a small API suggest the complexity is internal to a single, cohesive responsibility rather than evidence the class should be split. Dependencies are limited to barcode/format and exception types, consistent with a focused reader implementation. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
