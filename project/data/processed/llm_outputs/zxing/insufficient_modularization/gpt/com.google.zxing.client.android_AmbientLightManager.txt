    "justification": "Class does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=47), limited number of methods (nom=5) and fields (nof=5), moderate complexity (wmc=11) but not excessive, cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.4). No inheritance or broad coupling (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies. Based on these metrics in isolation, further decomposition is not clearly warranted."
