    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size and complexity: LOC=442 and WMC=89 indicate a large, complex class. Large API surface: NOM=31 with NOPM=29 (most methods are public) suggests many responsibilities and a broad interface. Low number of fields (NOF=4) yields ~7.75 methods per field, implying many operations per data element and potential for splitting behavior into smaller classes. Although LCOM=0.0645 indicates methods are related, the combination of high LOC, high WMC, and many public methods supports that the class is not sufficiently modularized and could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
