    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC is small (45), number of methods is low (nom=7) and fields are few (nof=2), overall complexity is moderate (WMC=9). Although LCOM is relatively high (0.857) suggesting some cohesion concerns, the class size and method count are small and do not warrant decomposition based on the provided data. Fan-in/fan-out are 0, and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1), so there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
