    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and complex for a single unit: LOC = 261 and WMC = 61 indicate high implementation size and complexity. It has 9 methods (nom = 9) with only 2 fields (nof = 2), suggesting a behavior-heavy class rather than a small data holder. The class depends on multiple distinct concepts (Mode, BitSource, StringUtils, Version, CharacterSetECI, FormatException, ErrorCorrectionLevel), which implies it handles several responsibilities (parsing modes, character sets, error correction, versioning). Although LCOM = 0.222 is not extremely high, the combination of high WMC, substantial LOC, multiple parsing-related dependencies, and many methods supports that the class has insufficient modularization and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, responsibility-focused classes."
