    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted: LOC=46, NOM=3 (NOPM=2), WMC=8, NOF=2, LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). Fanout=0 and only 2 dependencies (GenericGF, GenericGFPoly) show limited coupling. Given low size, low complexity and high cohesion, this does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
