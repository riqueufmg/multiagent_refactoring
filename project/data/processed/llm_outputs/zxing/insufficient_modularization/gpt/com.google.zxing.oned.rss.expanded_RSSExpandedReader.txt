    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 607) and very high complexity (wmc = 123) indicate it contains many responsibilities that could be split. It declares many fields (nof = 20) and a large number of methods (nom = 21), which together with the high WMC suggest methods are complex and the class is doing too much. The long dependency list (multiple external types referenced) also implies multiple concerns handled within the class. These elements (LOC, WMC, NOF, NOM, and the dependency count) justify decomposing the class into smaller, focused modules."
