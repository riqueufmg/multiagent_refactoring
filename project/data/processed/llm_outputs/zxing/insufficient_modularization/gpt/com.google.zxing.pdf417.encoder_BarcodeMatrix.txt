    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=43, NOM=6, NOF=4, WMC=8 and LCOM=0.0 indicate modest complexity and high cohesion. There are no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no deep inheritance (DIT=0). Given the low size, limited number of responsibilities and high cohesion, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
