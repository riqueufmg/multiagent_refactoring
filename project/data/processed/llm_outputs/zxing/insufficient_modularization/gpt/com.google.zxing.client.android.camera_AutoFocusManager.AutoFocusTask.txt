    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC = 11, WMC = 0, NOM = 0, NOPM = 0. Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and there are no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition (no insufficient modularization)."
