    "justification": "Metrics show a small, focused class: LOC=33, NOM=2, NOF=3 and WMC=5. The low number of methods and small size indicate limited responsibilities; WMC=5 is not high enough to signal excessive internal complexity. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0) and dependencies are limited to three external types. LCOM=1.0 indicates cohesion among members. Taken in isolation, these elements do not justify further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
