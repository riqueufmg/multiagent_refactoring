    "justification": "LCOM = 0.222 (high cohesion) indicates the class's methods work on shared state; LOC = 93 and NOM = 9 show only moderate size/number of methods; WMC = 20 is borderline but not by itself proof of missing decomposition; NOF = 6 is moderate and fanin = 0 / fanout = 0 indicate low coupling. Considering the class in isolation, these metrics do not support that it has insufficient modularization."
