    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: moderate size (LOC=107) and concentrated complexity (WMC=17) in a single class; low cohesion (LCOM=0.8) indicating methods are not tightly related; small state (NOF=1) but multiple methods (NOM=5, NOPM=4) — behavior is not aligned with data members; no inheritance/decomposition (DIT=0) to split responsibilities; depends on multiple external concepts (PerspectiveTransform, BitMatrix, NotFoundException), suggesting mixed responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
