    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 170) and high complexity (WMC = 36) indicate substantial implementation concentrated in one class; a moderate number of methods (nom = 8) but few public entry points (nopm = 2) suggests many internal helper behaviors that could be split out; no fields (nof = 0) implies behavior-heavy implementation rather than clear encapsulated state, further hinting at multiple responsibilities implemented as methods. Taken in isolation, these metrics justify refactoring into smaller, more focused classes/modules to reduce size and complexity."
