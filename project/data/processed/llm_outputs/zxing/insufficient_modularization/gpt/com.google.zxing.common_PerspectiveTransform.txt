    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.PerspectiveTransform",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: it is small (loc=86) with a moderate number of methods (nom=8, nopm=5) and moderate cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=11). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), indicating methods work on shared state rather than disparate responsibilities. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0), and the field count (nof=9) is reasonable for a geometric transformation object. These metrics indicate the class is cohesive, not overly large or complex, and therefore does not require further decomposition."
