    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.EncodeActivity",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation size and complexity: LOC=159 and WMC=21 (above common thresholds) indicate the class contains substantial and complex code. Moderate number of members (nof=5, nom=7) with few public methods (nopm=3) suggests internal responsibilities are concentrated rather than exposed via a small, clear interface. Cohesion is not extremely high (LCOM=0.2857), leaving room for further separation of concerns. The class also depends on multiple encoder/intent concerns (dependencies: QRCodeEncoder, Contents, Intents), which implies mixed responsibilities that could be split. Together these factors justify that the class is a candidate for decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
