    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 350), very high complexity (wmc = 102), and many methods (nom = 18) indicating concentrated functionality that could be split. It has few fields (nof = 3) while exposing many behaviors, suggesting procedural/behavioral bloat rather than well-separated responsibilities. The class also depends on numerous decoder-related types (BlockParsedResult, BitArray, DecodedChar, CurrentParsingState, DecodedInformation, FormatException, FieldParser, DecodedNumeric), which implies it handles multiple concerns. These elements together justify treating this class as a candidate for further decomposition into smaller, focused modules/classes."
