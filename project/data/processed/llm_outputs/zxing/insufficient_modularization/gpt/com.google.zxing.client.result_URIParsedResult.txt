    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=51), low method count (nom=7, nopm=5), modest complexity (WMC=9), only 2 fields (nof=2), high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These factors suggest the class is appropriately decomposed and does not require further modularization."
