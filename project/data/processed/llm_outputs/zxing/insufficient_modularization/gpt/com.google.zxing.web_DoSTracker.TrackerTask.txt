    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted methods per class (wmc) = 0 show no sizable method body to decompose; number of fields (nof) = 2 is small; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 indicate no coupling pressure that would suggest splitting responsibilities; although loc = 50 is moderate, without methods or complexity there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities that could be modularized. LCOM = -1.0 is not a positive signal of low cohesion in this data set. Therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
