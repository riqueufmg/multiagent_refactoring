    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.DefaultGridSampler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=37), very few methods (nom=2, nopm=2), moderate cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=7) and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies (PerspectiveTransform, BitMatrix, NotFoundException) are consistent with a focused responsibility. Given these elements, there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
