    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.BinaryShiftToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=30, number of methods=3, number of fields=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Complexity is not excessive (WMC=7) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1). There are only 2 dependencies and no incoming/outgoing coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is adequately modularized and does not require further decomposition."
