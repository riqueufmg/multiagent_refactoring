    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=29, number of methods=2, number of fields=2. Complexity is low (WMC=5) and lack-of-cohesion is minimal (LCOM=0.0), indicating cohesive responsibilities. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and it has a single dependency (com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix). Given its small size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further—insufficient modularization is not detected."
