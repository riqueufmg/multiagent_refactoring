    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.FinderPatternFinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=536) and high complexity (wmc=107) while containing many methods (nom=22) but a small public API (nopm=2), indicating many internal responsibilities and helper routines. It also has a non-trivial number of fields (nof=9) and several external dependencies (BitMatrix, FinderPattern, FinderPatternInfo, ResultPoint, ResultPointCallback, DecodeHintType, NotFoundException), suggesting the class coordinates multiple concerns. These metrics together indicate the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
