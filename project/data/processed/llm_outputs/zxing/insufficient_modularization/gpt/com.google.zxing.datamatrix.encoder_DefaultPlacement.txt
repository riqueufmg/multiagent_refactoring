    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LOC=153, WMC=26, NOM=14 and NOPM=3 show the class has substantial size and internal complexity with many non-public methods. NOF=4 with FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 indicates the complexity is concentrated inside this single, self-contained class. These metrics together suggest the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
