    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.BitMatrixParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and complex in isolation: LOC=372 and WMC=71 indicate high implementation size and cyclomatic complexity. It declares NOM=11 methods, suggesting substantial internal behavior concentrated in one class. Although LCOM=0.0 indicates cohesion, the absolute size (LOC) and complexity (WMC) are high enough that further decomposition could meaningfully reduce size and implementation complexity. The small set of external dependencies (Version, BitMatrix, FormatException) implies much functionality is implemented inside this single class rather than delegated, supporting the detection of Insufficient Modularization."
