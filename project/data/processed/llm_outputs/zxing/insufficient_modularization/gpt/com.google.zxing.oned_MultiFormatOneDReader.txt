    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.MultiFormatOneDReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High weighted method count (wmc = 15) concentrated in a small number of methods (nom = 3) indicates large/complex methods that likely bundle multiple responsibilities; moderate size (loc = 65) further supports substantive implementation inside the class; only two fields (nof = 2) so complexity arises from behavior rather than state, suggesting methods could be split into cooperating classes/objects; dependencies on multiple distinct concepts (BarcodeFormat, BitArray, OneDReader, DecodeHintType, NotFoundException) imply the class handles varied responsibilities. Although LCOM = 0.0 suggests methods relate to shared state, the combination of high WMC with few methods and external dependencies justifies that the class is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from decomposition."
