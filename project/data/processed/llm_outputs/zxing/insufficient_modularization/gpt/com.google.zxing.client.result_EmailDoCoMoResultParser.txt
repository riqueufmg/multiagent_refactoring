    "justification": "Class is small and focused: LOC=33, NOF=3, NOM=2, NOPM=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) indicating a single responsibility. Complexity is modest (WMC=6) and inheritance depth is low (DIT=2). Coupling metrics show no incoming/outgoing dependency pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate an incomplete decomposition or a need for further modularization."
