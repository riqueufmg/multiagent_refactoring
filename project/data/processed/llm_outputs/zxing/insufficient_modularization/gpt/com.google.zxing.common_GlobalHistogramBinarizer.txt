    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.GlobalHistogramBinarizer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 139) and high complexity (WMC = 29) indicate it contains substantial logic that could be split. It also has 6 fields and 6 methods (4 non-private/public methods), suggesting multiple responsibilities exposed by the class. Cohesion is only moderate (LCOM = 0.333), and it depends on several distinct types (LuminanceSource, BitMatrix, BitArray, NotFoundException), implying mixed concerns (data handling and algorithmic processing) that could be separated to reduce size and complexity."
