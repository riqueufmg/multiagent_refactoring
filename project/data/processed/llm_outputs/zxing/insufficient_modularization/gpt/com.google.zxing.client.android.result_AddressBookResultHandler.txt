    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation complexity and size: WMC = 26 and LOC = 126 indicate a complex, sizeable class; API surface and responsibility spread: NOM = 8 with NOPM = 6 (many public methods) suggests multiple responsibilities; cohesion is moderate: LCOM = 0.375 (not highly cohesive) implying methods could belong to separate concerns; no inheritance decomposition available: DIT = 1 and NC = 0. These metrics together justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
