    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=11, WMC=0, NOM=0. Although it has 9 fields (NOF=9), there are no methods (NOM=0) and cohesion indicator LCOM=-1.0 suggests it is a simple data holder rather than an undecomposed large class. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is zero (DIT=0). These metrics do not support a diagnosis of insufficient modularization."
