    "justification": "Class has only one method (nom=1, nopm=1) but that method is large and complex (loc=57, wmc=10). A single high-WMC method indicates multiple responsibilities and branching that would be better decomposed into smaller helper methods. The low number of methods/fields (nof=1) combined with high method complexity justifies Insufficient Modularization: the class is not decomposed into finer-grained methods/units and should be refactored to reduce size and implementation complexity."
