    "justification": "WMC = 15 (high complexity for a small class) combined with NOM = 5 and only 1 public method (NOPM = 1) indicates complexity concentrated inside a few methods; LOC = 59 shows moderate size that could be decomposed; LCOM = 0.4 (only moderate cohesion) suggests multiple responsibilities. These elements together justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and could benefit from decomposition to reduce complexity."
