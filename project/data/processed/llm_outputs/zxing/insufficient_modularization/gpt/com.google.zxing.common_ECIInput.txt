    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=44, NOM=6, WMC=6 (low complexity). LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. No incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. Given limited size, low complexity, and good cohesion, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
