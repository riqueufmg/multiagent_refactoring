    "justification": "Class has low size and complexity: loc=25, nom=2 (nopm=1), wmc=4. It has no fields (nof=0) and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). No external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the small number of methods, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
