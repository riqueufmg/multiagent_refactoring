    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High lack of cohesion and moderate complexity indicate insufficient modularization: LCOM=0.833 (methods are weakly related), WMC=9 with NOM=6 (several methods and nontrivial complexity for a small class), only 1 field (methods do not share state and can likely be split into separate responsibilities). LOC=42 is small but does not outweigh the cohesion and complexity signals; DIT=1 and zero fanin/fanout do not mitigate the internal low cohesion. These factors together justify that the class should be decomposed to improve modularity."
