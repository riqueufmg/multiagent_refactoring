    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.ResultParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high implementation size (LOC = 184) and high cyclomatic/weight complexity (WMC = 43) while containing many behaviors (nom = 16). It also has a moderate cohesion score (LCOM = 0.5625) rather than strong cohesion, indicating multiple responsibilities. There are multiple fields (nof = 6) and relatively few public API methods (nopm = 2, nopf = 0), suggesting much internal logic is implemented as private helpers rather than separated into smaller classes. Taken together (LOC, WMC, method count, moderate cohesion, and internal-heavy implementation), these elements justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
