    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=25, WMC=5, NOM=5, NOF=3. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. No nested types (NC=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and there is only a single external dependency (com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix). Given the low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence in isolation that the class requires further decomposition."
