    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=41, NOM=6, NOF=4. Complexity is low/moderate (WMC=8). High cohesion indicated by LCOM=0.0. Limited public surface (NOPM=4, NOPF=2) and no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate a large, monolithic class that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
