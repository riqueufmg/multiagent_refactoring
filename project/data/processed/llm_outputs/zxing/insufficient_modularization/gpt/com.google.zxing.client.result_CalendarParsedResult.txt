    "justification": "High method and field counts and overall complexity indicate insufficient decomposition: number of fields nof=14, number of methods nom=19 (public methods nopm=15), LOC=173, WMC=28. These values show a large class surface and implementation complexity that could be reduced by further modularization. (LCOM=0.0 shows cohesion is good, but does not negate the class size/complexity evidence.)"
