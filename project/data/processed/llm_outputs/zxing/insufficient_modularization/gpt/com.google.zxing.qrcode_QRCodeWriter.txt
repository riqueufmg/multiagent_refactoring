    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class: small size (loc=67), small number of methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and only one field (nof=1) imply limited internal surface to decompose. Although cyclomatic burden is non‑zero (wmc=13), the complexity is concentrated across only three methods (average complexity ~4.3) rather than many responsibilities spread through the class. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0) indicating methods work on common data, and depth of inheritance is zero (dit=0) so there is no missed opportunity to split behavior across a hierarchy. External dependencies exist but do not by themselves imply insufficient modularization. Based on these elements taken in isolation, the class does not exhibit the Insufficient Modularization smell."
