    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=17), low complexity (wmc=3), few methods (nom=3), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class is concise and focused with only two fields and limited dependencies, so there is no evidence it should be further decomposed."
