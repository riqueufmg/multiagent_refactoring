    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate clear insufficient modularization: LOC is small (70), number of methods is low (nom=4, nopm=2), and cyclomatic/weight complexity is moderate (wmc=8). There is only one field (nof=1) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency). Cohesion (lcom=0.5) is only mildly concerning but not strong enough, in isolation, to justify further decomposition. Overall the class size and complexity are insufficient to conclude it has not been properly modularized."
