    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high size and complexity (LOC = 279, WMC = 40) indicating a large implementation body; a moderate number of methods (NOM = 13) with very few public entry points (NOPM = 2) implying many internal implementation responsibilities that could be split out; a substantial number of fields (NOF = 10) increasing internal state to manage; and many diverse dependencies (11 listed types) suggesting the class handles multiple concerns (checksum, extension support, manufacturer lookup, result/metadata handling, callbacks, decoding hints, exception handling, etc.). Despite a low LCOM value, the combination of high LOC/WMC, many fields, few public methods, and varied dependencies supports refactoring into smaller, focused classes/modules."
