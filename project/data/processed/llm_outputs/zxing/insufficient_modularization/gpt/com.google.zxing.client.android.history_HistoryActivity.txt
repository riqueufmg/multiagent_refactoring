    "justification": "LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion) indicates the class's methods work on a common responsibility, reducing need for further decomposition. Size and complexity are moderate: LOC=104, NOM=9 and WMC=17 — not extremely large or unmanageably complex in isolation. There are only 4 fields (nof=4), no nested classes (nc=0), and limited external coupling (dependencies: HistoryManager, HistoryItemAdapter, Intents; fanin=0/fanout=0), so responsibilities appear localized. These metrics collectively argue against insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
