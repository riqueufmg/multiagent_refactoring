    "justification": "LCOM = 0.6666666666666666 (low cohesion) indicates the three methods are not strongly related; NOM = 3 with NOF = 2 and LOC = 33 shows non-trivial functionality concentrated in a small class; WMC = 6 (moderate complexity) suggests the class contains several independent responsibilities; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show the class is isolated and can be refactored internally without widespread coupling. Together these metrics point to insufficient modularization: the class should be decomposed to increase cohesion and reduce per-class complexity."
