    "justification": "The class defines a large number of fields (nof=24) with all fields reported as public (nopf=24) while exposing only one method (nom=1) and very low implementation size (loc=35, wmc=1). This concentration of many data members in a single class with minimal behavior indicates the class has not been decomposed into smaller, responsibility-focused units. Additional supporting metrics: dit=0 and fanin/fanout=0 (no inheritance or interactions to justify monolith), and lcom=0.0 is not meaningful given there is only one method. These facts justify flagging Insufficient Modularization and recommend splitting responsibilities/data into separate classes or modules."
