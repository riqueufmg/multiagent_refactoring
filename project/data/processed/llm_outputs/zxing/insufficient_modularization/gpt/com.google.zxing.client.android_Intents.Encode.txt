    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: loc=27, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0, fanout=0. The class likely holds a small number of fields (nof=5) and contains no behavior to further decompose. Given the low size and complexity and the class-isolation constraint, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
