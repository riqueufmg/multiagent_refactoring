    "justification": "Metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization. The class is moderate in size (LOC=107) with a moderate number of methods (nom=9) and only 4 fields (nof=4). While cyclomatic/weight complexity is non-trivial (WMC=16), cohesion is good (LCOM=0.333), inheritance depth is zero (DIT=0) and there are no incoming/outgoing coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). Overall the class shows reasonable cohesion and only moderate complexity/size, so there is no clear need to further decompose it in isolation."
