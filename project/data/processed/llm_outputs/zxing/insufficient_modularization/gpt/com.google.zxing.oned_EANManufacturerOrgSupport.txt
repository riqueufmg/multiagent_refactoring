    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: low number of methods (nom = 3) and fields (nof = 2) imply small class surface; moderate size (loc = 140) with low complexity (wmc = 7) and very high cohesion (lcom = 0.0) show responsibilities are focused; no inheritance complexity (dit = 0) and no coupling indications (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These elements suggest the class is adequately modular and does not need further decomposition."
