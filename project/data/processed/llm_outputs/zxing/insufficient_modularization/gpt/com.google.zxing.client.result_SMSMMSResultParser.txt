    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.SMSMMSResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=59), very few methods (NOM=2, NOPM=1), low-to-moderate complexity (WMC=8), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only two dependencies. These elements indicate the class is already small, cohesive, and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not warranted."
