    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.FinderPattern",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=32, NOM=6, WMC=7 (moderate complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). It has a small number of fields (NOF=3) with no public fields (NOPF=0), low coupling (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) and a single dependency. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence the class is too large or insufficiently decomposed to warrant further modularization."
