    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization. LOC=115 and WMC=15 show moderate size/complexity but are not extreme; NOM=11 and NOF=12 are reasonable for a single cohesive class. LCOM=0.1818 indicates good cohesion (methods likely operate on common state), so the class does not appear to contain multiple unrelated responsibilities that would benefit from decomposition. FANIN/FANOUT=0 indicates low coupling that would not force splitting. Dependencies are limited to an inner ECBlocks and FormatException. Overall, cohesion and moderate complexity argue against further decomposition."
