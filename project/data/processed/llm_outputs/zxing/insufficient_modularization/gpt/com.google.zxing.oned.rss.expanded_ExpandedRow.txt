    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=36, NOF=2, NOM=7 (NOPM=3) and WMC=8 indicate limited size and moderate complexity. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). It has no external coupling in the given data (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not suggest further decomposition is needed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
