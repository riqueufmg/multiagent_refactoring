    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.ContactInfoGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 221), high complexity (WMC = 46), many methods (NOM = 20) and many fields (NOF = 11). Only 6 public methods (NOPM = 6) implies 14 non-public methods, indicating numerous internal responsibilities and helper logic that could be extracted. Although LCOM = 0.1 indicates cohesion, the combination of high LOC and WMC with many internal methods suggests the class bundles multiple concerns and would benefit from further decomposition."
