    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: LOC=20, number of methods=1 (nom=1, nopm=1), WMC=3. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only two dependencies, and LCOM=-1.0 shows no evidence of low cohesion. Given its small size, low complexity, and low coupling, there is no indication that further decomposition is required."
