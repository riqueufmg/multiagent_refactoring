    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: loc=48, nom=4, nof=2. Complexity is moderate (wmc=8) but not high enough to warrant splitting. LCOM=0.75 indicates good cohesion among members. Low coupling/dependency (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency) and few public methods (nopm=2) imply the class is already well-scoped. These metrics do not support insufficient modularization."
