    "justification": "Class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: extremely small and non-complex (LOC=1, WMC=0), no methods or fields (NOM=0, NOF=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
