    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. Evidence: small size (loc = 52) and few methods (nom = 3, nopm = 2) indicate limited scope; high cohesion (lcom = -1.0) suggests responsibilities are related; low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and a shallow inheritance depth (dit = 1) do not indicate a large, entangled module. While WMC = 12 shows moderate internal complexity, given the small number of methods and overall class size this likely reflects a few complex methods rather than an undecomposed, monolithic class—insufficient to justify decomposition in isolation."
