    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.DecodeServlet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it has very large size (loc = 349) and high implementation complexity (wmc = 41), indicating heavy internal logic. It declares 9 fields (nof = 9) and 8 methods (nom = 8) but only 2 public methods (nopm = 2), implying substantial private/internal behavior that could be split into smaller classes. Its dependency list spans multiple concerns (com.google.zxing.client.j2se.ImageReader for image I/O, com.google.zxing.multi.MultipleBarcodeReader/Reader/Result/DecodeHintType/BinaryBitmap/LuminanceSource for decoding, and com.google.zxing.web.DoSTracker for request tracking), which suggests the servlet mixes responsibilities (HTTP handling, image reading, decoding orchestration, DoS tracking). Although LCOM = 0.0 suggests internal cohesion, the combination of large LOC, high WMC, multiple distinct dependencies and limited public interface supports refactoring into smaller, focused modules to reduce size and complexity."
