    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High overall size and complexity concentrated in a small number of methods: LOC=219 and WMC=41 indicate substantial implementation complexity; NOM=6 (NOPM=3) shows complexity is concentrated into few methods (likely long/complex routines) rather than broken into smaller units. Although LCOM=0.0 indicates good cohesion, the combination of high LOC and high WMC with few methods suggests the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and could benefit from extracting smaller helper/private classes or methods to reduce size and complexity. Dependencies are limited, so the complexity appears internal to this class rather than distributed."
