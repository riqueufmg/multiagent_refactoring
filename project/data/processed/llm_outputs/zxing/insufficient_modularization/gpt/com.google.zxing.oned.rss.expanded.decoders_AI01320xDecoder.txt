    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=22, nom=3, wmc=5. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Low coupling: fanin=0, fanout=0 and a single external dependency (com.google.zxing.common.BitArray). Although DIT=4 indicates inheritance depth, the class size and complexity do not suggest it has not been decomposed; no metric indicates excessive size or implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
