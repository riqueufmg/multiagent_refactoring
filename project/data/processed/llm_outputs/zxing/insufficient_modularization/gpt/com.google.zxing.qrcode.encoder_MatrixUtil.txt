    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MatrixUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modularized: it has 20 methods (nom = 20) and 226 lines of code (loc = 226) which indicate a large implementation surface, and a high weighted method count (wmc = 55) indicating substantial internal complexity. It also declares 7 fields (nof = 7) and depends on several distinct types (QRCode, Version, BitArray, MaskUtil, ByteMatrix, ErrorCorrectionLevel), suggesting multiple responsibilities handled in one class. Although LCOM is low (0.1), the combination of high method count, high WMC and large LOC supports that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
