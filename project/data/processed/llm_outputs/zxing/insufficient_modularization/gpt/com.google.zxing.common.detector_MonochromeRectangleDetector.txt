    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.detector.MonochromeRectangleDetector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: it has high implementation size (LOC = 147) and high complexity concentrated in few methods (WMC = 21 with nom = 4 and nopm = 2). Few public entry points combined with large internal implementation suggests multiple responsibilities or large internal algorithms that could be split. Although LCOM = 0.0 indicates cohesion, the combination of large LOC and high WMC in a small set of methods warrants decomposition to reduce method size and complexity. Relevant metrics: LOC=147, WMC=21, NOM=4, NOPM=2, NOF=2; dependencies include BitMatrix, NotFoundException, ResultPoint, which signals nontrivial functionality concentrated in this class."
