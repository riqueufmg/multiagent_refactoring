    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC = 39 (small), NOM = 10 with WMC = 10 (moderate complexity but acceptable for the method count), NOF = 2 (few fields), LCOM = 0.0 (high cohesion). Additionally it has no external fan-in/fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and only a single dependency to its nested State type. These elements suggest the class is cohesive, compact, and not a clear candidate for further decomposition."
