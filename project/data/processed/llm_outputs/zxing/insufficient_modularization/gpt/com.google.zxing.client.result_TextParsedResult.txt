    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=22, NOM=4, WMC=4 indicate low size and complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion among methods. It has only NOF=2 fields, no external interactions (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single listed dependency (ParsedResultType). DIT=1 (shallow inheritance). These elements do not suggest the class has remaining responsibility that requires further decomposition."
