    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=284) and very high complexity (wmc=61) indicate methods and logic that could be split; moderate number of fields (nof=10) suggests multiple responsibilities/state held; number of methods (nom=11) combined with only 1 private method (nopm=1) implies much behavior is exposed or concentrated rather than decomposed into smaller helpers/classes; shallow inheritance (dit=1) means functionality is packed into this class rather than delegated. These elements together justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
