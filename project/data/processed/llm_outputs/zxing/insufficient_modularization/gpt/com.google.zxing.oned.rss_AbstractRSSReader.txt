    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc=104) with many members (nof=10 fields, nom=12 methods), concentrated complexity (wmc=22) and only moderate cohesion (lcom=0.5). These metrics together indicate the class likely holds multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
