    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraConfigurationManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high complexity (WMC = 30), substantial size (LOC = 156), and many methods (NOM = 12) and fields (NOF = 8), which indicate multiple responsibilities and non-trivial implementation. While cohesion is not extremely low (LCOM = 0.166), it does not offset the high complexity and size. The class also depends on multiple camera-related components (PreferencesActivity, CameraFacing, OpenCamera, FrontLightMode, CameraConfigurationUtils), suggesting it handles configuration, preferences, camera-facing logic, and front-light control — responsibilities that could be separated. These elements together justify that the class would benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
