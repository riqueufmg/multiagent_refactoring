    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=19, WMC=3, NOM=2, NOF=2 and only 1 public method (NOPM=1). Low size and low complexity metrics show no undue implementation complexity to justify further decomposition. Cohesion metric LCOM=1.0 does not indicate fragmented responsibilities, and there are no incoming/outgoing coupling concerns (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these elements, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
