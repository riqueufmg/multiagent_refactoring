    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder.Decoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 319) and high complexity (WMC = 61) concentrated in a single class with a moderate number of methods (NOM = 11) and many fields (NOF = 10). The class has only a small number of public methods (NOPM = 2) while defining inner types (Decoder.Table, Decoder.CorrectedBitsResult), indicating internal subdivisions that did not fully decompose responsibilities. Dependency set shows multiple distinct responsibilities bundled in one class (bit/Matrix handling: com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix; decoding results: AztecDetectorResult, DecoderResult; error correction and finite field logic: ReedSolomonDecoder, GenericGF; character set handling: CharacterSetECI; exception handling: FormatException), which suggests the class mixes parsing, bit-manipulation, error-correction and result construction. Considering these metrics and dependencies in isolation, the class should be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
