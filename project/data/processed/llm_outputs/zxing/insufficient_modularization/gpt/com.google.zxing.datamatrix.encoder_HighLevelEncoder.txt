    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.HighLevelEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected: the class shows signs of insufficient modularization. Key indicators: LOC=371 and WMC=73 (large size and high complexity), NOM=21 methods with NOPM=4 public methods (many internal/private methods -> concentrated internal functionality), and low LCOM=0.1428571428571428 (methods share state but does not mitigate overall size/complexity). The dependency list (EncoderContext, C40Encoder, Encoder, SymbolShapeHint) indicates the class coordinates multiple encoder-related responsibilities. Together these metrics suggest the class is doing too much and would benefit from further decomposition."
