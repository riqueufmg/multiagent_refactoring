    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=35, NOM=3, NOF=2, WMC=4 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low complexity and high cohesion. Low size and complexity suggest no further decomposition is needed. Dependency and coupling indicators are minimal (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, DIT=0), supporting that the class can be considered properly modular in isolation."
