    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.GenericMultipleBarcodeReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs it should be further decomposed: high cyclomatic complexity (wmc = 24) and moderate size (loc = 103) concentrated into a small set of methods (nom = 5, nopm = 3) — this suggests individual methods are complex and could be split. It has several fields (nof = 4) and directly depends on multiple external types (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.Reader, com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException), indicating it coordinates multiple responsibilities. Depth of inheritance is shallow (dit = 1) so behavior is not distributed via subclasses. Although cohesion metric (lcom = 0.0) is low (indicating cohesive access), the combination of high WMC and LOC implies internal complexity that can be reduced by modularizing responsibilities into smaller classes or helper components."
