    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=24, number of methods (nom)=1, no fields (nof=0). Complexity is low (WMC=4) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1). Coupling is low (fanout=0, fanin=0) and LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion. These metrics do not show a large, complex class that needs further decomposition."
