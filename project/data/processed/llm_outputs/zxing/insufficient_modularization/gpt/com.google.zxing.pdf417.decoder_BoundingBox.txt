    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs that it may contain multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed: relatively large size (LOC = 117), high implementation complexity (WMC = 23), a non-trivial number of methods (NOM = 12) and fields (NOF = 9). These values indicate concentrated logic and state that could be split to reduce size and complexity. (Note: LCOM = 0.0 indicates methods are cohesive, but cohesion alone does not negate the high complexity and size metrics suggesting insufficient modularization.)"
