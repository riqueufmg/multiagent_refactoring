    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size and complexity: LOC = 190 and WMC = 45 indicate a large, complex class. Few methods but high internal complexity: NOM = 9 with NOPM = 1 suggests much functionality is implemented inside a small set of (likely large/complex) methods. Multiple domain interactions: dependencies include BoundingBox, Codeword, BarcodeValue, BarcodeMetadata, PDF417Common, and ResultPoint, implying the class handles several responsibilities and coordinates many concepts that could be separated. Low inheritance depth (DIT = 1) and zero fan-in/fan-out in the metrics point to behavior concentrated in this class rather than delegated. These elements together support that the class is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from further decomposition."
