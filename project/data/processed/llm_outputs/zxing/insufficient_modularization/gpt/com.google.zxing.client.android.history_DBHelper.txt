    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization. The class is small (loc=24) with low complexity (wmc=3) and few methods (nom=3, nopm=2). Fan-in and fan-out are zero, showing no wide coupling. Although LCOM is 0.666 (moderate cohesion) and there are 9 fields, the overall size and complexity are low, so there is insufficient evidence in isolation to justify further decomposition."
