    "justification": "Class is small and not a clear candidate for further decomposition: LOC=32, NOM=5, NOPM=5 indicate few methods and limited size. Although LCOM=0.8 suggests lower cohesion, WMC=9 is only moderate and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the limited size and low coupling, further modularization is unlikely to meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
