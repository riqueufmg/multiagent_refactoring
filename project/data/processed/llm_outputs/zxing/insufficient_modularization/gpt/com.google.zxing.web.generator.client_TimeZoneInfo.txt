    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: loc=24, nof=4 fields, nom=5 methods, WMC=5 (low complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). Also no inheritance or coupling: DIT=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. These values do not show a class that has not been decomposed; there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would justify further modularization."
