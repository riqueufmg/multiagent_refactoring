    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Indicators show insufficient modularization: WMC = 25 (high implementation complexity concentrated in the class) combined with LOC = 112 (non-trivial size) and NOM = 6 (few methods meaning complexity is concentrated in individual methods). The class also depends on multiple external types (ResultMetadataType, Result, BitArray, BarcodeFormat, NotFoundException, UPCEANReader), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities (bit-level decoding and result/metadata handling). Although LCOM = 0.0 indicates good cohesion, the high WMC and concentrated complexity are strong signs that the class could be further decomposed (for example separating decoding logic from parsing/formatting) to reduce size and complexity."
