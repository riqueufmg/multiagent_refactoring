    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector.MultiFinderPatternFinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high size (loc = 163) and high complexity (wmc = 30) concentrated in a small number of methods (nom = 3, nopm = 2) — WMC per method is very large (~10), indicating complex, monolithic methods. Cohesion is moderate/low (lcom = 0.6667), suggesting related responsibilities are not well separated. The class also references multiple external types (7 dependencies), implying it handles several concerns. These metrics together indicate the class would benefit from further decomposition."
