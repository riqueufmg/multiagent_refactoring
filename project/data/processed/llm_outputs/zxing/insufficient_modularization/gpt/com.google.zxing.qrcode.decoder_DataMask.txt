    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.DataMask",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: LOC=84 and NOM=10 indicate limited size and a modest number of methods. Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is moderate (WMC=13) and does not by itself imply a need to split the class. There are no instance fields (NOF=0), suggesting stateless or utility-like behavior rather than an accumulation of responsibilities. Reported cohesion (LCOM=-1.0) does not indicate low cohesion that would motivate decomposition. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix). Taken in isolation, these elements do not justify marking the class as insufficiently modularized."
