    "justification": "Class is small and does not show signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=32, methods=6 (public=5), fields=1, WMC=10 (moderate complexity but within a small class), LCOM=0.5 (reasonable cohesion), fanin=0, fanout=0 and only one dependency (com.google.zxing.client.result.ParsedResultType). These metrics indicate low size, low coupling and acceptable cohesion, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided data."
