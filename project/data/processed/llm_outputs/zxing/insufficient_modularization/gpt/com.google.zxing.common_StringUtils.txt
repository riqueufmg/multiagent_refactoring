    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=198) and high implementation complexity (wmc=36) while containing few methods (nom=3, nopm=2) but many fields (nof=7, nopf=4). Cohesion is low (lcom=0.6667), suggesting methods are not tightly related. The combination of high LOC/WMC, low cohesion, many fields and few methods indicates the class likely bundles multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
