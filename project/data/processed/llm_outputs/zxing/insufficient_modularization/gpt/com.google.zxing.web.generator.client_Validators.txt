    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC=33 (small), NOM=6 (moderate number of methods), WMC=10 (moderate complexity but not excessive), LCOM=-1.0 (suggests cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no widespread coupling). Only one dependency (GeneratorException). Given the small size, modest method count, and apparent cohesion, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
