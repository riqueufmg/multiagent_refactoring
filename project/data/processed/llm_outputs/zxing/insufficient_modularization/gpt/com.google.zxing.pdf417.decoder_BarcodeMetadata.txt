    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.BarcodeMetadata",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (loc=32), modest complexity (wmc=6), small number of methods (nom=6) and fields (nof=5), very high cohesion (lcom=0.0), and no external coupling in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is compact, cohesive, and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not indicated."
