    "justification": "LCOM = 0.142857 (high cohesion) and modest size (LOC = 121, NOM = 14, NOF = 5) indicate the class's responsibilities are closely related. Although WMC = 28 shows non-trivial complexity, it alone does not imply the class is insufficiently modular given the low LCOM and shallow hierarchy (DIT = 1). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, suggesting low coupling. Overall metrics do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
