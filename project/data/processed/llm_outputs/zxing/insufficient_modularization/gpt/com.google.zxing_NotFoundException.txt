    "class": "com.google.zxing.NotFoundException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of Insufficient Modularization: very small size and complexity (loc=15, nom=2, wmc=2), only one field (nof=1) and one public method (nopm=1), no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (dit=1). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal; although LCOM=1.0 could hint at cohesion issues, given the overall tiny size and lack of dependencies this is not evidence that the class needs further decomposition in isolation."
