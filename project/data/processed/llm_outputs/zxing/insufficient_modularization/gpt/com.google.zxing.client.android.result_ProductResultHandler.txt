    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.ProductResultHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: relatively high cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc = 11) concentrated into a small implementation (loc = 39) with a moderate number of methods (nom = 6, nopm = 5). Lack of cohesion is high (lcom = 0.6667), indicating methods are not well related and the class likely carries multiple responsibilities. There is only one field (nof = 1) and shallow inheritance (dit = 1), so complexity is internal to this class rather than inherited. These metrics together justify that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
