    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Multiple metrics indicate insufficient modularization: very large size (LOC=479) and very high cyclomatic complexity (WMC=115) concentrated in a small number of methods (NOM=8) — average complexity per method ≈14.4 — which suggests large, monolithic methods. A high number of fields (NOF=30) implies the class is managing many responsibilities or state. Although LCOM=0.25 does not show extreme lack of cohesion, the combination of large LOC, very high WMC, many fields, and few methods supports that the class should be further decomposed into smaller classes/modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
