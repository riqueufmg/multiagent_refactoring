    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.Detector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is large (loc=238) and complex (wmc=37) while containing many methods (nom=14) but only a few public entry points (nopm=3), which suggests many internal helper responsibilities. It also depends on a wide set of collaborators (14 distinct dependencies) indicating multiple responsibilities are being handled inside this single class. Although LCOM=0.0 suggests internal cohesion, the combination of high size, high complexity, many methods, and many external dependencies supports that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
