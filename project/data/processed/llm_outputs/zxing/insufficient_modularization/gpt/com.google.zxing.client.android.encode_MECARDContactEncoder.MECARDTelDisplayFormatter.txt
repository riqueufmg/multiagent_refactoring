    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=6, no methods (nom=0), single field (nof=1), WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0, DIT=1, fanin=0, fanout=0, and no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further or would benefit from additional modularization."
