    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large implementation size (loc = 225) combined with high complexity (wmc = 30) indicates substantial, concentrated logic that could be split. It has a moderate number of fields (nof = 11) and a small set of methods (nom = 8, nopm = 1), suggesting complex behaviour is concentrated inside few methods rather than distributed across smaller collaborating classes. The class depends on multiple external types (7 listed dependencies), indicating it coordinates several concerns. Although lcom = 0.0 suggests cohesion, the absolute size and complexity metrics (loc and wmc) justify further decomposition to reduce method size/complexity and improve maintainability."
