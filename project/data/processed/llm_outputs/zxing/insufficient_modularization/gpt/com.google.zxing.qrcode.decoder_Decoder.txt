    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Decoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs that it bundles multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed: moderate size (LOC=114) with non-trivial complexity (WMC=13), a small set of methods (nom=7) but several public entry points (nopm=5) suggesting multiple externally visible behaviors, and a large number of distinct external dependencies (10 dependencies: com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.DataBlock, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Version, com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.GenericGF, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.BitMatrixParser, com.google.zxing.common.DecoderResult, com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.ReedSolomonDecoder, com.google.zxing.ChecksumException, com.google.zxing.FormatException, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.ErrorCorrectionLevel) indicating multiple responsibilities (parsing, error correction, decoding). Cohesion (LCOM=0.2857) is not high enough to rule out multiple concerns. Together these metrics justify that the class likely suffers from Insufficient Modularization and could benefit from splitting responsibilities (e.g., separating parsing, error-correction, and high-level decode orchestration)."
