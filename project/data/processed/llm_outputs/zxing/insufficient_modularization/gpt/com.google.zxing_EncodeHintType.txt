    "class": "com.google.zxing.EncodeHintType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No evidence of insufficient modularization: the class has modest size (loc=64) and shows no internal elements or complexity (nom=0, nof=0, nopf=0, wmc=0). Coupling metrics are empty (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. Based on these metrics in isolation, the class does not exhibit the large size or high implementation complexity that would indicate a need for further decomposition."
