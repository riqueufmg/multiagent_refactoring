    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate insufficient modularization: the class has 4 methods (nom=4) but a high cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc=14) and 77 lines of code (loc=77), suggesting large/complex methods. LCOM=0.75 shows low cohesion among methods, and there is only 1 field (nof=1), implying methods do not share much state and likely implement multiple responsibilities. Given these signs (high WMC relative to few methods, low cohesion, moderate LOC), the class should be further decomposed."
