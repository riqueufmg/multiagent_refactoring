    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization. Evidence: LOC = 344 (large class size), WMC = 71 (high implementation complexity), NOM = 21 with NOPM = 14 (many methods, many public methods indicating multiple responsibilities), NOF = 9 (several fields). These absolute measures (size, method count, and complexity) indicate the class has substantial implementation that could be further decomposed. Note: LCOM = 0.238 suggests reasonable cohesion, but the large LOC and high WMC/NOM still justify decomposition into smaller classes or helper components."
