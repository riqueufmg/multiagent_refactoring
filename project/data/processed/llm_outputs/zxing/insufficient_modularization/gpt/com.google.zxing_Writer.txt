    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=26, NOM=2, WMC=2. Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Depth of inheritance is 0 and there are only two dependencies (BarcodeFormat, WriterException). These metrics show no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
