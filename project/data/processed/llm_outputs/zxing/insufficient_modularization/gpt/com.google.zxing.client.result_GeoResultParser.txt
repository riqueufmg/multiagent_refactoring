    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.GeoResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular. Metrics indicate it is small and cohesive: only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), 41 lines of code (loc=41), and a low lack-of-cohesion score (lcom=0.0). Cyclomatic/weight metric is moderate (wmc=6) but with a single method this does not imply multiple responsibilities needing decomposition. Fanin and fanout are 0, and there are only two external dependencies. These elements together indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no evidence requiring further decomposition."
