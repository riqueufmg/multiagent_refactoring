    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.ViewfinderView",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high number of fields (nof = 15) and a non-trivial size (loc = 121) while providing only 6 methods (nom = 6), producing a relatively high cyclomatic complexity (wmc = 15). The field-to-method ratio and overall complexity suggest the class holds multiple responsibilities or sizable internal state that could be split into smaller, focused classes. Dependencies on multiple collaborators (com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraManager) further indicate mixed responsibilities that may be separated. Although LCOM = 0.0 suggests cohesion, the combination of many fields, method complexity and size justifies considering decomposition."
