    "justification": "Class analyzed in isolation shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=8), no methods reported (nom=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition."
