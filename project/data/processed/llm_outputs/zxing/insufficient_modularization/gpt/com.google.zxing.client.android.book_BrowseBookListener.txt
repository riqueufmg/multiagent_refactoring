    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=28, nof=2, nom=2 (nopm=1). Complexity is low (WMC=5) and cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or would benefit from further decomposition."
