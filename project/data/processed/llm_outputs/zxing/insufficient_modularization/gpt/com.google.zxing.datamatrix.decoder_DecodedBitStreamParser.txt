    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=432) and very high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=103) indicate it combines many control paths and responsibilities in one unit. Although it has a moderate number of methods (nom=11), the extreme WMC implies those methods are large/complex and could be split. The class has multiple dependencies (com.google.zxing.common.BitSource, com.google.zxing.common.ECIStringBuilder, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser.Mode and FormatException), suggesting it handles multiple concerns (bitstream parsing, ECI handling, mode-specific decoding). Together these metrics (loc, wmc, nom) and the dependency set justify detecting Insufficient Modularization for this class."
