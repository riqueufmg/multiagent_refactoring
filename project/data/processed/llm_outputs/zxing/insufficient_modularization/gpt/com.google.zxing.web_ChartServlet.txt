    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 115) combined with a high complexity concentration (wmc = 15) spread across few methods (nom = 4) — average complexity ≈ 3.75 per method, indicating large/complex methods that could be decomposed. It also has multiple external dependencies (6 listed) which suggests it handles several responsibilities. Although cohesion is high (lcom = 0.0), the high WMC with low NOM and substantial LOC indicates the class has not been fully decomposed and would likely benefit from further modularization."
