    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=12, number of methods=2, fields=1, WMC=2 indicating low complexity, LCOM=0.0 indicating high cohesion. No inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or would benefit from further decomposition."
