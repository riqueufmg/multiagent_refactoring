    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of fields (nof=38, nopf=38) while exposing almost no behavior (nom=1, wmc=1). It spans 193 lines of code (loc=193) but contains very few methods, indicating it is primarily a container of many fields/constants rather than a focused, decomposed unit. These metrics (high field count and LOC combined with minimal methods/complexity) indicate the class has not been sufficiently modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size and improve modularity."
