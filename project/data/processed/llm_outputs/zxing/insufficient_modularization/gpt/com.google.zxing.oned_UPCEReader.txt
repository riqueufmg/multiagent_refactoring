    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively high implementation complexity (WMC = 19) for a small number of methods (nom = 7) and moderate size (LOC = 96) indicates concentrated complexity. Cohesion is moderate/low (LCOM = 0.571), suggesting multiple responsibilities or weakly related methods. Only 2 public methods (nopm = 2) versus 7 total methods implies several internal behaviors that could be extracted into separate classes or helpers. These elements together justify that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
