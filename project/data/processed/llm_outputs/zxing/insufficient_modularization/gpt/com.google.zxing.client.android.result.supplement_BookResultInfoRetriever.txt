    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: low LOC (53) and small number of methods (nom=2) and fields (nof=3) show limited size; WMC=7 is moderate and not excessively complex; LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion (no sign of multiple unrelated responsibilities). Dependency count is small. Taken in isolation, the class is compact and cohesive, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
