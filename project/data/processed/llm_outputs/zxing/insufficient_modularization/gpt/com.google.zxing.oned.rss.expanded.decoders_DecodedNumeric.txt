    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=32, NOM=6, WMC=7 (moderate complexity), NOF=3 (few fields). LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 and only one external dependency (FormatException) show low coupling. Given the low size, moderate complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
