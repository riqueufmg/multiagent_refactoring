    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=19, number of methods (nom)=1, WMC=3 (low complexity), no fields (nof=0), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). Fan-in=0 and fan-out=0 indicate minimal coupling. Given its single responsibility and low complexity, there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
