    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.AbstractExpandedDecoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows concentrated complexity despite small size: WMC = 19 with only nom = 5 methods (average complexity ≈ 3.8 per method) and LOC = 49, indicating complex methods that could be decomposed. LCOM = 0.4 indicates only moderate cohesion, suggesting multiple responsibilities or separable concerns inside the class. There are few public methods (nopm = 2) but nontrivial internal complexity, and DIT = 0 (no inheritance to distribute behavior). These factors (high WMC relative to small LOC and low-to-moderate cohesion) justify Insufficient Modularization: the class likely can be decomposed to reduce implementation complexity."
