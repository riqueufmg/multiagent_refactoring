    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=38, NOM=8, NOF=3. Complexity is moderate (WMC=9) but not high, and cohesion is maximal (LCOM=0.0). Coupling is minimal in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies are listed. These metrics indicate the class is already sufficiently modular and does not show signs that further decomposition is needed."
