    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=151) and high complexity (wmc=26) indicate substantial internal logic; total methods nom=7 but only one public method (nopm=1) — many private helpers suggest multiple responsibilities that could be split; very few fields (nof=1) so complexity is behavioral and amenable to decomposition; cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.2857) and does not offset the high complexity; minimal external dependencies (depends on com.google.zxing.client.j2se.StringsResourceTranslator) and zero fan-in/fan-out imply decomposition can be done in isolation. These elements justify recommending further decomposition."
