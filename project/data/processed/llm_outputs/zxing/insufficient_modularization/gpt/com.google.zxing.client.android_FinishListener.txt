    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=19, nom=4, wmc=4, nof=1. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0) and there is no inheritance or coupling pressure (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size, low complexity, few methods/fields, and lack of external dependencies, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
