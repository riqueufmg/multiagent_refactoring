    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.VCardContactEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation complexity (WMC = 27) combined with a small number of methods (NOM = 5) and moderate size (LOC = 81) indicates that methods are large/complex and the class carries substantial internal logic. Only one public method (NOPM = 1) with the remainder likely implemented as many private helpers suggests internal behavior that could be split into smaller classes. The class also depends on two formatter components (VCardFieldFormatter, Formatter), implying multiple concerns (formatting + encoding) that could be separated. These elements together justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is detected."
