    "justification": "Class is very small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=7, number of fields=2, number of methods=0, WMC=0 (no internal complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion indicator is high (LCOM=-1.0). DIT=1 and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not suffering from insufficient modularization."
