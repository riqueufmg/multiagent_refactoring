    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.GeneratorException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=9, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=0, NOPF=0, DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and no dependencies. There is a single method and no fields or complex structure to decompose. Given these metrics and the requirement to analyze the class in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
