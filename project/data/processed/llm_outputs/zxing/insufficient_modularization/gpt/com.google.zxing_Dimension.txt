    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=33, NOF=2, NOM=6, WMC=8 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size and maintained cohesion. No external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies). Given these metrics and analyzing the class in isolation, there is no evidence it is insufficiently modularized or that it requires further decomposition."
