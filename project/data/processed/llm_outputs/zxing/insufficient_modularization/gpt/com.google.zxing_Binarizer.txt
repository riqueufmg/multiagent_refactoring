    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=39, NOM=7, WMC=7 indicate low implementation size and manageable complexity. LCOM=0.428 shows reasonable cohesion. It has only 1 field (NOF=1) and no reported fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0), so there is no evidence the class bundles unrelated responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition."
