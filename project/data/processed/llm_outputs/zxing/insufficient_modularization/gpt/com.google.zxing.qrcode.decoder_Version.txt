    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class. Although the class has moderate size (loc=163) and complexity (wmc=23), it has high cohesion (lcom=0.1666) and a modest number of methods (nom=12) and fields (nof=10). These values suggest a single, cohesive responsibility rather than a class that should be split; therefore further decomposition is not clearly warranted from the provided metrics."
