    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ModulusPoly",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and complex: 192 LOC, 13 methods (nom=13) and a high weighted method count (WMC=46). It has only 2 fields (nof=2) but concentrates many behaviors in a single type, indicating multiple responsibilities and implementation complexity that could be split. The class has no inheritance (dit=0, nc=0) and only one external dependency, suggesting its functionality is self-contained and amenable to decomposition. These metrics together justify detection of Insufficient Modularization."
