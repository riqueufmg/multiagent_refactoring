    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (LOC=18), has a single method (nom=1, nopm=1), low complexity (WMC=3), no fields (nof=0), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependencies are limited to expected parser/result types. There is no metric evidence of excessive size or multiple responsibilities that would justify further decomposition."
