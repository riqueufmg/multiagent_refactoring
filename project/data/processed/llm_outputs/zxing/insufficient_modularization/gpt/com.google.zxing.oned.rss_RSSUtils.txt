    "justification": "Class is small and focused: LOC=64, number of methods nom=3 (nopm=1), indicating limited surface area. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0), so methods are related. Although WMC=14 shows some internal complexity, it is concentrated in a few methods rather than many responsibilities. Fan-in=0 and fan-out=0 show no coupling evidence that would motivate splitting. Overall metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
