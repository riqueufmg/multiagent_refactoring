    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=44, NOM=7, NOF=2. Cohesion is good (LCOM=0.2857). Complexity is moderate but not excessive (WMC=10) given the small size. Low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a few external dependencies (3) suggest it does not contain multiple unrelated responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
