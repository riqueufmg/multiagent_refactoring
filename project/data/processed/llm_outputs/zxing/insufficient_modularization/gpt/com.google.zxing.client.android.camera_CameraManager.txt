    "justification": "The class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: large size (loc = 245) and many methods (nom = 14, nopm = 13) indicate multiple responsibilities; high complexity (wmc = 38) suggests complex internal logic that could be split; substantial state (nof = 17) increases maintenance burden; dependencies on multiple distinct camera components (CameraConfigurationManager, PreviewCallback, OpenCameraInterface, OpenCamera, AutoFocusManager) imply it coordinates configuration, preview, camera opening and autofocus responsibilities that could be separated into smaller classes."
