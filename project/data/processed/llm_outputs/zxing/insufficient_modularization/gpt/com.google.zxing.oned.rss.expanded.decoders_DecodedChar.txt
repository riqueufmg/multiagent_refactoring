    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=18, NOM=3, NOF=2 and WMC=3 indicating low implementation complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion. Fanout=0 and no dependencies indicate no coupling that would suggest further decomposition. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or would benefit from further decomposition."
