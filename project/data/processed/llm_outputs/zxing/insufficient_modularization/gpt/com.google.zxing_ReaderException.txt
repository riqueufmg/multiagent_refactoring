    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=24), low complexity (wmc=4), few methods (nom=4), and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion, the class is very small and simple, so further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity."
