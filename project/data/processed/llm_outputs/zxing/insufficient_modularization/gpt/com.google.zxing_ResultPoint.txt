    "class": "com.google.zxing.ResultPoint",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=82, NOF=2 (few fields), NOM=9 with NOPM=8 (manageable number of methods), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). Complexity is moderate (WMC=13) and there is a single external dependency (MathUtils). These metrics indicate the class is compact and focused rather than a large, undivided unit that requires further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
