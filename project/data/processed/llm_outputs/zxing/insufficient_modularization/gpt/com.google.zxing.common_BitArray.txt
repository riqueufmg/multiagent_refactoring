    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.BitArray",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high cyclomatic complexity (WMC = 58), a large number of methods (NOM = 27) with most exposed as public (NOPM = 24), and a sizeable implementation (LOC = 279). At the same time it has few fields (NOF = 4), indicating many behaviors concentrated around a small internal state. These metrics together indicate the class likely contains multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
