    "justification": "Large size and concentrated complexity: loc=326 and wmc=79 indicate a large, highly complex implementation. Very few methods (nom=3, nopm=1) imply complexity is concentrated inside a small number of large methods rather than distributed across well-factored operations. A relatively high number of fields (nof=16) suggests multiple responsibilities/state that could be separated. DIT=1 and fanin/fanout=0 do not mitigate the internal complexity. Together these metrics indicate the class is insufficiently modular and would benefit from decomposition into smaller classes/methods."
