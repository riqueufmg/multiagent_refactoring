    "justification": "Low cohesion (LCOM=1.0) combined with relatively high complexity (WMC=8) despite a small number of methods (nom=2, nopm=1) and moderate size (loc=52) indicates the class concentrates multiple, uncohesive responsibilities in a few complex methods; presence of dependencies on UPCEReader, UPCEANReader and BarcodeFormat suggests it mixes encoding logic and format-specific concerns; these factors together justify that further decomposition could reduce method complexity and improve modularization."
