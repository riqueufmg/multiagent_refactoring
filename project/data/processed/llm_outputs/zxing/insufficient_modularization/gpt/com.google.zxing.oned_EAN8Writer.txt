    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: small number of methods (nom=2, nopm=1) but relatively large size (loc=52) and elevated complexity (wmc=7) — indicating one or more large, complex methods that likely contain multiple responsibilities. Low cohesion (lcom=1.0) supports that the contained functionality is not well-separated. Additionally, fanin=0 and fanout=0 imply the class is self-contained (not decomposed via collaborators). These elements together justify decomposing the class into smaller, more cohesive units."
