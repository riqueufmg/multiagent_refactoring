    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size and complexity: LOC=320 and WMC=65 indicate a large, complex class. API and surface area: nom=15 methods (nopm=6 public) and nof=5 fields (nopf=2 public) suggest multiple responsibilities and a nontrivial public surface. Cohesion and maintainability: lcom=0.4 shows only moderate cohesion. Together these metrics justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization (splitting responsibilities, reducing method complexity and class size)."
