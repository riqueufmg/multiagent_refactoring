    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate a likely need for decomposition: moderate size (loc=95) with relatively high complexity (wmc=16) concentrated across few methods (nom=5, nopm=3). Cohesion is not strong (lcom=0.4), suggesting multiple responsibilities within the class. The class depends on many external components (Decoder, DetectorResult, BitMatrix, Result/ResultMetadataType, ResultPoint, BinaryBitmap, DecodeHintType, NotFoundException, DecoderResult), which implies it handles decoding, detection, and result construction logic together. Additionally, there is no inheritance (dit=0), so functionality is implemented in this single class rather than being distributed. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
