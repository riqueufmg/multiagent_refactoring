    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=25, WMC=5, NOM=5, NOF=2 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size, low complexity, and high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency ParsedResultType) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). Given these metrics the class does not appear to need further decomposition."
