    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High complexity and size indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=145 and WMC=33 show a large, complex class; nof=6 fields with nom=7 methods (nopm=3 public) imply substantial internal state and behavior concentrated in one class; LCOM=0.4286 indicates only moderate cohesion (methods are not fully focused on a single responsibility); DIT=1 shows little decomposition via inheritance. Together these metrics justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition."
