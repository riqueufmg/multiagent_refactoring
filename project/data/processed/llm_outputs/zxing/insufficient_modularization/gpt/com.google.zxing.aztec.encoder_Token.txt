    "justification": "High lack-of-cohesion (lcom = 0.8) indicates the class groups unrelated responsibilities; combined with 5 methods (nom = 5) and a moderate cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 5) this suggests internal complexity concentrated in a single class. Although the file is small (loc = 17) and has only 2 fields (nof = 2), the low cohesion implies the behavior could be split into clearer, smaller modules. fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show it is self-contained, and the single external dependency (com.google.zxing.common.BitArray) suggests decomposition would mainly affect internal organization rather than external coupling—supporting detection of Insufficient Modularization."
