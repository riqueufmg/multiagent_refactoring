    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has only 2 methods (nom=2) but a high cyclomatic/weight measure (wmc=15), implying large or highly complex methods (avg complexity ~7.5 per method). The file is relatively small (loc=42) yet the concentration of complexity into very few methods indicates behavior that could be further decomposed. fanout=0 and fanin=0 show the class is not delegating or splitting responsibilities through interactions, increasing the likelihood that those methods encapsulate multiple responsibilities. These elements (nom=2, wmc=15, loc=42, fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate insufficient modularization."
