    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=33, 2 methods (nom=2), 1 field (nof=1), low complexity (WMC=4). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only two dependencies (HistoryItem, Result). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and focused, so there is no evidence it requires further decomposition."
