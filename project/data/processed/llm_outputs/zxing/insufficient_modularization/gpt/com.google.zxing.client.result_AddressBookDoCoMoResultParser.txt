    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=36, number of methods=2 (public methods=1), WMC=6 (moderate complexity for very few methods), LCOM=-1.0 indicating high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=2). These metrics show no sign that the class is too large or insufficiently decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
