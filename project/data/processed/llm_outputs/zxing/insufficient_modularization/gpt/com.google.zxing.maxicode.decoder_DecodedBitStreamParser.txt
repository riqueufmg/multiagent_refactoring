    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High internal complexity and size indicate insufficient modularization: WMC = 33 (high complexity concentrated in the class) while there are only 10 methods (suggesting large/complex methods); LOC = 137 (substantial implementation size); a large number of fields (22) implies the class holds many pieces of state/behavior. Although LCOM = 0.2 does not show strong lack of cohesion, the combination of high WMC, many fields, and considerable LOC supports that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
