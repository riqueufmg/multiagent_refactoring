    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=14, WMC=3, NOM=3 (NOPM=3), NOF=0, NOPF=0. Coupling is nil (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]), NC=0, LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion. Given the small size, low complexity, no fields and no external dependencies, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modular or requires further decomposition."
