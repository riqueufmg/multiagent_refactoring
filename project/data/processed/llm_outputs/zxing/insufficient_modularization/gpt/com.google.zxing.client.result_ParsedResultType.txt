    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal complexity: LOC=5, NOF=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, WMC=0. It has no fields/methods to decompose and no coupling or dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM=-1.0 indicates lack of applicable cohesion data. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
