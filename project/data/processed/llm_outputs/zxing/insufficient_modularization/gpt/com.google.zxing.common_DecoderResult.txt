    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.DecoderResult",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 20), high weighted method complexity (wmc = 20), and substantial size (loc = 113) combined with a relatively large number of fields (nof = 11). These metrics indicate the class is sizeable and complex and could likely be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. (Note: cohesion reported as lcom = 0.2, which is relatively low and does not rule out decomposition given the other complexity/size indicators.)"
