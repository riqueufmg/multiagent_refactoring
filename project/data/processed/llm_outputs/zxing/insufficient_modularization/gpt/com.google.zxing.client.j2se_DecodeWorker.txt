    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecodeWorker",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of insufficient modularization: it is relatively large (LOC = 186) and highly complex (WMC = 31) while exposing very few public entry points (nopm = 1 across nom = 7 methods). It has a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 6) and a broad set of dependencies (e.g., MultiFormatReader, MultipleBarcodeReader, ResultParser, BufferedImageLuminanceSource, BinaryBitmap, BitMatrix, BitArray, ImageReader, ResultPoint, LuminanceSource, DecoderConfig) which indicates it performs multiple responsibilities and coordinates many collaborators. The combination of high method complexity, substantial size, many internal fields, and many external dependencies (all evaluated in isolation) suggests the class has not been decomposed enough and would benefit from splitting into smaller, more focused classes or components."
