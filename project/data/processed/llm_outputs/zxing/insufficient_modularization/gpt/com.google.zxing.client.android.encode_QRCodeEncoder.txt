    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.QRCodeEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization detected based on the class-internal metrics and its dependency set: the class is large (LOC=266) with high implementation complexity (WMC=57) and a relatively large API/behavior surface (NOM=15, NOF=9). It depends on many distinct concerns/types (BitMatrix, Contents, BarcodeFormat, Result, EncodeHintType, ResultParser, ParsedResult, AddressBookParsedResult, ContactEncoder, Intents), which indicates multiple responsibilities (parsing, encoding, contact/address handling, intent-related logic). The class has no inheritance decomposition (DIT=0), suggesting functionality is concentrated in this single class rather than split across smaller, focused classes. These elements together justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
