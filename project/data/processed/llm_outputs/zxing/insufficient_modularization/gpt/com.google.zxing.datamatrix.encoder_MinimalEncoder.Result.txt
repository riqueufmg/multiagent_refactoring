    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.MinimalEncoder.Result",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has 81 LOC but reports 0 methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and 1 field (nof = 1), indicating a relatively large implementation without decomposition into methods or subcomponents. WMC = 0 alongside high LOC suggests logic is not split into smaller routines. Low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and a single dependency (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.MinimalEncoder) imply the class is isolated and could be safely decomposed. These elements together justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
