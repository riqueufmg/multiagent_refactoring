    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ErrorCorrection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High overall size and complexity concentrated in few methods: LOC=129 and WMC=23 while NOM=5 (only NOPM=2 public) indicate large, complex methods rather than a finer-grained decomposition. NOF=1 (single field) and low public API surface suggest internal responsibilities are concentrated inside the class. Although LCOM=0 shows cohesion, the combination of high LOC and high WMC with few methods is a strong sign that the class could be further decomposed to reduce method size and implementation complexity."
