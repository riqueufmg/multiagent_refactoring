    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=21, WMC=4, NOM=3, NOF=3. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Low complexity and small size (few methods/fields) do not suggest an incomplete decomposition. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show no broad coupling that would require splitting. Therefore, based on these metrics the class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
