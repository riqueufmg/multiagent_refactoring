    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class: loc=92 and nom=3 (only three methods) show modest size; wmc=16 indicates moderate overall complexity but not a large, monolithic implementation; nof=2 (two fields) limits state to manage; lcom=0.0 indicates high cohesion among members; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show low coupling in the provided isolation view. Although there are several external dependencies, the small number of methods, low field count, and high cohesion argue against Insufficient Modularization."
