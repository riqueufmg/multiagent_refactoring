    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class is large and complex in isolation: LOC = 595 and WMC = 94 indicate very high implementation size and cyclomatic complexity; NOM = 18 and NOF = 21 show many methods/fields concentrated in a single class. Although LCOM = 0.111 suggests methods are reasonably cohesive, the extremely high WMC and LOC imply the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would likely benefit from further modularization (splitting large methods/responsibilities into smaller classes or helpers) to reduce size and complexity."
