    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.OneDimensionalCodeWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: it has 9 methods (nom = 9) with 5 public methods (nopm = 5) concentrated in a single class, relatively high implementation complexity (wmc = 18) and a non-trivial size (loc = 98). Cohesion is relatively low (lcom = 0.3333333333333333) while holding only one field (nof = 1), suggesting methods are not well-grouped around state and could be split into smaller, more cohesive classes. Additionally, there is no inheritance (dit = 0) and no measured coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), which indicates responsibilities are concentrated in this class rather than distributed. These elements together justify recommending further decomposition."
