    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undivided, overly large or complex class: low number of methods (nom=2), low weighted method count (wmc=4), moderate size (loc=85) but not large, few fields (nof=5), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only one listed dependency (com.google.zxing.web.LRUMap). These elements suggest the class is small, cohesive and not a clear candidate for further decomposition."
