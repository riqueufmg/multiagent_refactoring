    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=16, NOM=1, WMC=2 indicate minimal size and low complexity. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 with only 2 declared dependencies show low coupling. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Given the single method and low metrics, there is no evidence this class needs further decomposition."
