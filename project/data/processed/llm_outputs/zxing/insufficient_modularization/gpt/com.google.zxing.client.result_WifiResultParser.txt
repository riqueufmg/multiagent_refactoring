    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=33 and only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and LCOM indicates cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Although the single method's complexity is moderately high (wmc=6), the class itself does not show signs of being a large, multi-responsibility unit that needs decomposition. Therefore there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
