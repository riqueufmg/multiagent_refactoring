    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Insufficient modularization detected: the class holds a large amount of state relative to its behavior (nof=10 fields vs nom=4 methods, nopm=3 public methods), with many public fields (nopf=8) implying poor encapsulation and likely multiple responsibilities. LCOM=1.0 indicates very low cohesion between methods and fields. WMC=7 with LOC=54 shows nontrivial complexity concentrated in few methods. The high fields-to-methods ratio (10/4=2.5) and public-fields-to-public-methods ratio (8/3≈2.7) justify further decomposition to reduce size, complexity, and improve cohesion."
