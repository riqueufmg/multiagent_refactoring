    "justification": "Class is small and simple: nom=1 (one method), nopm=1 (one public method), loc=10, wmc=1. Coupling is minimal: fanin=0, fanout=0. Cohesion is not indicative of multiple responsibilities: lcom=-1.0. Inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). Given the very low size and complexity metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
