    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=15, WMC=2, NOM=2, NOF=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). No inheritance (DIT=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one listed dependency. Given its low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
