    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large size (loc=614) and high complexity (wmc=41) indicate the class encompasses many responsibilities; 13 methods and 13 fields (nom=13, nof=13) with average ~47 LOC per method (614/13) point to bulky methods that could be split; presence of multiple nested/related types in dependencies (MinimalEncoder.Edge, MinimalEncoder.Mode, MinimalEncoder.Result, MinimalEncoder.Input) suggests multiple concerns that could be extracted into separate classes; moderate cohesion (lcom=0.3077) instead of high cohesion supports that the class is not tightly focused. These elements together justify that the class can be further decomposed (insufficient modularization)."
