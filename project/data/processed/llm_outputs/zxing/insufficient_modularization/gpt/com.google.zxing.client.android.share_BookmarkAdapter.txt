    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=35, NOM=5, WMC=6 (no high complexity), LCOM=0.4 (moderate/acceptable cohesion). It has few fields (NOF=2, NOPF=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large or complex class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
