    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement.SupplementalInfoRetriever",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high complexity (wmc = 25) and moderate size (loc = 121) with a relatively small number of methods (nom = 8) and many fields (nof = 6), indicating methods and state are doing multiple duties. Cohesion is moderate/low (lcom = 0.625), and there are few public entry points (nopm = 2) suggesting substantial internal behavior that could be split out. The class depends on multiple specialized retriever types (BookResultInfoRetriever, TitleRetriever, ProductResultInfoRetriever, URIResultInfoRetriever) plus ParsedResult/ProductParsedResult and HistoryManager, which implies it aggregates distinct responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, focused classes. These metrics and dependencies together justify refactoring into smaller modules to reduce per-class complexity and improve cohesion."
