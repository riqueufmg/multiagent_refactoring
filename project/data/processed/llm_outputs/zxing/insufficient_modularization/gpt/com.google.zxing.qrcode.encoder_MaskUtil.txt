    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MaskUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: moderate size (LOC=161) combined with high cyclomatic/complexity load (WMC=38) and 9 methods (avg complexity ≈4.2) indicates concentrated complexity. Cohesion is low (LCOM=0.666...), suggesting multiple responsibilities or weakly related methods/fields (4 fields) that could be separated. DIT=0 and no external fan-in/fan-out do not mitigate the internal complexity. The single dependency (ByteMatrix) and the metric profile imply the class could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive units to reduce size and implementation complexity."
