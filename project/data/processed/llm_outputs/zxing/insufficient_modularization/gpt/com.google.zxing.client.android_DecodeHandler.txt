    "justification": "The class shows a small surface and cohesive design: only 4 methods (nom=4) and 3 fields (nof=3) with 69 LOC, suggesting limited size. The LCOM value is 0.0, indicating high cohesion among members. Although WMC is 11, this single elevated complexity number is not accompanied by a large number of methods or excessive lines that would indicate an undecomposed class. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, so there is no evidence of broad coupling that would signal multiple responsibilities. Based on these metrics (nom=4, nof=3, loc=69, lcom=0.0, wmc=11, fanin=0, fanout=0) there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization."
