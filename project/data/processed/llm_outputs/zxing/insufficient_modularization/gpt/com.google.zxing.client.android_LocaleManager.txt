    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs that further decomposition would reduce size/complexity: LOC=134 and WMC=13 indicate non-trivial size and complexity; NOM=10 methods and NOF=7 fields suggest multiple responsibilities; LCOM=0.4 shows only moderate cohesion (some methods/fields are not tightly related). Additionally, FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 imply low coupling to other classes, so responsibilities can be separated without heavy dependency impact. Based on these metrics in isolation, refactoring into smaller, more focused classes is warranted."
