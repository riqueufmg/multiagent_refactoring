    "justification": "LCOM = 0.6666666666666666 (low cohesion) combined with WMC = 7 while NOM = 3 indicates that a small number of methods contain relatively high complexity and likely multiple responsibilities. NOPM = 1 (only one public method) suggests internal/private methods are doing distinct work. These signs point to insufficient decomposition of responsibilities and that further modularization (splitting complex/private behaviors out) could reduce complexity and improve cohesion."
