    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that has not been decomposed: small size (LOC=40), few methods (nom=4) and only one field (nof=1); low public surface (nopm=1) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). Although WMC=9 shows some internal complexity, it is concentrated in a small number of methods and LCOM=0.5 indicates moderate cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Taken in isolation, these values do not justify further decomposition."
