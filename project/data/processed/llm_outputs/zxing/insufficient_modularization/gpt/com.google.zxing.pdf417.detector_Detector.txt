    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=259) combined with high complexity (wmc=42) indicates heavy implementation inside a single class; a relatively high number of fields (nof=13) with a small number of methods (nom=9, nopm=1) suggests many responsibilities and/or large method bodies rather than decomposition into focused collaborators; although LCOM=0.222 indicates some cohesion, it does not offset the class-level complexity and size. Dependencies are limited to a few types, implying the complexity is internal to this class. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization and recommend splitting responsibilities into smaller classes or extracting helper components."
