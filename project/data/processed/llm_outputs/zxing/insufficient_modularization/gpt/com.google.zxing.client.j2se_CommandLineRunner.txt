    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.CommandLineRunner",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High cyclomatic complexity (WMC = 26) combined with non-trivial size (LOC = 118) indicates concentrated complexity. The class has few methods (NOM = 6) but only one public entry point (NOPM = 1), implying significant logic is packed into a small set of methods. The class also interacts with DecoderConfig and DecodeWorker, suggesting it is shouldering multiple responsibilities (configuration/argument handling plus decoding orchestration). These metrics and dependencies, considered in isolation, point to Insufficient Modularization and warrant decomposition (e.g., separate argument parsing/config handling and decoding orchestration)."
