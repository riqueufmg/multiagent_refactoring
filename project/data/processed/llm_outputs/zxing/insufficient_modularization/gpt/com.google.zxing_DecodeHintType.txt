    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=53, WMC=2 (low complexity), NOM=2, NOF=1. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. No inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size, low complexity, few responsibilities and high cohesion, there is no evidence this class requires further decomposition."
