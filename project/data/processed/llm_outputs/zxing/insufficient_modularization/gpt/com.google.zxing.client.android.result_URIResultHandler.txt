    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has 7 methods (nom = 7, nopm = 7) but only 2 fields (nof = 2), indicating many behaviors per internal state. Its cyclomatic complexity is high (wmc = 14) for a 50-line class (loc = 50), increasing implementation complexity. Cohesion is low/highly scattered (lcom = 0.857), which strongly suggests multiple responsibilities that could be separated. The lack of deeper inheritance (dit = 1) and zero fan-in/fan-out (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) mean the complexity is concentrated in this class rather than distributed, supporting the need for further decomposition."
