    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.ScanFromWebPageManager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=40), low complexity (wmc=4), few methods (nom=4), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependencies are limited (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.client.android.result.ResultHandler). These metrics indicate the class is compact and cohesive, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided data."
