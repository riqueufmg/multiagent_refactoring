    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=28, WMC=5, NOM=5, NOF=4. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Low complexity and size do not suggest further decomposition. No external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0) — in isolation there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
