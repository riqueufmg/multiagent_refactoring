    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeFormatManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it declares 9 fields while exposing only 4 methods (nof=9, nom=4), which indicates a high state-to-behavior ratio and suggests multiple responsibilities or grouped data that could be split. Size and complexity are non-trivial (loc=60, wmc=9), and cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.5), implying the class's methods do not operate uniformly over a single cohesive set of fields. These metrics together justify decomposing the class to reduce size and implementation complexity."
