    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=39, NOM=3, NOF=1, WMC=7. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. There is no evidence of high coupling or responsibility overload: FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, DIT=0, NC=0. Given the low size, low method count, single field and strong cohesion, there is no indication that further decomposition is needed."
