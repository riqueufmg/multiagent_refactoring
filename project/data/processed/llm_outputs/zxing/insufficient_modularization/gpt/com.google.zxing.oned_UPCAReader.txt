    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=39, NOM=7, LCOM=0.2857 (low — good cohesion). Complexity is modest: WMC=9. Coupling is low: FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and only a few external dependencies. Inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=2) and there are few fields (NOF=1). These metrics indicate the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
