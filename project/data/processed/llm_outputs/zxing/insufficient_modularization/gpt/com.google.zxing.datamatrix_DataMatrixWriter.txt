    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation complexity concentrated in few methods: WMC = 25 while NOM = 4 (NOPM = 2) indicates very complex methods that likely bundle multiple responsibilities. Size is non-trivial (LOC = 138). The class depends on many encoder/placement/error-correction related types (ErrorCorrection, HighLevelEncoder, DefaultPlacement, SymbolInfo, MinimalEncoder, ByteMatrix, etc.), indicating it coordinates multiple concerns (encoding, placement, error correction, symbol selection). Together these metrics and dependencies point to insufficient modularization (the class should be decomposed to reduce per-method complexity and separate responsibilities)."
