    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 405) and high complexity (wmc = 65) indicate heavy implementation burden concentrated in one class; relatively few methods (nom = 8) combined with high WMC implies large/complex methods that could be split; a substantial number of fields (nof = 21) suggests multiple responsibilities or state that could be factored out; presence of inner/nested types referenced (Code128Writer.Charset, Code128Writer.CType, Code128Writer.Latch) implies internal responsibilities that are candidates for extraction into separate classes. Although cohesion metric (lcom = 0.25) is not extreme, it does not outweigh the class size and complexity signals—refactoring into smaller, focused classes would likely reduce LOC and WMC and improve modularization."
