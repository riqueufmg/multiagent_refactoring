    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=64, NOM=5 (NOPM=4), NOF=1. Complexity is moderate/low: WMC=8. Cohesion is high: LCOM=0.0. Low external coupling in provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0) and limited dependencies (4). These metrics indicate the class is not excessively large or complex and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
