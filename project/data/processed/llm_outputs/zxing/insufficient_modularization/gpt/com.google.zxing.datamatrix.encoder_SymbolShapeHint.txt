    "justification": "Class has extremely small size and complexity: LOC=4, no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no listed dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not exhibit symptoms of insufficient modularization."
