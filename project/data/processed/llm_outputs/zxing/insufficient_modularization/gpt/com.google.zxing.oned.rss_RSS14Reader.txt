    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.RSS14Reader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=362) and very high cyclomatic complexity (wmc=73) indicate heavy implementation complexity concentrated in this single class. It has a moderate number of methods (nom=11) but few public APIs (nopm=3), implying many complex private helpers and responsibilities hidden in the class. It also has a substantial number of fields (nof=9) and depends on many other types (12 listed dependencies), suggesting the class coordinates multiple concerns. The high WMC relative to method count (avg complexity >6 per method) and overall LOC support that further decomposition (splitting complex methods or responsibilities into separate classes/modules) would likely reduce size and complexity."
