    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class defines a large number of fields (nof=23, nopf=23) while having no methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and occupies 96 LOC. A high field count combined with zero behavior indicates the class is acting as a bulky data/constant holder with multiple responsibilities or groupings embedded in one unit. This size and lack of decomposition suggest it can be split into smaller, more focused classes or modules to improve modularization and reduce class size/complexity."
