    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC=130 and NOM=14 show moderate size; NOF=6 fields is small-to-moderate; LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion (methods operate on shared state) so responsibilities are not scattered; DIT=0 and fanin/fanout=0 show no inheritance or high coupling that would demand splitting. WMC=28 shows some internal complexity, but given the high cohesion and limited size, there is insufficient evidence that the class should be decomposed further."
