    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=19, NOM=2, WMC=2, NOPM=1, NOF=0. It has no fields, no children (NC=0), no inheritance depth (DIT=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single external dependency. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. These metrics show low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
