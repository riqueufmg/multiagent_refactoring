    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.BitMatrixParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: high size (loc=175) and high complexity (wmc=35) concentrated in a single class with 8 methods (nom=8) and 4 fields (nof=4). Its dependencies (com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, Version, FormatInformation, DataMask, FormatException) indicate it handles multiple concerns (format information parsing, version extraction, data mask handling and bit reading/exception handling) within one unit. The combination of large LOC and high WMC suggests the implementation could be decomposed into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
