    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive (loc=77, nom=4, nopm=1) with no fields (nof=0) and high cohesion indicated by LCOM=-1.0. Although WMC=13 shows some internal complexity, the limited number of methods and a single public interface reduce the need for further decomposition. Coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=1), so there is insufficient evidence that the class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
