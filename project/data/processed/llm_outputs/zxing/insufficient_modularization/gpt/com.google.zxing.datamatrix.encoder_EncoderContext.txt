    "justification": "nom=21 and nopm=19 (many methods, most publicly accessible), nof=9 (several fields), loc=89 and wmc=24 (relatively high complexity). The large number of methods and public behaviors combined with nontrivial complexity indicate the class is doing multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size/complexity. (Dependencies: com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.SymbolInfo, com.google.zxing.Dimension, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.SymbolShapeHint.)"
