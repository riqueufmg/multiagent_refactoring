    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.WifiParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: nominal size (loc=63) and moderate complexity (wmc=12) are not large, number of methods (nom=12) and fields (nof=8) are reasonable, and cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). Low inheritance depth (dit=1) and zero coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate the class is cohesive and not overly complex or entangled, so further decomposition is not indicated."
