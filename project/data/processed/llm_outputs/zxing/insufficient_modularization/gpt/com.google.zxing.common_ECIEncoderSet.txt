    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.ECIEncoderSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has moderate size (LOC=110) and relatively high implementation complexity (WMC=21) with 9 methods (NOM=9, NOPM=9). It has no inheritance (DIT=0) so complexity is concentrated in this single class, and fan-in/fan-out are 0 indicating it is a self-contained, potentially monolithic unit. These indicators (high WMC relative to size, multiple public methods) suggest the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
