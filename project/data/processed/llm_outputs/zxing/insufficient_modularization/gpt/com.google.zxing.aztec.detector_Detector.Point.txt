    "justification": "Class has very small size and low complexity: loc=20, nof=2 (only two fields), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods/low complexity). Low coupling: fanin=0 and fanout=0. These metrics indicate a simple data holder already minimally decomposed, so there is no evidence that further modularization is needed."
