    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.AnyAIDecoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=14, WMC=2, NOM=2 (NOPM=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). These metrics indicate low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further. LCOM=1.0 does not, in this context, suggest a large, monolithic class. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
