    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=17, NOF=1, NOM=3 (NOPM=2), WMC=3 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low complexity and high cohesion. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 show no coupling pressure. DIT=1 is minimal. These metrics do not justify further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
