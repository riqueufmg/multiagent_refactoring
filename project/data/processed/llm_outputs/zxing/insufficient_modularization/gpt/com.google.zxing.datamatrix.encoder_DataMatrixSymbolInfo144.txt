    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=11), low method count (nom=3) and few public methods (nopm=2), low complexity (wmc=3), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (dit=1) and no evidence of low cohesion (lcom=-1.0). These elements suggest the class is already small and modular, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
