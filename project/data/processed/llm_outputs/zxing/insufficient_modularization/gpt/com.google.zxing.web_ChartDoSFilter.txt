    "justification": "The class is trivial and not a candidate for further decomposition: very small size (loc=5), no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate there is no remaining internal complexity or size to justify modularization."
