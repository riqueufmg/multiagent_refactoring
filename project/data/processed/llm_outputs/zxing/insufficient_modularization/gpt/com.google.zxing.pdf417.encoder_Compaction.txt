    "justification": "Class is minimal and shows no signs of under-modularization: very small size (loc = 4), no methods (nom = 0) and no public fields (nopf = 0), zero complexity (wmc = 0), zero fan-in/fan-out and no dependencies. These metrics indicate no substantial implementation to decompose further, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
