    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and does not exhibit signs of needing further decomposition: LOC=61 (small), NOM=5 methods (few responsibilities), WMC=10 (moderate complexity but not high for 5 methods), NOF=5 fields (reasonable relative to methods), LCOM=0.4 (moderate-to-good cohesion). Additionally fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate low coupling to other code within the provided context. Given these metrics and the isolated dependency set (BitArray, NotFoundException), there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
