    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 224 (large size), WMC = 47 (high complexity), NOM = 14 (many methods) and NOPM = 1 (only one public method with many internal helpers). These values indicate a large, complex implementation that could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity; additionally the class appears isolated (fanin=0, fanout=0), which makes safe decomposition more feasible."
