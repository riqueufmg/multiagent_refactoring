    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: loc=4, nom=2, wmc=2 indicating low implementation size and complexity. Fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling pressure requiring decomposition. lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion concerns in the provided data). Only one listed dependency (EncoderContext). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized."
