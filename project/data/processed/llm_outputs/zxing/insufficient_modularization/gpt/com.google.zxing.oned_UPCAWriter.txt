    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=16, NOM=2, WMC=3. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and there are minimal fields (NOF=1). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating low coupling. These metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed or overly complex class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
