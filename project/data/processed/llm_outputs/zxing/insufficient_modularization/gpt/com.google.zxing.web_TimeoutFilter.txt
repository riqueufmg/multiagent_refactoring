    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small (LOC=43) with few methods (NOM=4) and fields (NOF=3), moderate complexity (WMC=7) and moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.5). It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and not clearly under-modularized in isolation."
