    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=21), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]), and LCOM does not suggest decomposition need. The class is simple and lacks the size/complexity indicators that would justify further decomposition."
