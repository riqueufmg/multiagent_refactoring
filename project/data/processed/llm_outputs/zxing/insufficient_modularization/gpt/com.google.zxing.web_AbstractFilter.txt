    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.AbstractFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it's very small (loc=14) with few methods (nom=3, nopm=2), low complexity (wmc=3), high cohesion (lcom=-1.0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no inheritance depth (dit=0). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and simple, so there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
