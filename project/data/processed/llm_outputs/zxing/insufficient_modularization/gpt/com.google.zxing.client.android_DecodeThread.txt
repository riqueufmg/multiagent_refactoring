    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeThread",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation complexity concentrated in few methods (wmc=12 with nom=3 and nopm=1) and moderate size (loc=61) indicates large/complex methods that can be split. A relatively high number of fields (nof=6) for only a few methods suggests the class holds multiple pieces of state/responsibility. The class depends on many collaborators (com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity, DecodeHandler, PreferencesActivity, ResultPointCallback, DecodeHintType, DecodeFormatManager), implying it coordinates several concerns. Together these metrics and dependencies indicate the class is insufficiently modularized and could be decomposed further."
