    "justification": "High implementation size and complexity indicate insufficient modularization: LOC = 184 and WMC = 36 (WMC well above typical decomposition thresholds) with nom = 13 methods and nof = 9 fields. These values show many behaviors and internal state that can be split. Although LCOM = 0.1538461538461538 suggests reasonable cohesion, the combination of high WMC and moderate LOC/method count supports that the class has not been fully decomposed. Dependencies (com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard.ClipboardInterface, com.google.zxing.client.android.Contents, com.google.zxing.client.android.Intents) do not reduce the internal complexity, so refactoring into smaller classes/modules is advisable."
