    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive — 73 LOC, only 2 fields (nof=2) and 4 methods (nom=4), with very high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Although WMC=15 indicates some internal complexity, the low method and field counts and minimal dependencies (ErrorCorrectionLevel, Version) suggest complexity is localized to method logic rather than an undecomposed class structure; no evidence that splitting the class would reduce size or implementation complexity overall."
