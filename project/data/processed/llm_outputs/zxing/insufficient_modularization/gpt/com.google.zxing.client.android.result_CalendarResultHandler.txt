    "justification": "Size and complexity indicate insufficient modularization: LOC = 104 and WMC = 18 (high cyclomatic complexity). The class exposes many behaviors: NOM = 8 with NOPM = 6 (many public methods), while cohesion is low (LCOM = 0.625), suggesting multiple responsibilities. With only NOF = 2 fields, the relatively large method set operating on few fields further suggests behavior is spread across methods rather than being a focused, cohesive unit — a candidate for decomposition."
