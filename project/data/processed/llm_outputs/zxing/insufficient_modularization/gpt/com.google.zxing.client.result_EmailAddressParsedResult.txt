    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undivided large or overly complex class: LOC=60 (small), NOM=10 with NOPM=8 (moderate number of methods), WMC=10 (moderate complexity), NOF=5 (small state), LCOM=0.3 (reasonably cohesive). DIT=1 and fanin/fanout=0 show low coupling and no deep inheritance. Considering the class in isolation, there is no strong evidence (high size, high complexity, low cohesion or high coupling) to warrant further decomposition."
