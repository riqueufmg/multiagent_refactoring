    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=38, NOM=7, NOF=6, WMC=7 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size and moderate complexity with high cohesion. DIT=0 and negligible coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single external dependency) further suggest no need for further decomposition when considered in isolation."
