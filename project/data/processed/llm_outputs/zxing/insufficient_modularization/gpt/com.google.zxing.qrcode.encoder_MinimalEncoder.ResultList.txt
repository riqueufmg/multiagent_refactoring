    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MinimalEncoder.ResultList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (loc=170) while containing a relatively high number of fields (nof=6) but no declared methods (nom=0, wmc=0). It also depends on multiple concepts (com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Mode, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Version) and shows non‑positive cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0), which together suggest multiple responsibilities or bulky data/logic bundled in one unit. These factors indicate insufficient modularization and that the class could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
