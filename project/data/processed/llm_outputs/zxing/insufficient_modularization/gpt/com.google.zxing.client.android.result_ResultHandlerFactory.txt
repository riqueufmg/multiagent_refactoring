    "detection": true,
    "justification": "WMC=13 while LOC=27 and NOM=3 (NOPM=1) indicates high cyclomatic complexity concentrated in very few methods (likely a single large factory method). The class depends on many types (Result, ResultParser, ParsedResult, ResultHandler, CaptureActivity), implying it performs multiple creation/decision responsibilities. These signs (high complexity per size, few public methods doing heavy branching, multiple external dependencies) point to Insufficient Modularization and suggest decomposing the factory logic into smaller, focused units (e.g., per-result-type handlers or a strategy/registry)."
