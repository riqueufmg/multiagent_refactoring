    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.QRCodeReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation size and complexity concentrated in few methods: LOC=137 with only NOM=6 (NOPM=3) implies large methods/blocks; WMC=28 indicates high overall cyclomatic complexity and risk of multiple responsibilities. Moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.333) does not rule out remaining internal complexity. The class depends on many external types (Decoder, BitMatrix, DetectorResult, BinaryBitmap, Result, ResultPoint, DecoderResult, NotFoundException, DecodeHintType, ResultMetadataType, BarcodeFormat) indicating it coordinates diverse functionality. Together these metrics suggest the class is not sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
