    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=30, number of fields=3, number of methods=5, WMC=5 (low complexity). LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, only one listed dependency). DIT=1 and nc=0 show shallow inheritance and no subclasses. These metrics do not indicate an insufficiently modular (overly large or complex) class that needs further decomposition."
