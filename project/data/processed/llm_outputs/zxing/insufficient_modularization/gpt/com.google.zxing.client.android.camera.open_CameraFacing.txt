    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no behavior or internal complexity (loc=4, nom=0, wmc=0, nc=0). Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric indicates no decomposable state (lcom=-1.0). Given these metrics and analyzing the class in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
