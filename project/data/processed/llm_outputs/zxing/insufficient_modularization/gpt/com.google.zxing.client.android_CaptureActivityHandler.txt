    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivityHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation complexity (WMC = 16) combined with relatively small method count (NOM = 4, NOPM = 2) and non-trivial size (LOC = 91) indicates complex logic concentrated in few methods. The class holds state (NOF = 5) and depends on multiple distinct collaborators (CameraManager, DecodeThread, CaptureActivity, Intents and an internal State), suggesting multiple responsibilities. These factors (WMC=16, LOC=91, NOM=4, NOPM=2, NOF=5, multiple external dependencies) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
