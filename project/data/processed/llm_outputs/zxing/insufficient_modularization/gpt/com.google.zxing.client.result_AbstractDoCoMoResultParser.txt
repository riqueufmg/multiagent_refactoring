    "justification": "Class is small and not insufficiently modular: loc=12 (very small), nom=2 (only two methods), wmc=2 (low complexity), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion), nc=4 and dit=1 (shallow inheritance), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling indicators requiring decomposition). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and cohesive, so no Insufficient Modularization detected."
