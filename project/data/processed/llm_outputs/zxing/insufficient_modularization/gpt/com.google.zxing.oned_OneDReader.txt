    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.OneDReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 196 LOC and a WMC of 32 while providing only 8 methods (4 public), indicating large and/or complex methods that could be split. It depends on many distinct types (ResultMetadataType, Result, BitArray, ResultPoint, BinaryBitmap, DecodeHintType, NotFoundException), suggesting multiple responsibilities. DIT = 0 (no inheritance-based decomposition) and LCOM = -1.0 (not indicating strong cohesion) further support that the class is not well modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
