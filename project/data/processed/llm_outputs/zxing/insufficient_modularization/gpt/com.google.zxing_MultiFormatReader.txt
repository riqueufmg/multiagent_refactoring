    "class": "com.google.zxing.MultiFormatReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=126 (moderately large), WMC=26 (high aggregate complexity suggesting many or complex responsibilities), nom=6 with nopm=5 (a compact but non-trivial public API), and nof=3 (state held). It directly depends on six external types (Result, BarcodeFormat, Reader, BinaryBitmap, DecodeHintType, NotFoundException), indicating it coordinates multiple concerns. DIT=1 and NC=0 show no further decomposition via inheritance, and fanin/fanout are 0 (no isolating interactions in the provided data). Although LCOM=0.0 (cohesion metric) does not indicate fragmentation of methods, the combination of high WMC, moderate size, and multiple external dependencies supports that the class likely aggregates multiple responsibilities and could be further decomposed to reduce complexity and improve modularity."
