    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=62, nom=4, nof=4 and LCOM=0.0 indicate a compact, cohesive unit rather than a large undivided class. Complexity is moderate (WMC=12) but not extreme given the low method and line counts. External dependencies (BitMatrix, BitMatrixParser, ReedSolomonDecoder, DecodedBitStreamParser, DecoderResult, FormatException, ChecksumException, GenericGF) are all directly related to decoding responsibilities, suggesting collaboration with focused helper classes rather than unrelated responsibilities piled into one class. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 (no excessive coupling within the measured scope) further support that the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
