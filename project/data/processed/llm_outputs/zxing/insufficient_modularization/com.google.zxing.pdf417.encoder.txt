High cognitive load and many responsibilities (handles multiple encoding modes, ECI handling, interacts with Compaction and other encoder helpers). Metrics and role indicate this class is doing too much and should be decomposed."

Acts as an orchestrator with a bloated interface and mixed responsibilities — candidate for splitting into smaller cohesive classes."
