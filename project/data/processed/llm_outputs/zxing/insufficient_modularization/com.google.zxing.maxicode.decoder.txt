Although LCOM=0.2 shows some cohesion, the class appears bloated and a likely candidate to be decomposed into smaller parser/helper classes to reduce complexity."

Dependencies show it delegates to BitMatrixParser and DecodedBitStreamParser and to reed-solomon utilities, indicating responsibilities are distributed rather than concentrated."
