    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics (WMC=61, LOC=238, NOM=19) indicating significant implementation complexity, and it depends on multiple domain-specific classes (Codeword, BarcodeMetadata, DetectionResultColumn, BoundingBox, PDF417Common), suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules to reduce size and complexity."
