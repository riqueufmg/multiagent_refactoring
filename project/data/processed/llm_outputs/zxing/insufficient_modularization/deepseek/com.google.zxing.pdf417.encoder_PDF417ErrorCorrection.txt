    "justification": "The class has 4 methods (nom=4) and a relatively high weighted method count (wmc=14) with 77 lines of code (loc=77), indicating significant implementation complexity concentrated in a single class. The lack of fields (nof=1) suggests methods are likely procedural and could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or helper methods to reduce complexity."
