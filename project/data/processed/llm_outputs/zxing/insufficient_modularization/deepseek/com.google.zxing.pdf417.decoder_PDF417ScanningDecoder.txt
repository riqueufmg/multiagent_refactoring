    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (455) and WMC (108) are very high, indicating a large and complex class. It has 25 methods (nom) with only 2 being public (nopm), suggesting many internal methods that could be extracted into separate helper classes. The low LCOM (0.16) suggests high cohesion, but the excessive size and method count still indicate insufficient decomposition."
