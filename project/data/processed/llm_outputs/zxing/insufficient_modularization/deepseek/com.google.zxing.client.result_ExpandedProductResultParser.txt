    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high WMC (49) and LOC (111) with only 3 methods, indicating complex methods that could be decomposed. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests poor cohesion, and the class has only 1 public method, suggesting it may be taking on too much responsibility within its limited method count."
