    "justification": "The class has 4 methods with only 1 public method, indicating potential grouping of responsibilities. With 69 LOC and WMC of 11, the complexity suggests multiple concerns could be separated. The presence of 6 external dependencies shows the class interacts with multiple components, which could be better encapsulated through further decomposition."
