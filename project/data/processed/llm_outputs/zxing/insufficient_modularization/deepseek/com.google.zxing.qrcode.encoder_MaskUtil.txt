    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 9 methods (nom=9) and 161 lines of code (loc=161) with a weighted method complexity of 38 (wmc=38), indicating high implementation complexity and size that could be reduced through further decomposition. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and absence of public fields (nopf=0) or methods (nopm=0) suggest it is a utility class that could be split into more focused helper classes."
