    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivityHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 4 methods with 2 public methods, 5 fields, 91 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 16. This indicates moderate size and complexity concentrated in one class. The class handles multiple responsibilities including decoding thread management, camera management, and activity coordination, suggesting insufficient decomposition into specialized classes."
