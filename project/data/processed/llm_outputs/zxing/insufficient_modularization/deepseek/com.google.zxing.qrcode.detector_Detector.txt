    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.Detector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 14 methods (nom=14) and 37 weighted methods per class (wmc=37) in 238 lines of code (loc=238), indicating insufficient decomposition. The low number of public methods (nopm=3) relative to total methods suggests many internal helper methods that could be extracted into separate classes."
