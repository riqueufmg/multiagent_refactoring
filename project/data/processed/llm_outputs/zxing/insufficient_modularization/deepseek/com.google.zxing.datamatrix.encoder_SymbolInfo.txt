    "justification": "Class has high complexity with 21 methods (17 public), 123 lines of code, and weighted method complexity of 38. The low LCOM value (0.19) indicates high cohesion, but the large number of methods and overall size suggests insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
