    "justification": "Class has only 1 method (nom=1) and 19 lines of code (loc=19), which is small and focused. Weighted method complexity (wmc=3) is low, indicating simple implementation. No fields (nof=0) suggest minimal state management. The class appears to have a single responsibility and does not show signs of needing further decomposition."
