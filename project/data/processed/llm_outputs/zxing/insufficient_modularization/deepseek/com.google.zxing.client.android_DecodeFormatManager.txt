    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeFormatManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 fields (nof=9) and 4 methods (nom=4) with a weighted method complexity of 9 (wmc=9) and 60 lines of code (loc=60), indicating moderate size and complexity concentrated in a single class. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and absence of parent/child relationships suggests it is a standalone utility class that could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or modules to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
