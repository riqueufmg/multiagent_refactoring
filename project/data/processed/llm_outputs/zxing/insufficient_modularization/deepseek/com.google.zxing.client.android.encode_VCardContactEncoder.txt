```json
{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.VCardContactEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 5 methods with only 1 being public, indicating most logic is internal. With 81 LOC and WMC of 27, the class has moderate size and complexity concentrated in few methods. The LCOM of 0.0 suggests high method cohesion, but the presence of only 1 field suggests the class may be handling multiple responsibilities through its methods rather than through decomposed state. The lack of inheritance (DIT=1) and dependencies on only formatter utilities further suggests the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units."
