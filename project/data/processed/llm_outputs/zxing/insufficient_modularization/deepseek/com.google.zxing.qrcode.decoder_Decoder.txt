    "justification": "Class has moderate size (114 LOC, 7 methods) with low complexity (WMC=13) and good cohesion (LCOM=0.29). It shows appropriate modularization through delegation to specialized classes (BitMatrixParser, DataBlock, ReedSolomonDecoder, DecodedBitStreamParser) rather than implementing all functionality internally."
