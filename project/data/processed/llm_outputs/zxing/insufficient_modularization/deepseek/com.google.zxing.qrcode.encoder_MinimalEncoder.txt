    "justification": "High LOC (382) and WMC (46) indicate large size and complexity. High number of methods (nom=13) and fields (nof=17) suggest multiple responsibilities. The presence of inner classes (Edge, VersionSize, ResultList) as dependencies hints at internal structures that could be separate classes, supporting insufficient decomposition."
