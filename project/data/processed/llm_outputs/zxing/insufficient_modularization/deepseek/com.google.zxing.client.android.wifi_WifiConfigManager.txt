    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High WMC (47) and LOC (224) indicate significant complexity. Low LCOM (0.21) suggests cohesive methods, but 14 methods with only 3 fields suggests insufficient decomposition of responsibilities. The class handles multiple concerns (parsing, configuration, network types) that could be separated."
