    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has only one field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), with minimal functionality (loc=8, wmc=0). This suggests it is a simple data holder that could potentially be decomposed or integrated into its parent class to reduce complexity and improve modularization."
