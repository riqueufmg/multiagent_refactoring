    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (320) and WMC (65) are high, indicating a large and complex class. It has 15 methods with only 6 being public, suggesting many internal helper methods that could be extracted. The LCOM value (0.4) indicates moderate cohesion, which could be improved through further decomposition."
