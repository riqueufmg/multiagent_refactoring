    "justification": "The class has moderate size (115 LOC, 11 methods) with low complexity (WMC=15, LCOM=0.18). It has 8 public methods suggesting a focused interface, and dependencies are minimal (only FormatException and its own inner class ECBlocks). No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity significantly."
