    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC=266, WMC=57, and NOM=15. It also has 9 fields and depends on 10 external types, indicating it may be handling multiple responsibilities such as encoding logic, contact processing, and result parsing that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
