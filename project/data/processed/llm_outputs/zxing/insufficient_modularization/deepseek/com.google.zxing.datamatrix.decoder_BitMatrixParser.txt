    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (372) and WMC (71) are significantly large, indicating substantial implementation complexity. With 11 methods and no decomposition into smaller classes, it exhibits insufficient modularization despite low LCOM and no dependencies beyond basic types."
