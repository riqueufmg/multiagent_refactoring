    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods with 7 public methods, 184 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 36, indicating significant implementation complexity that could be reduced through decomposition. The low LCOM value (0.15) suggests high method cohesion, but the overall size and complexity metrics exceed typical single-responsibility thresholds."
