    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MatrixUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 20 methods (nom=20) and 226 lines of code (loc=226), indicating high implementation complexity and size. The low LCOM value (0.1) suggests high method cohesion, but the large number of methods and lines of code in a single class with no parent (dit=0) and no outgoing dependencies (fanout=0) suggests it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce complexity and improve modularity."
