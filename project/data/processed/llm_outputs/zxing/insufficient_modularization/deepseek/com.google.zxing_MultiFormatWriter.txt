    "class": "com.google.zxing.MultiFormatWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) but high complexity (wmc=15) and moderate size (loc=42), indicating that its methods likely handle multiple responsibilities internally. The lack of decomposition is evident from the absence of helper methods (nopm=2 equals nom=2) and the high weighted method count relative to the number of methods suggests insufficient modularization of internal logic."
