    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open.OpenCameraInterface",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 2 fields (nof=2) but shows high cohesion issues (lcom=1.0) and moderate complexity (wmc=9). The high LCOM indicates methods operate on disjoint sets of fields, suggesting the class handles multiple responsibilities that could be separated. The class depends on two other camera-related types, indicating it might be managing both camera opening logic and camera configuration/state, which could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
