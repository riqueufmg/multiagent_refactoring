    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics (WMC=49, LOC=220, NOM=12) indicating it may be performing multiple responsibilities. The low LCOM (0.0) suggests high method cohesion, but the size and complexity exceed typical modularization thresholds, suggesting further decomposition could reduce implementation complexity."
