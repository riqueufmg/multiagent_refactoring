    "justification": "Class has only 3 methods (nom=3), 30 lines of code (loc=30), and 3 weighted methods (wmc=3), indicating minimal implementation complexity. No fields (nof=0) and no public fields (nopf=0) suggest simple interface. Dependencies are all external types, not internal responsibilities. Size and complexity are insufficient to justify further decomposition."
