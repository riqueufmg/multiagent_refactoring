    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 17 fields (nof=17) and 19 methods (nom=19) with 113 lines of code (loc=113), indicating high complexity and size that could be reduced through decomposition. The lack of child classes (nc=0) and low cohesion (lcom=0.0) suggest insufficient modularization despite the class performing multiple responsibilities."
