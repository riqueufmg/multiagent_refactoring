    "justification": "The class has moderate size (98 LOC, 9 methods) with low complexity (WMC=18, NC=6) and good cohesion (LCOM=0.33). All methods are public (NOPM=5) with no private methods, suggesting it's already a focused interface. No evidence of multiple responsibilities or high implementation complexity requiring further decomposition."
