    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has low complexity (WMC=3, LOC=24), minimal methods (NOM=2), and no fields (NOF=2 but NOPF=0 indicates no public fields, suggesting minimal state). LCOM=1.0 indicates all methods operate on disjoint sets, but with only 2 methods this doesn't indicate significant lack of cohesion. The class appears appropriately sized for its purpose."
