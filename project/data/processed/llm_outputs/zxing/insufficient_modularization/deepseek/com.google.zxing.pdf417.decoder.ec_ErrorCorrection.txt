    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 5 methods with 2 public methods, 129 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 23. This indicates a moderate size and complexity that could potentially be reduced through further decomposition, such as extracting helper methods for specific error correction calculations or state management."
