    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.MECARDContactEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: only 1 method (nom=1), 41 lines of code (loc=41), and weighted method complexity of 1 (wmc=1). It has 5 fields (nof=5) but no public fields (nopf=0). The lack of methods and low overall size indicates the class is already sufficiently modularized for its purpose."
