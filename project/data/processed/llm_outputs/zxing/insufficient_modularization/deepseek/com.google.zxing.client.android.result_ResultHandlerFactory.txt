    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: LOC=27, WMC=13, NOM=3, NOPM=1. It has no fields (NOF=0) and minimal method count. The LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. The class appears to be a simple factory with a single public method and minimal implementation complexity, showing sufficient modularization for its purpose."
