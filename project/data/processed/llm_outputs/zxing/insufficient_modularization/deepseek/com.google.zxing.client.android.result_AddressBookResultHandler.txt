    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=26, LOC=126), moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.375), and minimal dependencies. It shows no signs of insufficient modularization as it has a focused responsibility with 8 methods (6 public) and 4 fields, suggesting appropriate decomposition for its purpose."
