    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.ChartServlet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 4 methods (nom=4) and 115 lines of code (loc=115) with a weighted method complexity of 15 (wmc=15), indicating multiple responsibilities. It depends on 6 external classes for chart generation and request handling, suggesting it combines HTTP request processing, parameter extraction, and barcode image generation in a single class without decomposition."
