{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.LRUMap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: only 2 methods (nom=2), 15 lines of code (loc=15), and low weighted method count (wmc=2). It has no fields (nof=1 includes the class itself, but nopf=0 indicates no public fields), no dependencies, and perfect cohesion (lcom=0.0). These characteristics indicate the class is already sufficiently modularized with minimal size and complexity."
