```json
{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.share.LoadPackagesAsyncTask",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 5 methods (nom=5) with a weighted method complexity of 15 (wmc=15) and 59 lines of code (loc=59), indicating moderate implementation complexity. The lack of fields (nof=3, nopf=0) suggests it primarily handles a single responsibility, but the method count and complexity could be reduced by decomposing the AsyncTask logic into smaller, more focused helper methods or classes."
