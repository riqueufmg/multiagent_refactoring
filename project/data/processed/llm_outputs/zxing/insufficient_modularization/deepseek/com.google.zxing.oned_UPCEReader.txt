    "justification": "The class has 7 methods with only 2 being public, indicating potential grouping of responsibilities. The LCOM value of 0.57 suggests moderate cohesion, and the WMC of 19 shows moderate complexity that could be reduced through decomposition. The presence of 3 fields with mixed method interactions may indicate insufficient separation of concerns."
