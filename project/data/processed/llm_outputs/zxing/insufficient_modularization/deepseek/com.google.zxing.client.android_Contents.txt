    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.Contents",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 fields (nof=12, nopf=12) but only 1 method (nom=1) and 0 public methods (nopm=0), indicating it primarily holds data without significant behavior. The low method count (nom=1) and low weighted method complexity (wmc=1) relative to the high field count suggest insufficient decomposition of responsibilities. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) further supports that this is a data container that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or structures."
