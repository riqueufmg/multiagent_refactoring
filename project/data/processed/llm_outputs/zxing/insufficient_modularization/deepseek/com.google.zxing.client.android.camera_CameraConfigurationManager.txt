{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraConfigurationManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) and 8 fields (nof=8) with 156 lines of code (loc=156) and weighted method complexity of 30 (wmc=30), indicating substantial implementation complexity. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.167) suggests the class handles multiple responsibilities that are related, but the size and complexity metrics show it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its implementation complexity."
