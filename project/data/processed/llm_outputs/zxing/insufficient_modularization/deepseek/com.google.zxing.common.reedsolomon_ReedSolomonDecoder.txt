    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.ReedSolomonDecoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods with 3 public methods, 137 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 25. This indicates a significant implementation complexity concentrated in a single class. The lack of decomposition is evident from the high LOC and WMC metrics, suggesting the class handles multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
