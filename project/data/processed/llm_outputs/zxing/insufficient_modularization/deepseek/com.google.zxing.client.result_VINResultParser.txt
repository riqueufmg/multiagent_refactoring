    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.VINResultParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High WMC (54) and LOC (153) indicate significant complexity. The class has 7 methods with only 1 being public, suggesting internal helper methods that could be extracted. Low LCOM (0.0) shows high method cohesion, but the size metrics suggest insufficient decomposition of parsing logic."
