{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (442) and WMC (89) are very high, indicating a large and complex class. It has 31 methods (nom) with only 2 non-public methods (nom - nopm), suggesting many public methods and potential lack of internal decomposition. The low LCOM (0.0645) indicates high method cohesion, but the overall size and complexity suggest the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or helper components."
