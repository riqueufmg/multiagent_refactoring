    "justification": "Class has high metrics indicating insufficient decomposition: 21 methods (nom=21), 41 weighted methods per class (wmc=41), 235 lines of code (loc=235), and 14 fields (nof=14). These values suggest the class is large and complex, handling multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
