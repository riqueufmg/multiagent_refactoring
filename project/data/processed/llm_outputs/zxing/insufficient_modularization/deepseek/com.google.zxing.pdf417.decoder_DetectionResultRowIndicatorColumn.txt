    "justification": "Class has high complexity (WMC=45, LOC=190) with 9 methods, suggesting insufficient decomposition. Low cohesion (LCOM=0.0) indicates unrelated methods grouped together. Single public method (nopm=1) suggests the class handles multiple responsibilities internally rather than delegating to specialized classes."
