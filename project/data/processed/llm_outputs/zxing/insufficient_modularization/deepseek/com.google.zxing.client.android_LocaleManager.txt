    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.LocaleManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 10 methods with 4 public methods, 7 fields, 134 lines of code, and weighted method complexity of 13. The LCOM value of 0.4 indicates moderate cohesion, suggesting some methods could be grouped into separate helper classes. The class handles locale management but has multiple responsibilities including preference handling and locale-specific logic, which could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
