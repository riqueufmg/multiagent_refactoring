    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=11, LOC=74), high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), and minimal dependencies. It has only 4 fields and 7 methods, with 6 being public methods that likely represent a focused, single-responsibility interface. No clear indicators of insufficient decomposition exist."
