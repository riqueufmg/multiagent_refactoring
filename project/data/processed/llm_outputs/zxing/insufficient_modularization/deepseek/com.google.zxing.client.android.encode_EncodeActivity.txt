{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.EncodeActivity",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods with 3 public methods, 5 fields, and 159 lines of code. The LCOM value of 0.2857 indicates moderate cohesion, suggesting responsibilities could be better separated. The class directly depends on three external classes for encoding and intent handling, which could be encapsulated into separate helper or service classes to reduce its size and complexity."
