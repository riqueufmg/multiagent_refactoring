    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.PDF417",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high complexity with 14 methods (9 public), 234 lines of code, and 31 weighted methods per class. It depends on 5 external encoder classes, suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules handling specific aspects of PDF417 encoding."
