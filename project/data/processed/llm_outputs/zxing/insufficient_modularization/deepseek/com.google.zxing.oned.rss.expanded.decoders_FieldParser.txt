    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 244 lines of code (LOC) and a weighted method complexity (WMC) of 18, indicating significant size and complexity. With 6 fields and 4 methods, it shows moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.5), but the high LOC and WMC suggest insufficient decomposition. The class handles multiple responsibilities internally without leveraging further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
