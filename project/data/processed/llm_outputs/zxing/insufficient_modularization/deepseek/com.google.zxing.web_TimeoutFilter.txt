    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.TimeoutFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=7, LOC=43, NOM=4) with no fields indicating state (NOF=3, NOPF=0), all methods are public (NOPM=4), and it has no dependencies. The LCOM value (0.5) suggests moderate cohesion, but the overall size and complexity do not indicate a clear need for further decomposition."
