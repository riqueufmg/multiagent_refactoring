    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 1 public method (nopm=1), low complexity (wmc=8), and minimal size (loc=52). LCOM=1.0 indicates all methods operate on different fields, but with only 1 field (nof=1) this is expected. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
