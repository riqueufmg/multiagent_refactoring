    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.ECIEncoderSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 110 lines of code (loc=110) and a weighted method complexity of 21 (wmc=21), indicating significant implementation complexity. All methods are public (nopm=9), suggesting multiple responsibilities. The class has 0 fields (nof=3 includes inherited, but nopf=0 indicates no private fields), yet high method count and complexity suggest insufficient decomposition into smaller, focused classes."
