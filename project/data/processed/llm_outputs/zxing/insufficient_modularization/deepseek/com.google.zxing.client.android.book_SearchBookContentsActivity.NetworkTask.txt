    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.book.SearchBookContentsActivity.NetworkTask",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 94 lines of code (loc) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it likely contains inline implementation that could be decomposed into separate methods to reduce size and complexity. The lack of methods suggests insufficient modularization within the class."
