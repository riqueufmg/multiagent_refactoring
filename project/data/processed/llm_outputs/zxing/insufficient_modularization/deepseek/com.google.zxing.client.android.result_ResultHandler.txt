    "justification": "Class has high complexity metrics: LOC (361), WMC (80), and number of methods (43) are very high, indicating insufficient decomposition. Low LCOM (0.186) suggests high method cohesion, but the large size and complexity show the class is handling too many responsibilities and should be split into smaller, more focused modules."
