    "justification": "The class has 6 methods with only 1 being public, indicating multiple private methods that could be extracted. The WMC of 26 suggests high cyclomatic complexity, and the LCOM of -1.0 indicates poor cohesion. The class depends on DecoderConfig and DecodeWorker, suggesting it handles both configuration and decoding logic that could be separated."
