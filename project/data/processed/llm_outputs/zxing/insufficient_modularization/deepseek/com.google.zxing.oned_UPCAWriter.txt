    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.UPCAWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 16 lines of code (loc=16), but it depends on EAN13Writer, suggesting it delegates core functionality. This indicates the class could be further decomposed or merged, as its minimal implementation complexity and size suggest insufficient modularization."
