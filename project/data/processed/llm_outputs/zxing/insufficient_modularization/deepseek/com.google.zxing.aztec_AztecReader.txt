    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 75 LOC and WMC=11, indicating small size and low complexity. All methods are public (nopm=3), suggesting a focused interface. No fields (nof=0) and no child classes (nc=0) further indicate minimal internal state and simple responsibility. The dependencies are all external types required for decoding functionality, not indicators of insufficient modularization."
