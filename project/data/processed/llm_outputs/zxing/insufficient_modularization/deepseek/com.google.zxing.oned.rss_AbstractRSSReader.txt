    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.AbstractRSSReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 10 fields and 12 methods with 104 lines of code and weighted method complexity of 22, indicating substantial size and implementation complexity that could benefit from decomposition. The lack of inheritance (DIT=0) and absence of parent/child relationships suggest it's a standalone class that hasn't been sufficiently modularized."
