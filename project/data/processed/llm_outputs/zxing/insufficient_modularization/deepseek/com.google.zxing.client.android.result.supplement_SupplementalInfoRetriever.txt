    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement.SupplementalInfoRetriever",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with 6 fields (nof=6) and 121 lines of code (loc=121), indicating substantial size and complexity. The weighted methods per class (wmc=25) is high, and the lack of cohesion metric (lcom=0.625) suggests multiple responsibilities. The class depends on 7 external types, handling multiple result types (Product, URI, Book, Title), which could be decomposed into separate specialized retrievers."
