    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.DecoderResult",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 fields and 20 methods, indicating high complexity and potential for further decomposition. The low LCOM value (0.2) suggests high cohesion, but the large number of fields and methods (WMC=20) combined with zero dependencies suggests the class may be handling multiple responsibilities internally without delegating to other classes."
