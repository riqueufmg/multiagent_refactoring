    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.DataMatrixWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 4 methods (nom=4) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), a high WMC (25) indicating complex methods, and a high LOC (138). The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests high method cohesion, but the size and complexity metrics indicate the class is handling multiple responsibilities (e.g., encoding, matrix generation, error correction) that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
