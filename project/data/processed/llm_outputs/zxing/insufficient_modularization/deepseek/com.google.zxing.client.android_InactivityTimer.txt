    "justification": "The class has 6 fields and 6 methods with 82 LOC and WMC of 9, indicating moderate size and complexity. It contains two inner classes (PowerStatusReceiver and InactivityAsyncTask) that handle distinct responsibilities (power monitoring and async task execution), suggesting these could be decomposed into separate classes to reduce implementation complexity and improve single responsibility."
