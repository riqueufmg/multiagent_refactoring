    "justification": "Class has high complexity (WMC=61, LOC=284) with 11 methods and 10 fields, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The single public method indicates most logic is internal, and low cohesion (LCOM=0.0) may result from grouped unrelated functionalities. Further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
