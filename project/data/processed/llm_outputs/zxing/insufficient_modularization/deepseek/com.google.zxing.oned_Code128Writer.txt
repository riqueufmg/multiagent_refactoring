    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High LOC (405) and WMC (65) indicate large size and complexity. High number of fields (21) and methods (8) suggest multiple responsibilities. Low cohesion (LCOM 0.25) implies unrelated functionality grouped together. The class contains inner classes (CType, Latch, Charset) that could be separate, and high fanout (0) suggests it handles all logic internally rather than delegating."
