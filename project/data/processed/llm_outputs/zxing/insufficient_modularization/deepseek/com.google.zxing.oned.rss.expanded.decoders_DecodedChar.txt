    "justification": "Class has only 2 fields and 3 methods with 18 LOC and 3 WMC, indicating minimal size and complexity. LCOM of 0.0 suggests high cohesion. No dependencies indicate it is already a focused, single-responsibility unit. Further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
