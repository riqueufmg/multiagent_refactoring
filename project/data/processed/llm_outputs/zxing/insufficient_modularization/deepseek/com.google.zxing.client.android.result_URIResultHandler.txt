    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=14, LOC=50, NOM=7) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.857, all methods are public). It has no fields of its own (NOF=2 includes inherited fields). The class is already focused on handling URI results, with no indication of multiple responsibilities or high internal complexity requiring further decomposition."
