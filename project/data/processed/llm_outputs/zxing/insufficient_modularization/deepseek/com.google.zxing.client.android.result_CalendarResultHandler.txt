    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.CalendarResultHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with 6 being public (nopm=6) and a relatively high LCOM value of 0.625, indicating low cohesion. With 104 lines of code (loc=104) and 18 weighted methods per class (wmc=18), the class exhibits implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition into more focused, cohesive units."
