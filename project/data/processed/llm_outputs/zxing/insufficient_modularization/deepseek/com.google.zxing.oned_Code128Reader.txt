    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High WMC (79) and LOC (326) indicate significant implementation complexity. Low number of methods (nom=3) relative to high WMC suggests methods are large and complex. LCOM=0.0 shows all methods use all fields, potentially indicating insufficient separation of concerns. These metrics suggest the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units."
