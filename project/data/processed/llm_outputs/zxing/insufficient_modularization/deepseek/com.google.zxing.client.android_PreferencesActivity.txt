    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: LOC=35, WMC=1, NOF=24 (all public), NOM=1. It shows no signs of high implementation complexity or large size that would require further decomposition. The single method and low WMC indicate minimal logic, while 24 public fields suggest it may be a simple data/configuration class rather than one with insufficient modularization."
