    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Common",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 10 fields (8 public) but only 4 methods (3 public), indicating a high number of fields relative to methods. The LCOM value of 1.0 suggests poor cohesion, as fields are not being used together by methods. The class has 0 incoming and outgoing dependencies, showing it is isolated and could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more focused utility classes."
