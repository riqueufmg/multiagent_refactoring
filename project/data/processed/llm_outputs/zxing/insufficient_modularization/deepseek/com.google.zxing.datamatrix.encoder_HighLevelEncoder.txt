    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.HighLevelEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high complexity metrics: 21 methods (nom=21), 371 lines of code (loc=371), and weighted method complexity of 73 (wmc=73). The class depends on multiple encoder classes (C40Encoder, Encoder, EncoderContext) suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules handling specific encoding responsibilities."
