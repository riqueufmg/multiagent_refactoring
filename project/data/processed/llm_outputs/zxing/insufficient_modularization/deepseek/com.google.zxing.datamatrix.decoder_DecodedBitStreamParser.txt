    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High LOC (432) and WMC (103) indicate large size and complexity. The class has 11 methods but only 5 fields, suggesting multiple responsibilities concentrated in methods. Low LCOM (0.18) shows high method cohesion on shared fields, but the overall metrics suggest the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or helper methods to reduce size and complexity."
