    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=14, LOC=78), moderate number of methods (NOM=7) with 2 public methods, and no indication of high implementation complexity or large size that would require further decomposition. LCOM=0 suggests good cohesion, and it has minimal dependencies."
