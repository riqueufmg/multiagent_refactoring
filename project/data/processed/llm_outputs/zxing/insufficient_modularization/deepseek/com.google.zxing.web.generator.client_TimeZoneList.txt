    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=11, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=3) and no internal coupling issues (LCOM=0.0). It depends only on TimeZoneInfo, suggesting it is already a focused, single-responsibility class. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
