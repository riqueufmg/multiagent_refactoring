    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.MatrixToImageWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 111 lines of code (loc=111) and moderate complexity (wmc=13). All methods are public (nopm=8 out of nom=9), indicating it handles multiple responsibilities like matrix conversion, buffered image creation, and file writing operations. The lack of decomposition is evident from the single class file (nof=1) containing all functionality despite multiple dependencies on BitMatrix, BitArray, and MatrixToImageConfig."
