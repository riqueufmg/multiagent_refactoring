    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=15, LOC=65, NOM=3) and no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0), indicating it is already small and focused. LCOM=0.0 suggests good cohesion, and it has no fan-in or fan-out dependencies beyond its inheritance and required types, showing no clear need for further decomposition."
