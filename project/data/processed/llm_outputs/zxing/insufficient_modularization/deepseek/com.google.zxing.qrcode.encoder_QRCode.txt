    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.QRCode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=14, LOC=72), minimal fields (NOF=6), and no indication of excessive responsibilities. All methods are public (NOPM=13, NOM=13), suggesting it's a focused data container. LCOM=0 indicates good cohesion, and it has no fan-in/fan-out dependencies beyond its domain types."
