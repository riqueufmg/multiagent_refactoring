    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and a weighted method complexity of 28 (wmc=28), indicating significant implementation complexity. With 130 lines of code (loc=130) and only 6 fields (nof=6), the class appears to handle multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
