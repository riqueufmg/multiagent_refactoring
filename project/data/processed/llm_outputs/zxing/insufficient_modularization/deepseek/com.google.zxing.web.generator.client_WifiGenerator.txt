    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.WifiGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and a weighted method complexity of 28 (wmc=28), indicating a high number of methods and moderate complexity concentrated in a single class. With 5 fields (nof=5) and low cohesion (lcom=0.14), it suggests the class handles multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
