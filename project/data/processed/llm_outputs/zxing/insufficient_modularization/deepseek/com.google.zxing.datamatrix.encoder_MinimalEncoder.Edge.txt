    "justification": "The class has 9 fields (nof=9) and 338 lines of code (loc=338), indicating high size and potential complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) suggests all behavior is implemented elsewhere, making this a data structure that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
