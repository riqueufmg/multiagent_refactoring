    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.detector.Detector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics (WMC=32, LOC=249, NOM=11) indicating significant implementation complexity. It has only 2 fields (NOF=2) but many methods, suggesting multiple responsibilities are concentrated in a single class. The low LCOM (0.0) suggests high method cohesion, but the overall size and complexity indicate insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
