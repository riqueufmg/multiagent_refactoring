{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High WMC (61) and LOC (261) indicate significant complexity. The class has 9 methods but only 2 fields, suggesting procedural grouping rather than cohesive object design. Low LCOM (0.22) shows high method cohesion on few fields, but the overall size and complexity suggest the class handles multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, focused modules."
