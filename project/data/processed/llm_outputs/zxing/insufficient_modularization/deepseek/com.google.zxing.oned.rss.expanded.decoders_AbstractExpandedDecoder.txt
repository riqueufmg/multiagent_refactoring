    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=19, LOC=49, NOM=5) with moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.4) and minimal fields (NOF=2). It shows no signs of insufficient decomposition as it has only 2 direct dependencies and serves as an abstract base with 2 public methods, indicating appropriate modularization for its purpose."
