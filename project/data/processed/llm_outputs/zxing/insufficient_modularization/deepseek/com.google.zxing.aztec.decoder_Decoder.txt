{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder.Decoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high complexity metrics: LOC (319) and WMC (61) are high, indicating large size and many decision points. It has 11 methods with only 2 public methods, suggesting many private helper methods that could be extracted. The class has 0 dependencies on other classes in the same package but depends on 9 external types, showing it handles multiple responsibilities like decoding, error correction, and bit manipulation that could be modularized."
