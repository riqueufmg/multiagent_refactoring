    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.GeoLocationGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods with 6 public methods, 6 fields, and 93 lines of code, indicating moderate size and complexity. The LCOM value of 0.22 suggests some cohesion issues, and the WMC of 20 shows moderate method complexity. The class could potentially be decomposed to separate concerns like field management, validation logic, or UI generation into smaller, more focused classes."
