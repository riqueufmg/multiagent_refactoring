    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code39Writer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 4 methods (nom=4) with a high weighted method count (wmc=26) and moderate lines of code (loc=104), indicating multiple responsibilities concentrated in one class. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) suggests it is purely procedural, and the negative LCOM (lcom=-1.0) confirms all methods share no common state, which are signs of insufficient modularization where decomposition into smaller, focused classes could reduce complexity."
