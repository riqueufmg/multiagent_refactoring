{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.GridSampler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 5 methods with 17 WMC and 107 LOC, indicating moderate size and complexity. The LCOM of 0.8 suggests low cohesion, and the class has only 1 field, which may indicate methods are not operating on shared state effectively. The presence of 4 public methods suggests multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
