    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.AutoFocusManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 fields and 6 methods with 85 lines of code, indicating potential for further decomposition. The presence of an inner class AutoFocusTask suggests related functionality that could be separated, and the high field count relative to methods suggests insufficient modularization of responsibilities."
