{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.PlanarYUVLuminanceSource",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 8 public methods (nopm=8), 6 fields (nof=6), 103 lines of code (loc=103), and weighted methods complexity of 20 (wmc=20). The size and complexity metrics suggest the class handles multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce implementation complexity."
