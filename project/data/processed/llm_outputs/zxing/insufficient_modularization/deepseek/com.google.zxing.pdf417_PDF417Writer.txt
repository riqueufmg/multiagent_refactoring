    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 5 methods with 2 public methods, 106 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 21. This indicates multiple responsibilities concentrated in one class, suggesting insufficient decomposition that could reduce size and complexity through modularization."
