    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.ViewfinderResultPointCallback",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 2 methods, 9 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 2. It has a single responsibility of implementing a callback interface and delegates functionality to ViewfinderView. The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates high cohesion, and the class is already appropriately decomposed for its purpose."
