It depends on and coordinates multiple specialized retrievers and UI/activity classes (TitleRetriever, ProductResultInfoRetriever, BookResultInfoRetriever, URIResultInfoRetriever, CaptureActivity, HistoryManager), indicating it consolidates orchestration and multiple responsibilities rather than delegating them cleanly. Relative to other small, focused retrievers in the package, this class appears bloated and insufficiently decomposed."
