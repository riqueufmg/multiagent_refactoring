It depends on many concepts (BitMatrix, ResultPointCallback, Detector, FinderPattern, FinderPatternInfo, decoding hints) and even contains a nested comparator class, indicating multiple responsibilities (scanning, pattern validation, sorting, heuristics) concentrated in one class. The size and complexity make it hard to understand and suggest it should be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive components."
