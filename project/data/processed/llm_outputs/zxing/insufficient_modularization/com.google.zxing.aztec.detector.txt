It depends on many unrelated modules (reedsolomon, common.detector.MathUtils, GridSampler, BitMatrix, AztecReader, etc.), and defines nested helper classes (Point, CorrectedParameter), indicating multiple responsibilities concentrated in one abstraction. These factors indicate inadequate decomposition and a bloated abstraction."
