There is no inheritance depth (dit=0) or subclasses (nc=0) and the class appears to delegate decoding work to com.google.zxing.maxicode.decoder.Decoder, indicating a single responsibility rather than a bloated, monolithic abstraction. Overall metrics do not indicate excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface."
