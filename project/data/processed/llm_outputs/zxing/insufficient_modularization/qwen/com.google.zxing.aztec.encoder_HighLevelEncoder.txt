    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.HighLevelEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization based on high complexity metrics: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 33 which is high, indicating complex internal logic that could benefit from decomposition. The class has 9 methods with only 4 being public, suggesting internal complexity that might be better organized into smaller, more focused classes. The LCOM value of 0.222 suggests some cohesion issues, and with 180 lines of code and 11 fields, the class is large enough that further decomposition could improve maintainability and reduce complexity."
