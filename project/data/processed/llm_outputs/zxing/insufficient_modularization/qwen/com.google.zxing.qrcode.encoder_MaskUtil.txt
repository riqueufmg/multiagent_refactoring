{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MaskUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 38 and 9 methods, suggesting it could be decomposed further. The LCOM value of 0.6666666666666666 indicates poor cohesion, meaning the methods and attributes are not closely related to each other. With 161 lines of code and multiple methods, the class implements significant functionality that could potentially be better organized into smaller, more focused modules."
