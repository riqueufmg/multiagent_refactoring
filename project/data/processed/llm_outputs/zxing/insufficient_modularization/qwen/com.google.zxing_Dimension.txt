    "class": "com.google.zxing.Dimension",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 33 lines of code (loc=33), which indicates a small and manageable size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=8), suggesting low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to be well-focused and adequately modularized for its simple purpose of representing dimensional data."
