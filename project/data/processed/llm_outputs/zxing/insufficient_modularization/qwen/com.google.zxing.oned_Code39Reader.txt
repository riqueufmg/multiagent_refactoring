    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 52 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 254 indicating a large class, and it has 8 methods with 4 public methods suggesting high implementation complexity. The class could benefit from decomposition to reduce its size and complexity."
