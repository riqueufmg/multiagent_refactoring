    "justification": "The class has moderate size (38 LOC, 8 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=9). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the low number of fields (3) and methods (8) suggests appropriate modularization. No clear indicators of insufficient decomposition are present."
