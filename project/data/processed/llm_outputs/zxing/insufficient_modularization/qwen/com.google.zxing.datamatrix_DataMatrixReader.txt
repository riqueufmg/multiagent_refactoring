    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.DataMatrixReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 5 methods (3 public) and WMC of 16, which is manageable. The LOC is 95, which is reasonable for a reader class. LCOM of 0.4 indicates good cohesion. The class appears to have appropriate responsibilities for reading DataMatrix codes and managing dependencies is within expected range for this type of functionality."
