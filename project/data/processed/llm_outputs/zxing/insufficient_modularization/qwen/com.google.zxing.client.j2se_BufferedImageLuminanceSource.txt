    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.BufferedImageLuminanceSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) and 107 lines of code (loc=107), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=16) indicates reasonable complexity. With only 4 fields (nof=4) and a low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.333), the class appears to be reasonably cohesive. The absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance (dit=0) suggests a relatively simple, self-contained class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
