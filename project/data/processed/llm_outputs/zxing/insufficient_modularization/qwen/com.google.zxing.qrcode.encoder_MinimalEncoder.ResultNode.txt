    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MinimalEncoder.ResultNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with 79 lines of code. While the LOC is relatively high for the number of fields, the lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) indicate this is likely a simple data holder class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The class does not exhibit high complexity or size that would warrant further modularization."
