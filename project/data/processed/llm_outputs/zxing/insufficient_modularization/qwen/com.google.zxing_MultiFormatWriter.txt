{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.MultiFormatWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 42 lines of code (loc=42), with a moderate weighted method count (wmc=15). The class directly depends on only 3 external classes and has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The depth of inheritance tree is minimal (dit=1) and there are no children classes (nc=0). These metrics indicate a well-focused, small class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
