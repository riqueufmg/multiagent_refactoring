    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.Detector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 37 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 14 which is elevated, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 238 which is substantial. The class also has a high number of dependencies (14 external classes) suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The lack of private fields (NOF=2, NOPF=0) and low cohesion (LCOM=0.0) further indicate that this class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
