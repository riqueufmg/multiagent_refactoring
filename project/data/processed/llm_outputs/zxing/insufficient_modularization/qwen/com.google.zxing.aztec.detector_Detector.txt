    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.detector.Detector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 20 methods (nom=20) and 402 lines of code (loc=402), indicating high size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=48) further confirms high implementation complexity. The class also has 11 fields (nof=11) and 9 dependencies, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. These metrics collectively indicate that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and complexity."
