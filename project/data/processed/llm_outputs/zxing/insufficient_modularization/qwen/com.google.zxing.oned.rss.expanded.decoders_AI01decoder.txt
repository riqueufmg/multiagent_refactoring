    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.AI01decoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 4 methods and WMC of 9, but the LCOM value of 0.5 indicates good cohesion. With only 41 lines of code and 4 methods, the class size is reasonable. The class has a DIT of 1 indicating no inheritance complexity, and zero fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggesting simple coupling. While there might be room for decomposition, the current modularization appears sufficient given the class's size and complexity metrics."
