{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.DetectorResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3) and 2 fields (nof=2), with 18 lines of code (loc=18). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity (wmc=3), indicates the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion among the class members."
