    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.BinaryShiftToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 fields (nof=2), and low weighted method count (wmc=7). The lines of code (loc=30) are minimal, indicating a small and focused class. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1) suggest proper modularization. The class appears to be well-decomposed and focused on a single responsibility."
