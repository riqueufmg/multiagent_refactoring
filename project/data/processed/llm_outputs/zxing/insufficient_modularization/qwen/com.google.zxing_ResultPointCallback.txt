    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=0), 7 lines of code (loc=7), and very low complexity (wmc=1). It represents a simple callback interface with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. The class is already sufficiently modularized for its intended purpose."
