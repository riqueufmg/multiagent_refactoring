    "class": "com.google.zxing.maxicode.MaxiCodeReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (56 LOC) and complexity (WMC=9) with only 4 methods. The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates moderate cohesion which is acceptable. The number of dependencies (9) is manageable and does not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality as a barcode reader."
