    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), 10 lines of code (loc=10), and Weighted Methods per Class of 1 (wmc=1). These metrics indicate a very small and simple class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed given its minimal size and complexity."
