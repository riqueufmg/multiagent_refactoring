{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.GeoResultHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5), 7 weighted method count (wmc=7), and 28 lines of code (loc=28). The lack of fields (nof=1) and low LCOM value (lcom=0.8) suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality, handling geo-related results without excessive complexity that would warrant further modularization."
