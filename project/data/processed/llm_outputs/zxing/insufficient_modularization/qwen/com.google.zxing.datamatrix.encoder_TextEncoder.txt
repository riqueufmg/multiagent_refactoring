    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with low complexity (wmc=12), contains 58 lines of code (loc=58) which is relatively small, has a low depth of inheritance (dit=2), and no fields (nof=0). The low number of methods and manageable complexity metrics indicate sufficient modularization without need for further decomposition."
