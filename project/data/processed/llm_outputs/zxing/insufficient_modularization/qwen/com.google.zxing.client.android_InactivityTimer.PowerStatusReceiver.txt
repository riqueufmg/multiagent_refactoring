    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.InactivityTimer.PowerStatusReceiver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 13 lines of code (loc=13). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. With such low size and complexity, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
