    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.AI013x0x1xDecoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 5 methods and WMC of 10, but LCOM of 0.4 indicates good cohesion. With only 61 lines of code and 3 levels of inheritance depth, the class is reasonably sized and decomposed. The low number of methods and manageable complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
