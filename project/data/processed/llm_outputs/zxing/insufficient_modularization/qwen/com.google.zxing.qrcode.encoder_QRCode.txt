    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.QRCode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13, nopm=13) and 72 lines of code (loc=72), which is within reasonable size limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=14) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low coupling metrics (lcom=0.0) suggest the class is well-focused. While the class has multiple methods, they appear to be cohesive and related to QR code encoding functionality, and there's no clear indication that further decomposition would significantly reduce complexity or improve maintainability."
