{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraConfigurationUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 21 methods (nom), 71 weighted method count (wmc), 344 lines of code (loc), and only 9 fields (nof). The high WMC/Loc ratio suggests complex method implementations, while the high method count relative to fields indicates the class is doing too much work without proper decomposition. LCOM value of 0.238 suggests some cohesion issues. The class contains too many responsibilities for a single unit, warranting further decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
