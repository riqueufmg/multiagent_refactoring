{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.CodaBarReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 48 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 226 indicating a large class size, and it has 8 methods with only 2 being public. The high WMC suggests complex internal method interactions, while the large LOC count indicates the class has not been decomposed into smaller, more manageable units. Despite having a low LCOM value (0.0), the overall size and complexity metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce implementation complexity."
