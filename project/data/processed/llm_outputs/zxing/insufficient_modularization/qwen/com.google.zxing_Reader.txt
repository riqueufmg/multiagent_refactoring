    "class": "com.google.zxing.Reader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 30 lines of code (loc=30), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. The class appears to be a simple interface or abstract class defining reader functionality with minimal implementation, which is appropriate for its role. No further decomposition is warranted given its small size and low complexity."
