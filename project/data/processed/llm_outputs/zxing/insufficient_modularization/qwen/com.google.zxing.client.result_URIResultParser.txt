{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.URIResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 4 fields (nof=4), and a small size of 38 lines of code (loc=38). The weighted method count (wmc=7) indicates low method complexity. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest proper modularization. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class."
