    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.CodaBarWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (1 public), 4 fields, and WMC of 22. The LOC is 99 which is reasonable for a specialized writer class. LCOM of 1.0 indicates good cohesion, and DIT of 1 shows it doesn't inherit from other classes. The minimal dependencies suggest focused responsibility. While further decomposition could be possible, the current modularization appears sufficient given the low complexity metrics."
