    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.DataMask",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 84 lines of code (loc=84), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=13) indicates reasonable complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies except for BitMatrix, this appears to be a well-focused utility class that encapsulates data mask operations without excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
