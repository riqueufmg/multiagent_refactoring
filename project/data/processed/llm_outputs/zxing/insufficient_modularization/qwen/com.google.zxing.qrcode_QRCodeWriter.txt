    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 13 weighted method count (wmc=13), and 67 lines of code (loc=67). The lack of class dependencies (dit=0, nc=0) and low method count (nopm=3) indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
