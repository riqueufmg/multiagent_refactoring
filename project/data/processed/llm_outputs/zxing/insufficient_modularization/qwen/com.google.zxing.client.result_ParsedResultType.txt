    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.ParsedResultType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 dependencies. It appears to be a simple enum or constant class that does not require further decomposition. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that would not benefit from additional modularization."
