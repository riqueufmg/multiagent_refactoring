    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 14 lines of code (loc=14), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no fields (nof=0), the class does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
