    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods and WMC of 10, but LCOM of 0.286 indicates good cohesion. With only 46 lines of code and 2 fields, the class size is reasonable. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
