```json
{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.book.SearchBookContentsAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 1 public method (nopm=1), 27 lines of code (loc=27), and weighted method count of 4 (wmc=4). These metrics indicate a relatively small and simple class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low number of methods and lines of code suggest the class is already adequately decomposed."
