    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) with 4 public methods (nopm=4), 64 lines of code (loc=64), and a low weighted method count (wmc=8). The low number of methods and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
