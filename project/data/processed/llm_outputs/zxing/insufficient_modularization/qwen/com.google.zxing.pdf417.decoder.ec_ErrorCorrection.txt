    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ErrorCorrection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high implementation complexity as indicated by WMC of 23 with only 5 methods, suggesting methods are overly complex. The class also has 129 lines of code which is relatively high for proper modularization. With 5 methods handling error correction logic, further decomposition could reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
