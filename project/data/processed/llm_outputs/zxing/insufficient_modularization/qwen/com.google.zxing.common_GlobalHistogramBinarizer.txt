{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.GlobalHistogramBinarizer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 29 and LOC of 139, contains 6 methods with 4 private methods indicating significant internal complexity, and has low cohesion as indicated by LCOM of 0.333. The class implements multiple responsibilities including histogram calculation, threshold determination, and binarization operations that could be decomposed into separate modules. The high method count (6) and weighted method count (29) suggest the class is doing too much work that could be better distributed."
