    "justification": "The class has a low complexity with WMC of 11, only 4 methods (NOM), and 62 lines of code (LOC). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates reasonable cohesion. With only 2 fields and 1 private method, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
