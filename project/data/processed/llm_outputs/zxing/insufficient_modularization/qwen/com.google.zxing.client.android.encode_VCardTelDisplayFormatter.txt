{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.VCardTelDisplayFormatter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 1 field (nof=1), and low weighted method count (wmc=9). The lines of code (loc=40) are minimal, indicating a focused, well-scoped responsibility. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest proper modularization. The class appears to have a single, well-defined purpose as a formatter for VCard telephone display."
