    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 17 lines of code. WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies or inheritance relationships suggesting over-complicated design. The class appears to be a simple data holder class with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
