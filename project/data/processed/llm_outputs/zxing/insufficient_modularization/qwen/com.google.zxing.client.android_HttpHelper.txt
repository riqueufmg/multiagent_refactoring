    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.HttpHelper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) and 27 weighted method complexity (wmc=27), with 161 lines of code (loc=161). The high WMC relative to the number of methods suggests complex implementations. The class also has only 1 field (nof=1) but high complexity, indicating potential for decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The LCOM value of 0.333 suggests some cohesion issues that could be improved through better modularization."
