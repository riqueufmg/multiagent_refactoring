    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.ServletContextLogHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 31 lines of code (loc=31), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and a reasonable lack of cohesion metric (lcom=0.75), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
