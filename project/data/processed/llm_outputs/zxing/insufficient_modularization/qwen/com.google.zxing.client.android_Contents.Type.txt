    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields and 0 methods, with a very low LOC count of 31. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0) indicate this is a simple data class or enum rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The low number of fields and absence of methods suggest it is already sufficiently modularized for its intended purpose."
