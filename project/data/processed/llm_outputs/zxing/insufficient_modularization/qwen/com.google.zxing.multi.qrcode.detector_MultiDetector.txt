{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector.MultiDetector",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 5 weighted method count (wmc=5), and 34 lines of code (loc=34). The lack of fields (nof=1, nc=0) and simple method structure (nopm=2, nopf=0) indicates proper modularization. LCOM value of 1.0 suggests good cohesion, and the class does not exhibit signs of needing further decomposition."
