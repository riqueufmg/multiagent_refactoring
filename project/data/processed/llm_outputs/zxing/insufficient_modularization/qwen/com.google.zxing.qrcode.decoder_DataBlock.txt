    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.DataBlock",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 2 fields (nof=2), with 73 lines of code (loc=73). The weighted method count (wmc=15) indicates moderate complexity but is not excessive for this size. The lack of complexity metrics (lcom=0.0, nc=0, dit=0) and zero dependencies inward (fanin=0) suggest this is a simple, well-encapsulated class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The class appears appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
