    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.DecodedNumeric",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom), 3 fields (nof), 32 lines of code (loc), and a low weighted method count (wmc=7). The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder with minimal responsibilities, which is appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
