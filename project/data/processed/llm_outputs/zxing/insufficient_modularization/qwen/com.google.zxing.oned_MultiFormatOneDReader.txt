{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.MultiFormatOneDReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 15 weighted method count (wmc=15), and 65 lines of code (loc=65). The lack of fields (nof=2, nc=0) and high cohesion (lcom=0.0) indicate proper modularization. The class directly extends OneDReader and has minimal dependencies, suggesting appropriate decomposition."
