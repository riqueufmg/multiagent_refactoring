{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder.Decoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 61 and LOC of 319, indicating it is doing too much work. It has 11 methods but only 2 are public, suggesting internal complexity that could be decomposed. The class also has multiple dependencies (9 total) including nested classes like Decoder.Table and Decoder.CorrectedBitsResult, which indicates it manages multiple responsibilities internally. With 10 fields and no inheritance (DIT=0), this suggests a large monolithic class that could benefit from further modularization into smaller, more focused components."
