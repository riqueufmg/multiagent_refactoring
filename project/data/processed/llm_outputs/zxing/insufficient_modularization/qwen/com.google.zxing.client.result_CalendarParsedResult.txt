{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.CalendarParsedResult",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19) with 15 private methods (nopm=15), indicating high implementation complexity. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 28 (wmc=28), which is high. The class has 173 lines of code (loc=173) and contains 14 fields (nof=14), suggesting it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity. The high number of private methods relative to total methods indicates internal complexity that could be better modularized."
