    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Reader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high Weighted Method Complexity (WMC=79) with only 3 methods, indicating complex implementations. The Lines of Code (LOC=326) is also high for such few methods, suggesting each method is overly complex. The class has 16 fields which likely contribute to the complexity. High WMC combined with low method count and high LOC indicates insufficient modularization where the class should be decomposed into smaller, more manageable components."
