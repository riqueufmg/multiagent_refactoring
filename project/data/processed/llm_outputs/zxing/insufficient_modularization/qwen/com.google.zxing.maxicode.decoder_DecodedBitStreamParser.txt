{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.maxicode.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 33 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 10, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 137. The high WMC value suggests the class has complex internal structure that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has 22 fields (NOF) which further indicates it may be managing too much responsibility in a single class."
