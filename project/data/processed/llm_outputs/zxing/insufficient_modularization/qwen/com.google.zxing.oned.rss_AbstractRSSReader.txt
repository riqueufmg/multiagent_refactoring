    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.AbstractRSSReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 12 methods and WMC of 22, but lacks sufficient metrics indicating insufficient modularization. LCOM of 0.5 suggests reasonable cohesion, and with only 104 lines of code, the class size is manageable. The low number of methods and moderate complexity do not clearly indicate the need for further decomposition."
