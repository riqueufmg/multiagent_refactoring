    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 45 which is high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 190 indicating a large class size, and NOM (Number of Methods) is 9. The class also has a high fanout dependency count of 6 different classes, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates cohesive methods, but the overall size and complexity suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
