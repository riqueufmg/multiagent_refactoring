    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.PreferencesFragment.CustomSearchURLValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low LOC count (31). WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. The class appears to be a simple data holder or marker class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion among existing members. This does not exhibit characteristics of Insufficient Modularization as it is already minimally complex."
