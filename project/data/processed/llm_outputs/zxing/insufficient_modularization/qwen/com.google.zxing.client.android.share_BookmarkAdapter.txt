    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (35 LOC) and complexity (WMC=6, NOM=5), with reasonable method distribution (4 private methods out of 5 total methods). The LCOM value of 0.4 indicates good cohesion. There are no external dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships to suggest modularization issues. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
