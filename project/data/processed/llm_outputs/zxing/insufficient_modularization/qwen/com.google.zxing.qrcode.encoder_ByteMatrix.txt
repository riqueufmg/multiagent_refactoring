    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.ByteMatrix",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (61 LOC, 10 methods) and low complexity (WMC=15). The method-to-field ratio is appropriate (10 methods for 3 fields), and there are no external dependencies or coupling issues. The class appears to be well-focused on its core responsibility of representing a byte matrix."
