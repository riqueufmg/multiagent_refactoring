    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.ImageReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 38 lines of code (loc=38), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=7) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and a moderate lack of cohesion (lcom=0.667), the class does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
