    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (1 public), 48 lines of code, and WMC of 9. With only 3 methods total, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The low method count and complexity metrics indicate proper modularization has been achieved."
