    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 18 methods (nom), 595 lines of code (loc), and a weighted method count of 94 (wmc). The high WMC suggests complex method implementations, while the large number of methods and lines of code indicate the class has not been sufficiently decomposed into smaller, more manageable components."
