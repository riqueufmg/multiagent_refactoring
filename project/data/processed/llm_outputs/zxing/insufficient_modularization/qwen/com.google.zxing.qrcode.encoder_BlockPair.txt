    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.BlockPair",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 2 fields (nof=2), with very low complexity (wmc=3, loc=14). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's not tightly coupled with other components. This is a small, focused class that appears to be appropriately modularized for its simple responsibility."
