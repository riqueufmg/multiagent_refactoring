    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 19 lines of code (loc=19), which indicates a very small and simple class. With 0 fields (nof=0) and low complexity (wmc=2), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple enum or utility class that is appropriately sized and structured."
