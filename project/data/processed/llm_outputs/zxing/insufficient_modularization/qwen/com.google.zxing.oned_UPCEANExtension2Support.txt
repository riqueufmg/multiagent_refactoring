    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANExtension2Support",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 fields (nof=2), and a manageable size of 62 lines of code (loc=62). The weighted method count (wmc=11) indicates moderate complexity. With only 6 dependencies and no inheritance (dit=0), the class is reasonably focused on its responsibilities for UPCEAN extension support. The lack of public methods (nopm=0) and fields (nopf=0) suggests proper encapsulation. LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class."
