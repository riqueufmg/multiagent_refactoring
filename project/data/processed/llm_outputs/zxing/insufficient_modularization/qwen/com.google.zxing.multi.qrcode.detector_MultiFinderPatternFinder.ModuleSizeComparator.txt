    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 9 lines of code (loc=9). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) indicating no complex methods. The low size and complexity metrics indicate this class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
