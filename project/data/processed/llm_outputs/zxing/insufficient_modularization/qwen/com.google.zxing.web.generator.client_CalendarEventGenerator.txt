    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.CalendarEventGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 21 methods (nom), 41 weighted method count (wmc), 235 lines of code (loc), and 14 fields (nof). The high number of methods and fields in a single class, combined with substantial lines of code, suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
