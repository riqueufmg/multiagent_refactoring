    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.detector.Detector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 42 which is high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 259 indicating a large class size, NOM (Number of Methods) is 9 which contributes to complexity, and the class has 13 fields (NOF). These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
