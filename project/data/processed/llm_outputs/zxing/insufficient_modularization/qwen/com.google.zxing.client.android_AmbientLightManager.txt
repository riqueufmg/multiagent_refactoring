{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.AmbientLightManager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5), 47 lines of code (loc=47), and weighted method count of 11 (wmc=11). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (nof=5, nopf=0) indicate it is already well modularized. The LCOM value of 0.4 suggests good cohesion within the class."
