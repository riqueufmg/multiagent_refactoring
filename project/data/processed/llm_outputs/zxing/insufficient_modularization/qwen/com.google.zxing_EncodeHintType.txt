    "class": "com.google.zxing.EncodeHintType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 64 lines of code, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), and no dependencies. While it could potentially be decomposed further, the current size and complexity are minimal enough that further decomposition would likely over-engineer rather than improve the design. The lack of any structural complexity indicators (no methods, fields, or dependencies) suggests this is likely an enumeration or simple data class that is already sufficiently modularized."
