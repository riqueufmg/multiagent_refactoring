    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 26 lines of code (loc=26), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 nested class (nc=1) and no fields (nof=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
