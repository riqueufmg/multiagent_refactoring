    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.FormatInformation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods and WMC of 16, but LCOM of 0.25 indicates good cohesion. With only 76 lines of code and 4 fields, the class size is reasonable. The low number of methods (8) and relatively low WMC suggest the class is not overly complex. While further decomposition could be possible, the current level of modularization appears sufficient given the class's responsibilities and complexity metrics."
