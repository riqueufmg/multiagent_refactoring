    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer.MinimalEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 0 methods, with 160 lines of code. While the LOC is relatively high, the low number of fields and absence of methods suggest this is likely a data-only class or inner class with minimal complexity. Without methods to decompose and given the limited scope indicated by the metrics, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization."
