    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.SMSParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods and WMC of 15, but LCOM is 0.0 indicating good cohesion. With only 78 lines of code and 4 fields, the class is reasonably sized. The class has no fan-in or fan-out dependencies suggesting it's self-contained. While there are public methods that could potentially be refactored, the current modularization appears sufficient given the class size and complexity metrics."
