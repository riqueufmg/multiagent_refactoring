    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.ContactEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 50 lines of code (loc=50), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=11) is also low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 dependencies and no fan-in or fan-out, the class appears to be well-contained and not overly complex. The lack of fields (nof=0) and parameters (nopf=0, nopm=0) further suggests simplicity. While the LCOM value is negative, this alone does not indicate insufficient modularization given the overall small size and low complexity metrics."
