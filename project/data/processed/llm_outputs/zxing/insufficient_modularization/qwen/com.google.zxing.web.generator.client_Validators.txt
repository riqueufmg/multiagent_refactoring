    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.Validators",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 33 lines of code (loc=33), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=10) is low, suggesting low complexity. The class has no fields (nof=0) and no outgoing dependencies except for one exception class, indicating it's likely a utility or helper class with focused responsibility. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized and decomposed."
