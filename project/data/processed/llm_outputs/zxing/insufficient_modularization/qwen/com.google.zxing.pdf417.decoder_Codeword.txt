    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) and 50 lines of code (loc=50), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low complexity (wmc=12) suggest proper modularization. The class appears to be well-decomposed with appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
