{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.GUIRunner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 68 lines of code (loc=68), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and 5 methods, the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion among the class members."
