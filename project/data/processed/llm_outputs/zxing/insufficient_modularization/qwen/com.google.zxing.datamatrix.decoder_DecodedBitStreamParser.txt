    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 103 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 432 indicating a large class size, and NOM (Number of Methods) is 11. The high WMC value suggests the class has methods with high cyclomatic complexity or too many methods, and the substantial LOC count indicates the class has not been adequately decomposed into smaller, more manageable components."
