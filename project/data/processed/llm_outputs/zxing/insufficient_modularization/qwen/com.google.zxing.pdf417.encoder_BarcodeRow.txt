    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 2 fields (nof=2), with low complexity (wmc=7, loc=51). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and there are no dependencies or inheritance (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The class size and complexity are within reasonable limits for a single cohesive unit."
