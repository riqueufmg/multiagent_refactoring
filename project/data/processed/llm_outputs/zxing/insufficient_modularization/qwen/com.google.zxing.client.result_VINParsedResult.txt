    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.VINParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods and 66 lines of code, which is relatively small. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 12, indicating low complexity. The class has only one dependency and no inheritance (DIT=1), suggesting it's a simple, focused class that appropriately encapsulates VIN parsing functionality without excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
