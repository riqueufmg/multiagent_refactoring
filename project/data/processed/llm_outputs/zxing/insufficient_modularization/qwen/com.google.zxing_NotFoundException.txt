{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.NotFoundException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 methods (1 public), 15 lines of code, and WMC of 2. It appears to be a simple exception class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. The low number of fields (1) and methods indicates sufficient modularization."
