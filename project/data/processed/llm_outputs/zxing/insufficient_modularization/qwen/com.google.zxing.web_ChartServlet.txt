```json
{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.ChartServlet",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 4 methods and WMC of 15, but the LOC is 115 which is reasonable for a servlet implementation. The class has 2 fields and manages dependencies to 6 external classes which is acceptable. While further decomposition could be possible, the current modularization appears sufficient given the class size and complexity metrics."
