    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.VEventResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) with 1 private method (nopm=1), WMC of 13 indicates moderate complexity, and LOC of 77 is relatively small. The class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. DIT of 1 indicates it's a base class with no inheritance hierarchy issues. The low number of methods and moderate complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
