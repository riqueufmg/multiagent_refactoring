{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 31 methods (nom), 442 lines of code (loc), and weighted method count of 89 (wmc). With only 4 fields (nof) and 0.06 LCOM value suggesting some cohesion, the high method count and LOC suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
