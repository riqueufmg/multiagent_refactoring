{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.PDF417",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 9 public methods (nopm=9), with a Weighted Methods per Class of 31 (wmc=31), indicating high complexity. The class also has 234 lines of code (loc=234) which is substantial for a single class. It depends on 5 other classes, suggesting it coordinates multiple responsibilities. The low LCOM value (0.1428571428571428) indicates high cohesion, but the high method count and complexity suggest this class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce implementation complexity."
