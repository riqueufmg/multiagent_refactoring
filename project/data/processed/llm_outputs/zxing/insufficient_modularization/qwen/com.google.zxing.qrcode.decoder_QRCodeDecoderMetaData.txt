    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 1 field (nof=1), with low complexity (wmc=4, loc=28). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the low number of methods and fields suggests the class is already well-decomposed and not overly complex."
