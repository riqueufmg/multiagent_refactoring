{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement.ProductResultInfoRetriever",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 4 fields (nof=4), and low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lines of code (loc=31) are minimal, indicating a small and focused class. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the depth of inheritance tree (dit=1) indicates it's a base class with no inheritance complexity. The low fanin (0) and fanout (0) indicate minimal coupling. These metrics suggest the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
