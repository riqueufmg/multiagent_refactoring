{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.CommandLineRunner",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high implementation complexity as indicated by WMC value of 26 with only 6 methods, suggesting methods are overly complex. The LOC count of 118 is relatively high for a single class, and the negative LCOM value of -1.0 indicates poor cohesion among methods and attributes, suggesting the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
