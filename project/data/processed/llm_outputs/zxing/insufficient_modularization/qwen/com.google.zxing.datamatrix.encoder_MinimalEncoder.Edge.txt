    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.MinimalEncoder.Edge",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 fields but no methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0), indicating it functions as a data holder rather than a complex class requiring decomposition. While the class has 338 lines of code, this is likely due to field declarations and possibly inner class definitions rather than complex implementation logic that would warrant further modularization."
