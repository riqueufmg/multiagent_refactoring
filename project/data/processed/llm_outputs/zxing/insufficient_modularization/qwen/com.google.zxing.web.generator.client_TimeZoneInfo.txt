{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.TimeZoneInfo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 24 lines of code (loc=24), which indicates a small and manageable size. The lack of fields (nof=4 but nopf=0 suggests they are not public) and methods (nopm=0) indicates low complexity. The WMC of 5 matches the number of methods, suggesting simple method complexity. LCOM of 0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class. The absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests the class is self-contained and not overly coupled with other components. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized and decomposed."
