{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.DefaultGridSampler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 37 lines of code (loc=37), with a low weighted method count (wmc=7). The class directly uses only 3 dependencies and has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The size and complexity metrics indicate a well-modularized class that is appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
