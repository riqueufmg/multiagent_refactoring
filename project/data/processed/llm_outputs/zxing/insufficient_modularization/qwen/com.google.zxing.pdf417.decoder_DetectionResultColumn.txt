    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResultColumn",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods and WMC of 16, but the LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion. With only 63 lines of code and 3 fields, the class size is reasonable. The low number of methods (8 total, 1 public) and fields (3 total, 0 public) suggests appropriate encapsulation and modularization. No clear indication of incomplete decomposition or excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
