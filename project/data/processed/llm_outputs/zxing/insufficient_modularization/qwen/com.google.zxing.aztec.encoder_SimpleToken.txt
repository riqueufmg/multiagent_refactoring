    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.SimpleToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 fields (nof=2), and 17 lines of code (loc=17). The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=3) is low, indicating simple implementation complexity. The Depth of Inheritance Tree (dit=1) shows no inheritance hierarchy to manage. Lack of Composition (nc=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest the class is simple and focused. The Low Cohesion Metric (lcom=0.0) indicates high cohesion, meaning the class methods and fields are well-related to each other. These metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
