    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeThread",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 3 methods (nom=3) and weighted method count of 12 (wmc=12), which is within acceptable ranges. The lines of code (loc=61) is relatively small. While the class has 6 dependencies, this is not excessive for a thread class that needs to interact with various components. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0) actually indicates good internal cohesion. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
