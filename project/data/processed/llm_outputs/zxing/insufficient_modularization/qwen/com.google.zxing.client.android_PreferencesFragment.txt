    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.PreferencesFragment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 70 lines of code (loc=70), and weighted method count of 8 (wmc=8). These metrics indicate a relatively small and simple class. The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and low complexity metrics suggest adequate modularization for its size and purpose."
