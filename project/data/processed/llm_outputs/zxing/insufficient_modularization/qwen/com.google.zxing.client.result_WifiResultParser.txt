```json
{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.WifiResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 33 lines of code (loc=33), and weighted method count of 6 (wmc=6). The single method likely handles the complete responsibility of parsing WiFi results, which is a cohesive and focused functionality. No indicators of insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized and decomposed for its purpose."
