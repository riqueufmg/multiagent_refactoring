    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.BitMatrixParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 8 methods with a Weighted Method Count (WMC) of 35, and 175 lines of code (LOC). The high WMC value suggests significant implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. With 4 fields and multiple responsibilities likely involved in parsing bit matrix data, the class would benefit from being broken down into smaller, more focused components to reduce both size and complexity."
