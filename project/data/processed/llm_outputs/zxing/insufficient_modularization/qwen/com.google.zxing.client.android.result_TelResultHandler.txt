    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.TelResultHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6), 8 weighted method count (wmc=8), and 36 lines of code (loc=36). The LCOM value of 0.833 suggests good cohesion within the class. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains proper encapsulation. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality, handling telephone result parsing specifically."
