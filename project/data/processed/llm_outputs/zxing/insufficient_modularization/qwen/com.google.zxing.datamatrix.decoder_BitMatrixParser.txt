    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.BitMatrixParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 11 methods with a Weighted Method Count (WMC) of 71, and 372 lines of code (LOC). The high WMC value indicates significant implementation complexity, while the substantial LOC suggests the class handles too many responsibilities without adequate decomposition. With 3 fields and 11 methods but no public methods or fields, this suggests a complex internal structure that could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
