{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.detector.Detector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 32 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 11 with only 2 private methods suggesting poor encapsulation, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 249 which is quite large for a single class. The class also has multiple dependencies (5 external classes) and a high number of total methods, indicating it likely contains too much responsibility and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
