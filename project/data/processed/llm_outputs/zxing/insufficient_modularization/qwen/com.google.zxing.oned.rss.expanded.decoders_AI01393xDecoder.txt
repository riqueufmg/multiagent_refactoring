    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=5, LOC=33, NOM=2) and no code smells indicators. It has minimal responsibilities with only 3 fields and 2 methods, and shows good cohesion (LCOM=1.0). The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
