    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of Insufficient Modularization based on high complexity metrics: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 73 which is very high, indicating excessive method complexity; LOC (Lines of Code) is 362 which is substantial for a single class; NOM (Number of Methods) is 11 which combined with high WMC suggests method complexity; the class has 9 fields and multiple responsibilities including decoding logic, pattern finding, and result processing as evidenced by its dependencies on various utility classes and exception types."
