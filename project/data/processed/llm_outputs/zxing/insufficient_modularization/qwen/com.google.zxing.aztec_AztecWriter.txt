    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 54 lines of code (loc=54), and weighted method count of 13 (wmc=13). These metrics indicate a relatively small and simple class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be properly decomposed with a manageable size and complexity."
