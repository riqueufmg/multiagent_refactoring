{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.EncodeActivity",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods with a total of 159 lines of code and a weighted method count (WMC) of 21, indicating high complexity. The low LCOM value of 0.2857 suggests cohesive methods, but the class still handles multiple responsibilities including encoding logic and UI management. With 5 fields and 7 methods, the class exceeds typical thresholds for sufficient modularization, suggesting it could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
