    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.EdifactEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high Weighted Method Complexity (WMC=21) with only 5 methods, indicating complex implementations. The Lines of Code (LOC=109) are relatively high for such a small number of methods, suggesting methods are doing too much work. The class has no fields (NOF=0) but has significant behavioral complexity, and the negative LCOM value (LCOM=-1.0) indicates poor cohesion. These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce implementation complexity and improve modularity."
