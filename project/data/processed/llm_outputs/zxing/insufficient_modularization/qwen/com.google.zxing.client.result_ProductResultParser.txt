    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.ProductResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=24), and low weighted method count (wmc=4). The class performs a single responsibility of parsing product results and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
