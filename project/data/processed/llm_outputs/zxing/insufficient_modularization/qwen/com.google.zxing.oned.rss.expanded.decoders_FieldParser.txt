    "justification": "The class has high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC=18) and a large number of lines of code (LOC=244), indicating high complexity and size that could benefit from further decomposition. The class contains 6 fields and 4 methods, suggesting it may be handling multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
