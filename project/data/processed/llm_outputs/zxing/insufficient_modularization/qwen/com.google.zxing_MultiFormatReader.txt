    "class": "com.google.zxing.MultiFormatReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods and WMC of 26, but LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion. With only 126 lines of code and 3 fields, the class size is reasonable. The class directly implements Reader interface and manages dependencies appropriately for its role as a multi-format reader delegating to specific format readers."
