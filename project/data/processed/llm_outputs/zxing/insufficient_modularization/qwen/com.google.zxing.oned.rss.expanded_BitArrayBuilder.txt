    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.BitArrayBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 45 lines of code (loc=45), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=11) is moderate, and there are no fields (nof=0) or complex dependencies that would suggest insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
