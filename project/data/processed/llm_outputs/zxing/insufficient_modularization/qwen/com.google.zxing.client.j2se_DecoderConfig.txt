    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecoderConfig",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1) and 5 weighted method count (wmc=5). It contains 13 fields but these appear to be configuration properties that logically belong together. The class has no dependencies on other classes beyond basic enum types, and no fan-in or fan-out relationships. The low method count and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization for its purpose as a configuration class."
