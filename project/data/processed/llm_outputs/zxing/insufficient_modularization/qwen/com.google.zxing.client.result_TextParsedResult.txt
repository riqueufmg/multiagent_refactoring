```json
{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.TextParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4), 22 lines of code (loc=22), and low weighted method count (wmc=4). It has only 2 fields (nof=2) and follows single responsibility principle by representing a simple parsed result. The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion, and DIT=1 shows it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy. The class size and complexity are appropriate for its functionality."
