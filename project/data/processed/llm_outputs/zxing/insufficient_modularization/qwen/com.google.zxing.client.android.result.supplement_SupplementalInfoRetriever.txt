    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement.SupplementalInfoRetriever",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 25 and LOC of 121, indicating substantial implementation complexity. It also has a high LCOM value of 0.625 suggesting weak cohesion among methods. The class contains 8 methods with only 2 being public, indicating potential for further decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The presence of multiple dependencies on similar supplement classes (URIResultInfoRetriever, BookResultInfoRetriever, ProductResultInfoRetriever, TitleRetriever) suggests this class may be aggregating functionality that could be better distributed."
