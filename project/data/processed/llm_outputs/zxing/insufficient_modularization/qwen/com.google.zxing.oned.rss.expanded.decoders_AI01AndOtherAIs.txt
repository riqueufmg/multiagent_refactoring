    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.AI01AndOtherAIs",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (1 public), 19 lines of code, and a Weighted Method Count of 2. The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
