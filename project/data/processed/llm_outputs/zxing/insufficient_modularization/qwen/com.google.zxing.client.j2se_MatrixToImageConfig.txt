    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.MatrixToImageConfig",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 41 lines of code (loc=41), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=8) indicates low complexity. With only 4 fields (nof=4) and 2 public fields (nopf=2), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance (dit=0) suggests this is a simple, focused configuration class that is appropriately modularized."
