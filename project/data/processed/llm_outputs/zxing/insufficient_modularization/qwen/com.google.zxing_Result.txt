{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.Result",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 14 methods and 99 lines of code, which is within acceptable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) of 19 indicates reasonable method complexity. The class has no nested classes (nc=0) and no inheritance (dit=0), suggesting it's a straightforward, focused class. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion in Methods) of 0.0 indicates high cohesion, meaning the methods are well-related to each other. With only 7 fields and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains good encapsulation. The dependencies are minimal and related to core functionality (ResultMetadataType, ResultPoint, BarcodeFormat), suggesting proper separation of concerns."
