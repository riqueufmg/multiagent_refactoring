    "justification": "The class has moderate size (39 LOC, 7 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=9, LCOM=0.286). The low LCOM value indicates good cohesion among methods. With only 1 field and manageable method count, further decomposition would not significantly improve modularity or reduce complexity."
