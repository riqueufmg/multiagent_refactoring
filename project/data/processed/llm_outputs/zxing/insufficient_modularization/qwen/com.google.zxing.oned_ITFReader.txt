    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods and WMC of 30, LOC is 225 which is reasonable for a reader implementation. LCOM is 0.0 indicating good cohesion, and DIT is 1 showing no inheritance complexity. The number of fields (11) and methods (8) are within acceptable ranges for a single-responsibility class handling ITF barcode reading."
