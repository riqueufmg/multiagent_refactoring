{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.EmailAddressResultHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5), 7 weighted method count (wmc=7), and 28 lines of code (loc=28). The lack of fields (nof=1, nc=0) and high cohesion (lcom=0.8) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple handler with focused responsibility."
