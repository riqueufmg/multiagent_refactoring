    "justification": "The class has 12 methods with a WMC of 18, indicating moderate complexity. With only 3 fields and 105 lines of code, the class is relatively small and focused. The low LCOM value of 0.167 suggests good cohesion among methods. The class appears to be well-modularized with appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
