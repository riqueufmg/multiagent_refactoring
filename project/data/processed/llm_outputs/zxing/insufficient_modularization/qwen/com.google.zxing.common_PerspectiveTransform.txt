    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.PerspectiveTransform",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (86 LOC) with 9 fields and 8 methods, indicating reasonable decomposition. The WMC of 11 suggests manageable complexity, and LCOM of 0.0 indicates good cohesion. The absence of dependencies and reasonable method-to-field ratio (8 methods for 9 fields) suggests the class is well-modularized for its purpose."
