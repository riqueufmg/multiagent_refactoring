    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.SmsAddressGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods and WMC of 14, but LCOM value of 0.25 indicates good cohesion. With only 65 lines of code and 3 fields, the class size is reasonable. The class appears to be well-focused on its specific responsibility of generating SMS addresses, and the dependencies are minimal and related to styling, validation, and exception handling which are appropriate for its functionality."
