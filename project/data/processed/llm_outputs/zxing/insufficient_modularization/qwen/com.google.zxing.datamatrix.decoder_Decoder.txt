    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Decoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (77 LOC) and complexity (WMC=9) for its functionality. It has 4 methods with only 1 field, indicating proper decomposition. The LCOM value of 0.5 suggests good cohesion. The number of dependencies (9) is acceptable for a decoder class that needs to coordinate with various components for data matrix decoding. No clear indication of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
