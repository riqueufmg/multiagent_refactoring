    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.EmailAddressResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1) and 10 weighted method count (wmc=10). The lines of code (loc=57) are reasonable for a single-method class. The lack of fields (nof=1, nc=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1) indicate proper modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class."
