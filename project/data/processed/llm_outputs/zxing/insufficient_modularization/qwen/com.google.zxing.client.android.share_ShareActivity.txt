    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.share.ShareActivity",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 13 methods (nom), 9 fields (nof), and a Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) of 36, indicating significant implementation complexity. The Lines of Code (loc) count is 184, which is substantial for a single class. The low LCOM value (0.1538461538461538) suggests some cohesion issues. These metrics collectively indicate that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
