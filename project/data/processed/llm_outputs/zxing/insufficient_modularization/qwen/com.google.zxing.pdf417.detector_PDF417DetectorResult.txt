    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.detector.PDF417DetectorResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 25 lines of code (loc=25). It has no class-level attributes (nof=3 are likely parameters/locals, nc=0 indicates no class fields). The lack of complex dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, lcom=0.0) suggests adequate modularization for its size and purpose."
