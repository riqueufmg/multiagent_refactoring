    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.share.AppPickerActivity",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 5 weighted method count (wmc=5), and 33 lines of code (loc=33). The LCOM value of 0.6666666666666666 indicates reasonable cohesion. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
