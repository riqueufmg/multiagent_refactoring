{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.QRCodeEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: it has 15 methods (nom=15) and 266 lines of code (loc=266), with a high weighted method count (wmc=57) indicating complex implementation. The class also has numerous dependencies (10 external dependencies) suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The combination of high method count, high complexity, and multiple external dependencies indicates the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
