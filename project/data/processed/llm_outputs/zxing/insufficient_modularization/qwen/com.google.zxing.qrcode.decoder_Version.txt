    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Version",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 12 methods (nom), 23 weighted method count (wmc), and 163 lines of code (loc). The low LCOM value (0.1666666666666666) indicates cohesive methods, but the high method count and weighted method complexity suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce implementation complexity. With 10 fields and multiple responsibilities including version information management and error correction blocks handling, the class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization despite its cohesive nature."
