    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (78 LOC) and complexity (WMC=14) with only 7 methods. The low number of methods and fields (7 each) indicates proper decomposition. LCOM=0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the single dependency on PreferencesActivity indicates appropriate separation of concerns. No evidence of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
