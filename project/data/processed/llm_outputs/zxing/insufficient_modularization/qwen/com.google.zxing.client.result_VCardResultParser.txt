{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.VCardResultParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 61 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 284 indicating a large class size, and it has 11 methods with only 1 being private which suggests poor internal decomposition. The high WMC value specifically indicates that the class has too many complex methods that should be decomposed into smaller, more manageable classes or components."
