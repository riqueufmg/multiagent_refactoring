    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.Generator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 194 lines of code (loc=194), indicating a relatively large and complex class. The weighted method count (wmc=18) further confirms high implementation complexity. With 14 fields (nof=14) and only 5 private methods (nopm=5), the class lacks proper encapsulation and decomposition. The absence of inheritance (dit=0) and low cohesion indicators suggest this class could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
