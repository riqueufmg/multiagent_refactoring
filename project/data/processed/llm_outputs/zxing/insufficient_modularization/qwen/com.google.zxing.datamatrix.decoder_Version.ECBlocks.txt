    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Version.ECBlocks",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 21 lines of code (loc=21), and no dependencies. The lack of methods and low field count indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder with insufficient complexity to exhibit insufficient modularization."
