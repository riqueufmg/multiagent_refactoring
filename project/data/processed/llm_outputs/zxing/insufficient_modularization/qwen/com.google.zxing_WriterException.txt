    "class": "com.google.zxing.WriterException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 14 lines of code (loc=14), which indicates a very small and simple class. With no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this appears to be a minimal exception class that is already well-decomposed. The low complexity (wmc=3) and small size do not suggest insufficient modularization."
