    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.VCardContactEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC=27) and high Lines of Code (LOC=81) with only 5 methods, indicating high implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. The class also has a high cyclomatic complexity per method average (WMC/nom = 27/5 = 5.4), suggesting methods are overly complex and the class should be decomposed into smaller, more focused components."
