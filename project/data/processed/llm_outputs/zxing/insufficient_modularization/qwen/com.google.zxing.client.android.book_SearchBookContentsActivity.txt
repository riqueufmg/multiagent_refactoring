{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.book.SearchBookContentsActivity",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 190 lines of code (loc), 15 weighted methods (wmc), and 7 methods (nom) with only 3 being public. The high loc and wmc values indicate significant implementation complexity that could benefit from further decomposition. The class also contains an inner class dependency (NetworkTask) which suggests potential for extracting related functionality into separate modules."
