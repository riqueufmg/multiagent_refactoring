    "justification": "The class has 20 methods with 113 lines of code, which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 20, indicating moderate complexity. The LCOM value of 0.2 suggests good cohesion within the class. With only 11 fields and no dependencies, the class appears to be well-contained and appropriately modularized for its functionality."
