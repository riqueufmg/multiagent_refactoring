    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Reader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) with 5 public methods (nopm=5), 73 lines of code (loc=73), and weighted method count of 15 (wmc=15). These metrics indicate a relatively small and manageable class. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.2) suggests good internal cohesion. The class has reasonable size and complexity for its functionality, which involves reading PDF417 barcodes and coordinating with various decoder and detector components. No clear indication of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
