{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.AddressBookParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 fields and 19 methods with 137 lines of code and WMC of 22, which indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. The LCOM value is 0.0 indicating good cohesion, and with only 19 methods and 16 fields, the class is not overly large. The DIT of 1 shows it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy. While there could be some room for decomposition, the metrics do not clearly indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be of reasonable size and complexity for its purpose."
