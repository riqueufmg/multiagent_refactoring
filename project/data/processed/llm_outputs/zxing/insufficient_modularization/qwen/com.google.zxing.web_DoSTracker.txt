    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.DoSTracker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2) and 4 weighted method count (wmc=4), indicating simple implementation. The lines of code (loc=85) are reasonable for a class with its functionality. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (nof=5, lcom=0.0) suggest proper modularization without excessive coupling or internal complexity that would require further decomposition."
