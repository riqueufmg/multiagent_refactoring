    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 2 fields (nof=2), with a low weighted method count (wmc=7). The lines of code (loc=140) are reasonably sized for this number of methods. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (lcom=0.0, nc=0, dit=0) indicate it is already well modularized. No further decomposition is warranted based on the provided metrics."
