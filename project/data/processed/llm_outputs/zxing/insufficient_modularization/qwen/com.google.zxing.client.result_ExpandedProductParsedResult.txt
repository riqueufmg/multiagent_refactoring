    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.ExpandedProductParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19) and 113 lines of code (loc=113), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 20, indicating moderate complexity. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion in Methods) is 0.0, suggesting high cohesion among methods. The class has only 17 fields (nof=17) and a simple inheritance depth (dit=1). While the class could potentially be decomposed, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant decomposition based on Insufficient Modularization smell criteria."
