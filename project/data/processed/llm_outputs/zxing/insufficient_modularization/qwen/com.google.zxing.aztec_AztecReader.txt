{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 75 lines of code (loc=75) and weighted method count of 11 (wmc=11). While the class has dependencies on 12 external classes, the method count and complexity metrics are within reasonable limits for a reader class that needs to coordinate decoding operations. The low method count suggests appropriate decomposition rather than insufficient modularization."
