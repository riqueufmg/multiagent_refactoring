    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeHintManager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (162 LOC) and complexity (WMC=32) for its functionality. With only 4 methods and 2 fields, the class is adequately modularized. The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates good cohesion, and the low number of methods and fields suggests the class is properly decomposed for its intended purpose."
