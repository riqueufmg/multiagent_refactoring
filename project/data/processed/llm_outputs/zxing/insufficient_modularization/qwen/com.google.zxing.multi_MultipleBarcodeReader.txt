    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.MultipleBarcodeReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 9 lines of code (loc=9), and very low complexity (wmc=2). The low number of methods and lines of code indicate that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple interface or minimal implementation that does not require further decomposition."
