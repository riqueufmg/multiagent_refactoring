    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), and no dependencies. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT is 1 indicating no inheritance. The class appears to be a simple, minimal implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already appropriately decomposed for its current functionality."
