    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.GenericGF",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 12 methods and WMC of 20, but the LCOM value of 0.167 indicates good cohesion. The class contains 15 fields which is reasonable for a Galois Field implementation, and the 118 lines of code is manageable. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the current level of modularization appears sufficient given the cohesive nature of Galois Field operations and the relatively low complexity metrics."
