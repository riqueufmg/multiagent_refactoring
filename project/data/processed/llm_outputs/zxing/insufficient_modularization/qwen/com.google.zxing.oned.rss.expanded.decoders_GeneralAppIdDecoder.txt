{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.GeneralAppIdDecoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 18 methods (nom), 102 weighted method count (wmc), and 350 lines of code (loc). With 3 fields (nof) and 0 public fields (nopf), the class appears to encapsulate too much functionality without sufficient decomposition. The high WMC suggests complex method interactions, and the substantial LOC indicates the class handles significant logic that could benefit from further modularization into smaller, more focused classes."
