    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.ISBNResultHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5), low lines of code (32), low weighted method count (9), and reasonable LCOM value (0.8). While it has 5 public methods which could indicate some complexity, the overall size and complexity metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
