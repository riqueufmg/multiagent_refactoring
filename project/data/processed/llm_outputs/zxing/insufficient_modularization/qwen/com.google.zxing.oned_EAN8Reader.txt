    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.EAN8Reader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 1 field (nof=1), and low weighted method count (wmc=7). The lines of code (loc=39) are minimal, and the lack of complexity (lcom=0.667) is manageable. The class has limited responsibilities with only 1 public method (nopm=1) and no public fields (nopf=0). The low fan-in (0) and fan-out (0) indicate minimal coupling. The class represents a single, well-defined responsibility for reading EAN-8 barcodes and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
