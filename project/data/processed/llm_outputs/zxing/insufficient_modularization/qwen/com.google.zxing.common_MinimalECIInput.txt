    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.MinimalECIInput",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 48 which is high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 243 indicating a large class size, NOM (Number of Methods) is 13 with 10 private methods suggesting high internal complexity, and the class has 7 fields. The high WMC and large LOC suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
