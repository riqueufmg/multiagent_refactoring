    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 14 lines of code (loc=14), which indicates a very small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no public methods (nopm=0), this appears to be a simple, well-focused decoder implementation that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
