    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417ResultMetadata",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 fields and 22 methods with 120 lines of code, which represents a moderate size. The WMC of 22 indicates reasonable complexity. With LCOM of 0.5, the class shows good cohesion. The absence of dependencies and low fanout suggest it's not overly coupled. While the class could potentially benefit from some decomposition, its current size and complexity metrics do not clearly indicate insufficient modularization."
