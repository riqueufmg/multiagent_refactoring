    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.AI013x0xDecoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (1 public), 3 weighted method count, 19 lines of code, and 2 fields. The LCOM value of 1.0 indicates good cohesion. The low number of methods and fields, combined with low cyclomatic complexity, suggests the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
