    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.ECIEncoderSet",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods with a WMC of 21, which indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. With only 110 lines of code and 3 fields, the class is relatively compact. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class. While there is some room for decomposition, the current level of modularization appears sufficient given the class size and complexity metrics."
