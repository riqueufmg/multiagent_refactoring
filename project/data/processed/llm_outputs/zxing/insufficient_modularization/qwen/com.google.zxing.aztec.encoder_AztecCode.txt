    "justification": "The class has moderate size (56 LOC, 10 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=10). While it has some data clumping indicated by LCOM=0.5, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a cohesive data structure with appropriate method-to-field ratios."
