    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (59 LOC) and complexity (WMC=15) with only 5 methods, indicating reasonable modularization. The LCOM value of 0.4 suggests good cohesion within the class. With only 3 fields and 1 public method, the class does not exhibit excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
