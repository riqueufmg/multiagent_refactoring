    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 23 fields (nof=23) but no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating it is a data-only class or constant holder rather than a complex class needing decomposition. The lack of methods suggests this is intentionally designed as a simple data structure or interface, not a case of insufficient modularization."
