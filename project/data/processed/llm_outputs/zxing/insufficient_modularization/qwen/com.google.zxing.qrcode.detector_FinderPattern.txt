{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.FinderPattern",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 2 public), low complexity (WMC=7), and reasonable size (42 LOC). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low LCOM value (0.0) suggest good cohesion. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed."
