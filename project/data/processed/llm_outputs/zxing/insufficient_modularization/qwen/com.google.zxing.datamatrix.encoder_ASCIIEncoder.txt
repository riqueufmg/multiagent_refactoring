    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.ASCIIEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 12 weighted method count (wmc=12), and 52 lines of code (loc=52). The lack of fields (nof=0) and simple method count (nopm=2 public methods) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a focused, single-responsibility component with manageable size and complexity."
