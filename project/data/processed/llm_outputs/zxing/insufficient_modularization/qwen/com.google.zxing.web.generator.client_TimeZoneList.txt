    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal lines of code (loc=11), no fields (nof=3 but nopf=0 indicating no public fields), and no inheritance (dit=0) or coupling issues (lcom=0.0). The size and complexity are appropriate for its functionality, and there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
