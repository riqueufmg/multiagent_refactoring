    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 8 lines of code (loc=8). It also has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance (dit=0). The lack of any structural complexity or dependencies indicates this class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
