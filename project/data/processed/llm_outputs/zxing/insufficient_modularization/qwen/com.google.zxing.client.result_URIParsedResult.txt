    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.URIParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (51 LOC, 7 methods) and low complexity (WMC=9). It follows single responsibility principle by representing a parsed URI result. The lack of fields (NOF=2, all private) and low LCOM value (0.0) indicate good cohesion. No inheritance hierarchy (DIT=1) and minimal method complexity suggest sufficient modularization."
