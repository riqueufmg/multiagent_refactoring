    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.CurrentParsingState",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 39 lines of code (loc=39), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=10) aligns with the number of methods, suggesting straightforward implementation complexity. The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), indicating proper encapsulation. The Lack of Cohesion metric (lcom=0.0) suggests good cohesion among methods. With only one dependency on its inner State enum, the class maintains low coupling. These metrics collectively indicate sufficient modularization."
