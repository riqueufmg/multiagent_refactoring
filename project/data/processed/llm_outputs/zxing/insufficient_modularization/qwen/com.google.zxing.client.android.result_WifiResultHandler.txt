    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (45 LOC) and complexity (WMC=9), with only 7 methods. The LCOM value of 0.857 suggests good cohesion within the class. The low number of fields (2) and methods (7) indicates proper modularization without excessive complexity that would require further decomposition."
