    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Version",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (115 LOC, 11 methods, 12 fields) and reasonable complexity (WMC=15). The LCOM value of 0.18 indicates good cohesion, suggesting the class is well-organized internally. With only 11 methods and 12 fields, the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The metrics suggest sufficient modularization has already been achieved."
