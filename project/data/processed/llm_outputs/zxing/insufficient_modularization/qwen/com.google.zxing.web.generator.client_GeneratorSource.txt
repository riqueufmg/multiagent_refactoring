    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.GeneratorSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. With 9 nested classes (nc=9) but no fields (nof=0) or public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be well-structured. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests limited complexity, and the negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) indicates good cohesion among the methods. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already reasonably small and decomposed."
