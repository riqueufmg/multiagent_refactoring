    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.EncoderContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom=21) with 19 of them being public (nopm=19), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=24) suggests high implementation complexity. With 89 lines of code (loc=89) and 9 fields (nof=9), the class encapsulates substantial functionality that could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity. The high method count and complexity metrics indicate insufficient modularization where the class has not been completely decomposed."
