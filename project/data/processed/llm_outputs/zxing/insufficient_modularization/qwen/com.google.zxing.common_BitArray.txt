{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.BitArray",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 27 methods (nom=27) with 24 public methods (nopm=24), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The weighted method count (wmc=58) is high, suggesting significant implementation complexity. With 279 lines of code (loc=279), the class is large enough that further decomposition could reduce its size and complexity. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it could potentially be split into more focused, cohesive modules."
