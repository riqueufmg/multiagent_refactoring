{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Mode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom), 16 weighted method count (wmc), and 55 lines of code (loc). The lack of fields (nof=2, all private) and low method count indicate proper modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the single dependency indicates reasonable coupling. Size and complexity metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization."
