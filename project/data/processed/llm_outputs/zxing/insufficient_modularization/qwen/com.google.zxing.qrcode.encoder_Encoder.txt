{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.Encoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 25 methods (nom=25) with a high weighted method count of 90 (wmc=90), indicating high complexity. The class also has 434 lines of code (loc=434) which is substantial. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be doing too much work with minimal data encapsulation. The low LCOM value (0.08) suggests some cohesion issues. The class has numerous dependencies (13 external classes) which indicates it is coordinating multiple responsibilities rather than having a single focused purpose, suggesting insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
