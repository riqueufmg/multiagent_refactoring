```json
{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417CodewordDecoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6), 17 weighted method count (wmc=17), and 86 lines of code (loc=86). The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate a simple, focused class. The LCOM value of 0.333 suggests good cohesion within the class. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
