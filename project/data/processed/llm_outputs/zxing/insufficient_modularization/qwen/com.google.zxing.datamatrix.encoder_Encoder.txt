    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.Encoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2) and 4 lines of code (loc=4), which indicates a very small and simple class. The lack of fields (nof=0) and parameters (nopf=0, nopm=0) suggests minimal complexity. While it has dependencies on EncoderContext, the class itself appears to be sufficiently modularized given its minimal size and complexity."
