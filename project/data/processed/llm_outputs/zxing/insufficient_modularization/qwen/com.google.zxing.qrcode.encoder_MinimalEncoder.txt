    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MinimalEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 13 methods (nom), 46 weighted method count (wmc), and 382 lines of code (loc). The high WMC relative to the number of methods suggests complex method implementations. With 17 fields (nof) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains significant internal state. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low cohesion indicators (lcom=0.0) combined with the substantial size and complexity metrics suggest this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
