{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANExtension5Support",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods and WMC of 25, but the LOC is 112 which is reasonable for a specialized barcode processing class. The class has 3 fields with no public fields, and no inheritance (DIT=0). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class. While the class could potentially be decomposed, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization given its specialized purpose in barcode extension support."
