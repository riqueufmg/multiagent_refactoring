    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.DecodeServlet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 41 and LOC of 349, indicating it handles too many responsibilities. It has 8 methods with only 2 being public, suggesting internal complexity that could be decomposed. The class has 9 fields and 8 methods, showing significant internal state and behavior that could be better organized into smaller, more focused classes. The high method count and complexity metrics suggest insufficient modularization where related functionality could be grouped into separate cohesive units."
