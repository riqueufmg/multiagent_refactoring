    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 5 lines of code (loc=5). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Since the class is already minimal and does not contain any methods or complex logic, there is no opportunity for further decomposition to reduce size or complexity."
