    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.C40Encoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC=36) and a large number of Lines of Code (LOC=170), indicating high complexity that could benefit from further decomposition. The class contains 8 methods with only 2 being public, suggesting internal complexity that is not well exposed. The high WMC value indicates the class has significant implementation complexity that could be reduced through better modularization into smaller, more focused classes."
