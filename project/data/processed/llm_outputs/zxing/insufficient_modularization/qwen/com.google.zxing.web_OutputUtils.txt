    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.OutputUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 33 lines of code (loc=33), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and a reasonable lack of cohesion (lcom=0.667), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already well-decomposed and maintains a simple structure."
