    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 22 methods (nom), 107 weighted method count (wmc), and 536 lines of code (loc). It also has 9 fields (nof) and multiple dependencies including 8 external classes, indicating it handles too many responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
