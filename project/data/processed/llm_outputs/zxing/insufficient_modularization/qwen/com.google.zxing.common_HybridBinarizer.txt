    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.HybridBinarizer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods and WMC of 33, but LCOM of 0.4285714285714285 indicates good cohesion. The LOC of 145 is reasonable for a class with this functionality. The class has single inheritance (DIT=1) and no nested classes (NC=0), suggesting appropriate modularization for its scope and responsibilities."
