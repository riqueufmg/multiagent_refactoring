    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivityHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 4 methods (nom=4) and weighted method count of 16 (wmc=16). With only 91 lines of code (loc=91) and 5 fields (nof=5), the class size and complexity are within reasonable limits. The lack of class-level dependencies (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0) suggest proper modularization. While further decomposition could be possible, there is insufficient evidence of excessive size or complexity to indicate Insufficient Modularization."
