    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5), 3 instance variables (nof=3), and 30 lines of code (loc=30). The Weighted Method Count (wmc=5) is low, indicating simple method implementations. The Lack of Cohesion (lcom=0.0) suggests good internal cohesion. With only 5 methods and 3 fields, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
