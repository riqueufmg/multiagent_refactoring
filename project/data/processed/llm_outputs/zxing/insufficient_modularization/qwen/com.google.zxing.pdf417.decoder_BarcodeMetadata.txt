    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6), 0 public methods (nopm=0), low weighted method count (wmc=6), and minimal size (loc=32). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (nof=5 fields, lcom=0.0) indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
