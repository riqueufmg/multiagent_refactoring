    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.WifiParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 12 methods (nom=12), 63 lines of code (loc=63), and no class fields (nof=8, nc=0). The WMC is low at 12, DIT is minimal at 1, and LCOM indicates good cohesion at 0.0. The class appears to be properly modularized with appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
