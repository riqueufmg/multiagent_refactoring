{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.ResultHandlerFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 1 private method (nopm=1), 27 lines of code (loc=27), and weighted method count of 13 (wmc=13). While the WMC is relatively high for the number of methods, the class is small in terms of methods and lines of code, suggesting it is already well-decomposed. The low number of methods and compact size indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
