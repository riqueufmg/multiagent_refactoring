    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 14 methods and WMC of 47, indicating significant implementation complexity. The LOC count of 224 suggests the class is large enough to potentially benefit from decomposition. With only 3 fields and low LCOM value of 0.214, it may contain cohesive functionality that could be better separated into distinct modules."
