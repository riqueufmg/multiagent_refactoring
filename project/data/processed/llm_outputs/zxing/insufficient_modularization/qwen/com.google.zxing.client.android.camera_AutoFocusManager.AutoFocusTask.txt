    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.AutoFocusManager.AutoFocusTask",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies. This indicates a minimal class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed or serves a very specific, simple purpose."
