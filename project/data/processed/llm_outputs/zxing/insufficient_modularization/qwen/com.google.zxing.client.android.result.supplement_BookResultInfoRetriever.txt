{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement.BookResultInfoRetriever",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 3 fields (nof=3), and a low weighted method count (wmc=7). The lines of code (loc=53) are relatively small, and the lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate it is already well modularized. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class."
