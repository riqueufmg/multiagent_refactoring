```json
{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.ISBNParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), low weighted method count (wmc=3), single level of inheritance (dit=1), no class dependencies (nc=0), and minimal size (loc=17). The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion. These metrics suggest the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
