    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 3 fields (nof=3), and a small size of 26 lines of code (loc=26). The weighted method count (wmc=3) indicates low behavioral complexity. With only 3 dependencies and no inheritance (dit=1), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
