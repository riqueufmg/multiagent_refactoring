    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.SymbolInfo",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 38 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 21 with only 10 fields suggesting poor distribution of responsibilities, and LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) is 0.19 indicating methods are not cohesive. The class implements too many responsibilities with relatively high method count (21 methods) and weighted complexity, suggesting it should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
