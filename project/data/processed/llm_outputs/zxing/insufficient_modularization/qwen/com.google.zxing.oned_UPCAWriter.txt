    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.UPCAWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 16 lines of code (loc=16), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class-level dependencies (dit=0, nc=0), this class appears to be appropriately modularized for its simple responsibility of writing UPCA barcodes."
