    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 27 lines of code. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. WMC is 0, NOM is 0, and there are no dependencies, suggesting this is a simple data holder class that is already sufficiently modularized."
