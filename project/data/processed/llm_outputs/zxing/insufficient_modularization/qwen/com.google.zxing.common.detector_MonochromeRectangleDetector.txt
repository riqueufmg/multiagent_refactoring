    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.detector.MonochromeRectangleDetector",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 2 fields (nof=2), with a moderate WMC of 21. The LOC is 147 which is reasonable for a detector class. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the lack of inheritance (DIT=0) and composition (NC=0) relationships suggests a simple, focused class that is appropriately modularized for its purpose."
