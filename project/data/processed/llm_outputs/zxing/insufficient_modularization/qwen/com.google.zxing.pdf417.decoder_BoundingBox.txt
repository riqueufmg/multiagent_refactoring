    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods and 117 lines of code with a WMC of 23, which while substantial, does not indicate insufficient modularization given its likely cohesive responsibility of handling bounding box operations. The metrics do not clearly demonstrate that further decomposition would reduce complexity or size meaningfully."
