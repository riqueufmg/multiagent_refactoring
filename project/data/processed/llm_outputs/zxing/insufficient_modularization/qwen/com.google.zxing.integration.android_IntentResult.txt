    "justification": "The class has a low number of fields (5), methods (8), and lines of code (55), with a simple complexity metric (WMC=8). The low LCOM value (0.25) indicates good cohesion among class members. The class appears to be a simple data holder/transfer object with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
