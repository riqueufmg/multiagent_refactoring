    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ModulusGF",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 11 methods and WMC of 18, but this is appropriate for a mathematical field implementation. The LOC is 75 which is reasonable for the functionality. The class has 6 fields which is acceptable. No high complexity metrics (WMC <= 20, LOC <= 100, NOM <= 20) indicate insufficient modularization. The LCOM of 0.0 suggests good cohesion."
