    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 9 methods with WMC of 61, and 261 lines of code. The LCOM value of 0.222 suggests some cohesion issues. With 2 fields and 9 methods but no public methods or fields, this suggests a utility-like class that may be doing too much internally. The high WMC (61) relative to the number of methods (9) indicates complex method implementations, supporting insufficient modularization."
