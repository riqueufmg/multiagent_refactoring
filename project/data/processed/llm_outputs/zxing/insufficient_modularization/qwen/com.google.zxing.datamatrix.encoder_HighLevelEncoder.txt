    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.HighLevelEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 21 methods (nom), 73 weighted method count (wmc), and 371 lines of code (loc). The high number of methods and weighted method complexity suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
