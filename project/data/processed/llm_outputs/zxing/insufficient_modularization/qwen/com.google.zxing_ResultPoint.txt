    "class": "com.google.zxing.ResultPoint",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (82 LOC, 9 methods) with low complexity (WMC=13) and good cohesion (LCOM=0.0). The low number of fields (2) and methods (9) indicates proper decomposition. No external dependencies or fan-in/fan-out complexity suggest this class is well-modularized and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
