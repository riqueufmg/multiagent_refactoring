    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.VINResultParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 54 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 153 indicating a large class size, and NOM (Number of Methods) is 7 with only 1 public method suggesting poor decomposition. The high WMC value particularly indicates that the class has complex internal logic that could benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more manageable components."
