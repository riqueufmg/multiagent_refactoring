    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code39Writer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (104 loc) and complexity (WMC=26) for a specialized writer class. With only 4 methods (1 public) and no fields, it follows single responsibility principle. The low DIT=1 indicates it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy, and the lack of dependencies suggests good encapsulation. While LCOM=-1.0 could indicate cohesion issues, the class appears to be a focused implementation of a barcode writing algorithm with appropriate complexity for its domain."
