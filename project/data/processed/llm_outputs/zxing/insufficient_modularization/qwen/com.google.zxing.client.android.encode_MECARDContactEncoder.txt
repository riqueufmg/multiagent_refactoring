{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.MECARDContactEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 41 lines of code, 5 fields, and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion. The class size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a small, focused class with appropriate responsibilities."
