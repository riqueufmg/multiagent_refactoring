    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 5 methods (nom=5) and weighted method count of 24 (wmc=24). The lines of code (loc=103) is reasonable for its functionality. LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and DIT of 1 shows it's not deeply inherited. The number of fields (nof=4) and methods (nom=5) suggest appropriate size without excessive responsibilities that would require further decomposition."
