    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.ECIInput",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6, wmc=6) and 44 lines of code (loc=44), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. With no fields (nof=0) and only 1 nested class (nc=1), the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The low method count and simple structure suggest adequate modularization."
