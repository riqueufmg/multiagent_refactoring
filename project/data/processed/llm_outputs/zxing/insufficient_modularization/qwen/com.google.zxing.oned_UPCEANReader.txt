{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 40 which is high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 279 indicating a large class size, NOM (Number of Methods) is 13 which is relatively high for a single class, and it has 10 dependencies suggesting high coupling. The class contains 40 decision points across 279 lines of code with 13 methods, indicating it handles too much responsibility and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
