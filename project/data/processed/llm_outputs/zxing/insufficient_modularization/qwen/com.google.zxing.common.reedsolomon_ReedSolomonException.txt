    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.ReedSolomonException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 9 lines of code (loc=9), indicating minimal complexity and size. With 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies, this is a simple exception class that is already well-modularized. The low WMC (1) and absence of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) confirm that no further decomposition is needed."
