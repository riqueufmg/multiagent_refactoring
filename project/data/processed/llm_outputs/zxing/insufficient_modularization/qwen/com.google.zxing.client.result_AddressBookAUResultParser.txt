    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (1 public) and 37 lines of code, with a low WMC of 7 indicating low complexity. The class appears to be a simple parser with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The low method count and code size suggest adequate modularization for its purpose."
