    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.OneDimensionalCodeWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods (5 public) and WMC of 18, which is manageable. The LOC is 98 which is reasonable for a code writer class. LCOM of 0.333 indicates good cohesion within the class. The class has only 1 field and 6 nested classes/dependencies, suggesting focused responsibility. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies indicate it's not heavily coupled. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
