    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6), 7 weighted method count (wmc=7), and 30 lines of code (loc=30). It has only 2 fields (nof=2) and shows good cohesion with lcom=0.0 indicating no lack of cohesion. The class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains a manageable size and complexity."
