    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 1 field (nof=1). The lines of code (loc=81) are primarily data structure definition rather than complex logic. With minimal functionality and low complexity, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for size or implementation complexity reduction."
