    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields and 0 methods, with very low complexity (wmc=0, loc=14). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or parameter object with insufficient complexity to qualify as insufficiently modularized."
