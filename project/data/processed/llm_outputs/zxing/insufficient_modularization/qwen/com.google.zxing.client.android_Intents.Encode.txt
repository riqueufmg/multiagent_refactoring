    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.Intents.Encode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 fields (nof=5), 0 methods (nom=0), 27 lines of code (loc=27), and no dependencies. The metrics indicate this is a simple data class or constant holder rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately sized and structured for its purpose."
