    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.CalendarResultHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods (nom=8) and weighted method count of 18 (wmc=18), which is within acceptable ranges. The lines of code (loc=104) is reasonable for a handler class. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low coupling (lcom=0.625, fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest proper modularization. The class appears to be well-focused on calendar result handling with appropriate method distribution."
