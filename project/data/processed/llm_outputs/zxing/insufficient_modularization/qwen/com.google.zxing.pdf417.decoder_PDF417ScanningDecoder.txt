{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (25), high lines of code (455), and a very high weighted method count (108), indicating high complexity and size. The lack of fields (0) and private fields (0) suggests potential issues with data encapsulation, while the low LCOM value (0.16) indicates cohesive methods, but the overall size and complexity metrics suggest insufficient modularization. The class likely contains too much responsibility and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more manageable classes."
