    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.MatrixToImageWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods with WMC of 13, which indicates moderate complexity. The LCOM value of 0.222 suggests good cohesion within the class. With only 111 lines of code and 8 public methods, the class is reasonably sized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low number of methods and manageable complexity metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition."
