    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.AlignmentPatternFinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 33 and LOC of 195, indicating it may contain too much responsibility. With 9 fields and 6 methods, the class appears to have significant implementation complexity that could benefit from further decomposition. The lack of public fields (nopf=0) and public methods (nopm=0) suggests internal complexity that is not well exposed, potentially indicating insufficient modularization where internal functionality could be extracted into separate components."
