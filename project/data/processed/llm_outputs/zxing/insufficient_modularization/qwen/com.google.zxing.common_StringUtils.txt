    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.StringUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 36 which is high, LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) is 0.667 indicating poor cohesion, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 198 which is substantial for a single class. With only 3 methods (nom) handling significant complexity (wmc of 36), this suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
