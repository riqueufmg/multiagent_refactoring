    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.DefaultPlacement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods with a weighted method count (WMC) of 26, indicating high complexity for a single class. The lines of code (LOC) is 153 which is relatively high for proper modularization. The class contains only 4 fields but has 14 methods, suggesting that some methods could potentially be grouped into separate cohesive units or classes to improve modularization. The lack of dependencies and low fanin/fanout suggests it could be further decomposed into more focused, smaller components."
