    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.MECARDContactEncoder.MECARDNameDisplayFormatter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 6 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and no dependencies. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and LCOM is -1.0 which suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be a simple, well-encapsulated formatter with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
