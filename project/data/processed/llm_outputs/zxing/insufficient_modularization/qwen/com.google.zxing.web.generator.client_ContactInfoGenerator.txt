    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.ContactInfoGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 46 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 20 suggesting the class has too many responsibilities, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 221 which is substantial. The class also has a low LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) value of 0.1, indicating methods are not cohesive and could be better grouped into separate classes. With 11 fields and multiple dependencies, the class handles too much functionality and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
