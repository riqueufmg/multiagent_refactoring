{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.Binarizer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (39 LOC, 7 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=7). While it has 7 methods which could potentially be decomposed, the low LCOM value (0.4285714285714285) indicates good cohesion among the methods. The class serves a specific purpose (binarization) and the method count and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
