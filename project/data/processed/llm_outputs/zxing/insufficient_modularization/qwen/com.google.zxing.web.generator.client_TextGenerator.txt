    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.TextGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (47 LOC, 8 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=11). The LCOM value of 0.375 indicates good cohesion, and the class has only 2 fields with no public fields (NC=0). The depth of inheritance is minimal (DIT=1) and there are no fan-in or fan-out dependencies, suggesting appropriate modularization for its functionality."
