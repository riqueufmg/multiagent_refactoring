    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.SMSResultHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (42 LOC) and complexity (WMC=9, NOM=6). The LCOM value of 0.833 suggests good cohesion within the class. With only 6 methods all being public (NOPM=6) and no fields (NOF=1, NOPF=0), the class appears to be well-focused on its responsibility of handling SMS results. The low complexity metrics and small size indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
