    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 5 fields (nof=5) with a low weighted method count (wmc=4), indicating low complexity. The lines of code (loc=35) are relatively small, suggesting the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
