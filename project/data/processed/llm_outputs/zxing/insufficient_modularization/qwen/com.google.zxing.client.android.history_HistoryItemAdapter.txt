    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.history.HistoryItemAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 4 weighted method complexity (wmc=4), 33 lines of code (loc=33), and only 1 field (nof=1). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity metrics, indicates the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple adapter with appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
