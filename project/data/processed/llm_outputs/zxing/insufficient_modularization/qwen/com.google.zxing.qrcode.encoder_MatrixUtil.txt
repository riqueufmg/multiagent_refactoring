    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MatrixUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 20 methods (nom) and a Weighted Methods per Class of 55 (wmc), indicating significant implementation complexity. The Lines of Code metric at 226 (loc) suggests the class is large. With 7 fields (nof) and multiple responsibilities including matrix operations, QR code encoding logic, and bit manipulation, the class violates the single responsibility principle. The high LCOM value of 0.1 indicates poor cohesion, and the numerous dependencies (6 external classes) suggest it handles too many concerns that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
