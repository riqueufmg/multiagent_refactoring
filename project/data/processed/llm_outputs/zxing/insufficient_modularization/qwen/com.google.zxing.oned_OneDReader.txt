    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.OneDReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 32 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 8 with only 4 private methods suggesting poor encapsulation, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 196 which is substantial for a single class. The class has 8 dependencies on external classes, indicating it handles multiple responsibilities. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests poor cohesion among methods, and the high NC (Number of Classes) metric of 8 indicates the class may be managing too many concerns without proper decomposition."
