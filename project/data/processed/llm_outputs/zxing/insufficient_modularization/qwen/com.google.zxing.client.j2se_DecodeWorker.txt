    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecodeWorker",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 31 which is high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 186 indicating a large class size, and it has 7 methods with only 1 being public. The class also has 13 dependencies which suggests it is handling multiple responsibilities. These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
