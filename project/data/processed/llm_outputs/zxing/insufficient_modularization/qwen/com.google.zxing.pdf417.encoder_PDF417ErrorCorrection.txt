    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 1 field (nof=1), with a moderate WMC of 14. The LOC is 77 which is relatively small. The LCOM value of 0.75 indicates good cohesion within the class. Given these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains a reasonable size and complexity level."
