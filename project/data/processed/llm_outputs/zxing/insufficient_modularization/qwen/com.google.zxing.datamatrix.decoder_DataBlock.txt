    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.DataBlock",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 2 fields (nof=2), with 67 lines of code (loc=67) and weighted method count of 13 (wmc=13). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well-decomposed. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class. The class appears to have appropriate size and complexity for its functionality, showing no evidence of insufficient modularization."
