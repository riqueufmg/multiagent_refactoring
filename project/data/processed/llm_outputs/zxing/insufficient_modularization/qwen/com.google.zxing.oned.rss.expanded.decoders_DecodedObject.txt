    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 12 lines of code (loc=12), which indicates a very small and simple class. With only 1 field (nof=1) and low complexity (wmc=2), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already appropriately small and simple."
