{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.ReaderException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 24 lines of code (loc=24), and a low weighted method count (wmc=4). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (nof=2, nc=3) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple exception class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
