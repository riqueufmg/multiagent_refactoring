    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.ProductParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5), 2 fields (nof=2), and 25 lines of code (loc=25). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=5), and there are no cycles (nc=0) or external dependencies beyond the parent class. The class appears to be well-focused with a single responsibility and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
