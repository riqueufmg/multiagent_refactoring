    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeFormatManager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 9 fields (nof=9), and a manageable size of 60 lines of code (loc=60). The weighted method count (wmc=9) indicates low method complexity. LCOM value of 0.5 suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 2 dependencies and no fan-in or fan-out, the class appears to have appropriate modularization for its functionality."
