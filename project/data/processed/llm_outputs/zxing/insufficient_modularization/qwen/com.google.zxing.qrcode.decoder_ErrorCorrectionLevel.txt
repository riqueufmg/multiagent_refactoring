    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.ErrorCorrectionLevel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 fields (nof=2), and low weighted method count (wmc=4). The lines of code (loc=35) are minimal, indicating a small and focused class. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure suggest this is a well-encapsulated, single-responsibility class that does not require further decomposition."
