    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) of 26, indicating high complexity; it contains 8 methods with 6 being public methods, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities; the LOC is 126 which is relatively high for a single class; and with DIT=1 it's not inheriting complexity from parent classes, indicating the complexity is inherent to this class design."
