    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.ErrorCorrection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 5 fields (nof=5), with a moderate WMC of 18. The LOC is 109 which is relatively small. The LCOM value of 0.667 indicates some cohesion issues but the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
