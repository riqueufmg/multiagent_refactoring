{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code93Reader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 47 and LOC of 221, indicating it may be doing too much. It has 8 methods with only 2 being public, suggesting possible internal method clustering that could be extracted. The class has 6 fields and manages multiple dependencies (7 external classes) related to barcode processing, format handling, and exception management, which indicates it might be handling too many responsibilities. The high WMC combined with substantial lines of code suggests insufficient decomposition of functionality."
