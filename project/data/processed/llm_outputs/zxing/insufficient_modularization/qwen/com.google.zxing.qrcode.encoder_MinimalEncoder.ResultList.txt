    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MinimalEncoder.ResultList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 170 lines of code (loc=170). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and low complexity metrics indicate this is likely a simple data holder or result container class that is appropriately decomposed for its purpose. The class does not exhibit characteristics of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a lightweight, focused class with minimal responsibilities."
