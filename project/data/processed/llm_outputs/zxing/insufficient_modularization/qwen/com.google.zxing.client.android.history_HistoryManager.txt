    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.history.HistoryManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) with 8 public methods (nopm=8), indicating high complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=24) suggests significant implementation complexity. With 200 lines of code (loc=200) and 9 fields (nof=9), the class combines data management, database operations, and business logic, suggesting it could be further decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
