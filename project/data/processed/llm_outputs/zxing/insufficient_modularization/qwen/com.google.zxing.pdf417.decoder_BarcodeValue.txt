{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.BarcodeValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 7 weighted method count (wmc=7), and 39 lines of code (loc=39). The lack of class dependencies (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (nof=1, nc=0) indicate proper modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class."
