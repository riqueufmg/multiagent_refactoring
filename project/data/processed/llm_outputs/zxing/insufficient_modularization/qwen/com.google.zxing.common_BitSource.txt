    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.BitSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields and 5 methods with 71 lines of code, which is relatively small. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 11, indicating moderate complexity but not excessive. The LCOM value is 0.0, suggesting good cohesion within the class. The number of methods and fields is low enough that further decomposition would likely not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity."
