{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Decoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods with a weighted method count (WMC) of 13, indicating moderate complexity. The class has 114 lines of code (LOC) which is relatively high for a single class. The class has 0 fan-in and 0 fan-out dependencies, suggesting it could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more focused components. The low LCOM value (0.2857142857142857) indicates high cohesion, but the combination of high LOC, moderate WMC, and multiple responsibilities suggests insufficient modularization."
