    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ModulusPoly",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 46 which is very high, indicating complex internal logic. The class has 13 methods (NOM) and 192 lines of code (LOC), which suggests it may be doing too much. With only 2 fields (NOF) and 1 private method (NOPM), the class appears to have a high ratio of methods to fields, suggesting potential grouping of related functionality into separate classes. The lack of inheritance (DIT=0) and low cohesion indicators suggest this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
