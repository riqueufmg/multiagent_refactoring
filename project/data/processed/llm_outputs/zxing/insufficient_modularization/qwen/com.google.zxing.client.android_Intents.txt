    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.Intents",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 38 fields which suggests it is primarily a data container or constant holder rather than a complex class requiring decomposition. The low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=1) and lack of methods (nopm=0) indicate minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from further modularization."
