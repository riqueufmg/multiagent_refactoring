{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.State",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 28 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 14 suggesting the class has too many responsibilities, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 130 which is substantial for a single class. The class also has 6 fields and depends on 3 external classes, indicating it manages multiple aspects of state and encoding logic that could be further decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
