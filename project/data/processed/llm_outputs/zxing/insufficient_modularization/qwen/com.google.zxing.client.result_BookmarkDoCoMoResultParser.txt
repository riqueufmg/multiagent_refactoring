    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=18), low weighted method count (wmc=3), and reasonable depth of inheritance (dit=2). The class appears to be focused on a single responsibility of parsing bookmark DoCoMo results and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
