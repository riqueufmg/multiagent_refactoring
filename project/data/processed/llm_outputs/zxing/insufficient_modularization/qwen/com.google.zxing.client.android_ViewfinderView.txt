    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.ViewfinderView",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods and 121 lines of code. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 15 which is relatively low. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) is 0.0 indicating good cohesion. The class has only 15 fields which is manageable. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization as the complexity and size are within reasonable limits for a viewfinder component that handles camera visualization functionality."
