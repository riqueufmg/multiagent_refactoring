{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.GeoResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 41 lines of code (loc=41), and weighted method count of 6 (wmc=6). The lack of fields (nof=1, nc=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1) indicate proper modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the single responsibility is evident from the geo parsing functionality."
