    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 9 fields and 11 lines of code. It has no methods (nom=0, wmc=0) and no dependencies to other classes except for BarcodeFormat. The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
