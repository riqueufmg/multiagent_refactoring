    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 38 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 14 which is elevated, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 245 which is substantial. The class manages multiple responsibilities including camera operations, configuration management, and preview handling as evidenced by its dependencies on AutoFocusManager, CameraConfigurationManager, OpenCameraInterface, and PreviewCallback. The high method count (14 total methods with 13 being public) and substantial code size (245 LOC) suggest this class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce implementation complexity."
