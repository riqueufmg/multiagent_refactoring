    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, 7 lines of code, and no dependencies. The WMC is 0 and DIT is 1, indicating minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or formatter with no implementation complexity that would benefit from modularization."
