{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.SMTPResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 26 lines of code (loc=26), with a low weighted method count (wmc=4). The class implements a single responsibility for parsing SMTP results and does not exhibit complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The low number of methods and manageable size indicate sufficient modularization."
