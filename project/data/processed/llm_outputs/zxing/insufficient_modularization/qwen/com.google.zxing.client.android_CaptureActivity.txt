    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 29 methods (nom) and 529 lines of code (loc), with a weighted method count (wmc) of 112, indicating high complexity and size. The lack of decomposition and high method count suggest that the class could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
