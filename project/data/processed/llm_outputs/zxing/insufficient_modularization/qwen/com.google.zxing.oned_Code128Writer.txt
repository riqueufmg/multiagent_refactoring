    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 65 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 405 indicating a large class size, and it contains 21 fields (NOF) and 8 methods (NOM). The high WMC suggests complex method implementations, while the large LOC count and significant number of fields and methods indicate the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
