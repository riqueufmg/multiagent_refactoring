{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.EmailAddressParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (60 LOC, 10 methods) and low complexity (WMC=10, DIT=1). The LCOM value of 0.3 indicates good cohesion, and the absence of fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggests simple usage patterns. While further decomposition could theoretically be possible, the current level of modularization appears sufficient given the class's relatively small size and low complexity metrics."
