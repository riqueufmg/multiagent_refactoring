{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.InactivityTimer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods and 82 lines of code, indicating moderate complexity that could benefit from further decomposition. It contains nested classes (PowerStatusReceiver and InactivityAsyncTask) which suggests functionality that could be extracted into separate modules. The presence of both receiver and async task implementations within the same class indicates mixed responsibilities that violate single responsibility principle, supporting insufficient modularization."
