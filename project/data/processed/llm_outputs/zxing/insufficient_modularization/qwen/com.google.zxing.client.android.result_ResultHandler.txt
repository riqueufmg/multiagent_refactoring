    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.ResultHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 43 methods (nom), 80 weighted method count (wmc), 361 lines of code (loc), and 13 fields (nof). The high number of methods and lines of code suggests the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
