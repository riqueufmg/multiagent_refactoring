    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.URIResultHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (50 LOC) and complexity (WMC=14, NOM=7). The LCOM value of 0.857 suggests good cohesion within the class. With only 2 fields and 7 methods, the class does not exhibit excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
