{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.PreferencesActivity",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 35 lines of code. It has 24 fields but all are public final fields (nopf=24, nof=24) which suggests they are constants or configuration values. The low method count and low cyclomatic complexity indicate the class is not overly complex in terms of behavior, and the high field count appears to be due to configuration data rather than mixed responsibilities."
