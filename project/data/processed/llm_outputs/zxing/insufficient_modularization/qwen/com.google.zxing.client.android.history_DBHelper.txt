    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3) and 24 lines of code (loc=24). The weighted method count (wmc=3) indicates simple method complexity. With only 9 fields (nof=9) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
