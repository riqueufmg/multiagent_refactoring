    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.ScanFromWebPageManager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 40 lines of code (loc=40), and a low weighted method count (wmc=4). The lack of fields (nof=9 but nopf=0 indicates no private fields) and low method count suggest reasonable modularization. No complex dependencies or high coupling metrics indicate insufficient modularization issues."
