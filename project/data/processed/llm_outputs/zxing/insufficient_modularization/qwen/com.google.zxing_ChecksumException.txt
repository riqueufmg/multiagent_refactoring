    "class": "com.google.zxing.ChecksumException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 21 lines of code (loc=21), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=4) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this is a simple exception class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
