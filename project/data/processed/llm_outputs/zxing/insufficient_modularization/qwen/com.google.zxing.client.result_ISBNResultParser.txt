    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 24 lines of code (loc=24), which indicates a very small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. The class appears to be well-decomposed and specialized for its purpose, with no indication that further decomposition would be beneficial."
