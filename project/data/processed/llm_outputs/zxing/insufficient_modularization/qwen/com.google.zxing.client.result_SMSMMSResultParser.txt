    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.SMSMMSResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (1 public) and 59 lines of code, indicating a small and focused implementation. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) is 8, which is relatively low. With only 2 methods, further decomposition would likely not improve modularity or reduce complexity significantly. The class appears to be well-focused on its specific responsibility of parsing SMS/MMS results."
