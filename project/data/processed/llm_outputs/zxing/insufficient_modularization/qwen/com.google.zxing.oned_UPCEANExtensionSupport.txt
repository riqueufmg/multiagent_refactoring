{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANExtensionSupport",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 3 fields (nof=3), and 14 lines of code (loc=14). The low number of methods and fields indicates proper modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the absence of inheritance (dit=0) and low dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate this class is appropriately decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
