    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.GeoLocationGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods and WMC of 20, but LCOM of 0.222 indicates good cohesion. With only 93 lines of code and 6 fields, the class size is reasonable. The class has low coupling with only 2 dependencies and no fanin/fanout, suggesting appropriate modularization. No clear indication that further decomposition would significantly reduce size or complexity."
