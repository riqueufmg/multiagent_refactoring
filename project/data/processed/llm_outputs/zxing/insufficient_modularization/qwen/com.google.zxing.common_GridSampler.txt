    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.GridSampler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (107 loc, 5 methods) and complexity (WMC=17) for its functionality. With only 1 field and high cohesion (LCOM=0.8), it appears to be appropriately modularized for a utility class that handles grid sampling operations with perspective transforms."
