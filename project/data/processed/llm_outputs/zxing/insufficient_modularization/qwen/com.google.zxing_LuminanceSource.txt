{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.LuminanceSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) with 11 public methods (nopm=11), 105 lines of code (loc=105), and weighted method count of 17 (wmc=17). While the class has moderate complexity, it represents a cohesive abstraction for a luminance source with getter methods, cropping, inversion, and rendering functionality. The LCOM value of 0.583 suggests reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be well-bounded in responsibility and does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
