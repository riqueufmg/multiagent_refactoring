    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.TelParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 3 fields (nof=3), with low complexity (wmc=5, loc=30). The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and minimal dependencies indicate it is already well-decomposed. The class represents a simple data structure for telephone parsing results, which is appropriately sized for its purpose."
