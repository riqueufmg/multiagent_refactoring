    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.HTTPSFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1) and 17 lines of code (loc=17), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no nested classes (nc=0), the class is already sufficiently modularized for its size and functionality. No further decomposition would provide meaningful benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity."
