    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.AddressBookDoCoMoResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (1 public) and 36 lines of code, indicating a small and focused implementation. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) is 6, which is relatively low. The class appears to be well-modularized with a single responsibility for parsing AddressBook DoCoMo results, and there is no evidence of incomplete decomposition or excessive complexity that would warrant further breakdown."
