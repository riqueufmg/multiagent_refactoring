    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.detector.WhiteRectangleDetector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 41 and LOC of 219, indicating it may contain too much responsibility. It has 6 methods with only 3 being public, suggesting potential for better decomposition. The class has 9 fields which may indicate multiple responsibilities. The high WMC value suggests complex method implementations that could benefit from further modularization into smaller, more focused classes."
