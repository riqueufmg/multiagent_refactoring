    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.BlockParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 21 lines of code (loc=21), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains good encapsulation. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest proper separation of concerns. The class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
