    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom), 17 lines of code (loc), and a low weighted method count (wmc) of 5. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (lcom=0.8) suggest it is already well modularized. The small size and simple structure indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
