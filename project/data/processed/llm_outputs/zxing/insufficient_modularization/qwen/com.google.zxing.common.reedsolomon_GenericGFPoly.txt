    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.GenericGFPoly",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 12 methods (nom) and a weighted method count of 49 (wmc), indicating significant implementation complexity. With only 2 fields (nof) and 220 lines of code (loc), the class implements substantial functionality that could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low cohesion indicators suggest this class may be doing too much and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and complexity."
