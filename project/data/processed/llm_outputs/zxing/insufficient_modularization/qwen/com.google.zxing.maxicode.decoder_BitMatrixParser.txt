    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 29 lines of code (loc=29), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
