    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.BarcodeMatrix",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (43 LOC) and complexity (WMC=8) with only 6 methods. While it has some functional cohesion (4 fields, 6 methods), the metrics do not indicate excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the low number of methods and fields indicate it is already reasonably well modularized."
