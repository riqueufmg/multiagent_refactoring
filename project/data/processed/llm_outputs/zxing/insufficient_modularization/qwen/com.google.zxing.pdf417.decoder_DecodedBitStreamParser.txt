    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 115 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 479 indicating a large class size, and it has 30 fields (nof) with no public fields, suggesting high internal complexity. The class contains multiple responsibilities as indicated by the high WMC and large size, which could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce implementation complexity."
