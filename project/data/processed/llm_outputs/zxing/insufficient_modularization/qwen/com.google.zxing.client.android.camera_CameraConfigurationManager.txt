    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraConfigurationManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 30 and 12 methods, indicating it may be doing too much. The LOC is 156 which is relatively high for a single class, suggesting it could benefit from decomposition. The class has 8 fields and 12 methods with low LCOM of 0.167, indicating methods are likely cohesive but the overall class size and complexity suggest insufficient modularization. The class manages camera configuration responsibilities which could be further decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
