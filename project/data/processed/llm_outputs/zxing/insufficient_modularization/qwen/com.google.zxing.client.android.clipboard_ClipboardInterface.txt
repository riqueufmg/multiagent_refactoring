    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard.ClipboardInterface",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 31 lines of code (loc=31), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 0.4 lack of cohesion (lcom=0.4), the class appears to be well-focused and cohesive. The absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's isolated but not necessarily insufficiently modularized. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition."
