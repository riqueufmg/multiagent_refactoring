    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code93Writer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high Weighted Method Complexity (WMC=27) with only 6 methods, indicating complex method implementations. The Lines of Code (LOC=127) is relatively high for a class with few methods, suggesting methods are doing too much work. The lack of fields (NOF=0) and low method count (NOM=6) indicate poor decomposition of functionality. The class likely contains methods with high cyclomatic complexity that could be further decomposed into smaller, more manageable methods to reduce implementation complexity."
