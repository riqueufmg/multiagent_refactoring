    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.FinishListener",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 19 lines of code (loc=19), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
