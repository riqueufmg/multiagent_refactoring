    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecDetectorResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6, wmc=6) and 32 lines of code (loc=32). It has a clean design with no code smells indicated by lcom=0.0 (perfect cohesion). The class appears to be well-focused with only 4 fields and no public fields (nopf=0). The low method count and high cohesion suggest appropriate modularization rather than insufficient decomposition."
