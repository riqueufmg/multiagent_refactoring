    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.QRCodeMultiReader.SAComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 7 lines of code, no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), and no dependencies on other classes except for ResultMetadataType enum. The low size and complexity metrics indicate sufficient modularization for this comparator implementation."
