    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.EAN8Writer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 1 private method (nopm=1), 1 field (nof=1), and 52 lines of code (loc=52). The weighted method count is low (wmc=7) and the lack of complexity (nc=0) indicates proper modularization. The class follows single responsibility principle by focusing on EAN8 barcode writing functionality."
