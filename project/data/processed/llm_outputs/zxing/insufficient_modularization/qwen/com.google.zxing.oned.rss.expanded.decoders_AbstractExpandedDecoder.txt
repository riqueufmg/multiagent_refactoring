    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=19, NOM=5, LOC=49) and a reasonable number of fields (NOF=2). The LCOM value of 0.4 indicates good cohesion within the class. With only 2 public methods and 5 total methods, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
