{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector.MultiFinderPatternFinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high Weighted Method Count (WMC=30) and Lines of Code (LOC=163) with only 3 methods, indicating high implementation complexity that could benefit from further decomposition. The high WMC suggests complex method implementations, while the low method count relative to LOC indicates methods are likely doing too much work. The class also has 7 fields and complex dependencies with 7 external classes, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
