    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 3 fields (nof=3), and 43 lines of code (loc=43). The weighted method count (wmc=7) indicates low behavioral complexity. With only 4 methods and no complex dependencies, the class is already sufficiently modularized for its size and functionality."
