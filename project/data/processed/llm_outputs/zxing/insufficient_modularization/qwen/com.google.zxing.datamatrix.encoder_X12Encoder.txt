{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.X12Encoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 2 public), low lines of code (58), and reasonable weighted method count (15). The depth of inheritance (2) is minimal. While LCOM is -1.0 which may indicate some cohesion issues, the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization - the class appears appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
