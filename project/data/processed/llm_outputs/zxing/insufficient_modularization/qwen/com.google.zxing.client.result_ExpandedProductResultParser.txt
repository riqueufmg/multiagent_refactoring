    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.ExpandedProductResultParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high Weighted Method Complexity (WMC = 49) with only 3 methods, indicating complex implementations. The Lines of Code (LOC = 111) is relatively high for such a small number of methods, suggesting methods are doing too much work. The high WMC to method ratio (49/3 ≈ 16.3) indicates insufficient decomposition of functionality. LCOM value of -1.0 suggests poor cohesion, and the class has high implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition."
