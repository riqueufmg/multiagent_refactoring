    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods and WMC of 19, but does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization. The LCOM value of 0.57 suggests reasonable cohesion, and with only 96 lines of code, the class size is manageable. The method count and complexity metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition."
