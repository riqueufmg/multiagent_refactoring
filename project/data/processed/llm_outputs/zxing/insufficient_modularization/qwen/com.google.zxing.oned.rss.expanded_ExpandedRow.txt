    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.ExpandedRow",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (36 LOC) and complexity (WMC=8, NOM=7). The low number of fields (NOF=2) and methods (NOM=7) indicates proper decomposition. LCOM=0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class. The absence of dependencies and low complexity metrics indicate this class is well-modularized and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
