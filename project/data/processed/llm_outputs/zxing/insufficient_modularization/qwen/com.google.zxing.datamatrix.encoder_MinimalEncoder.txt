    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.MinimalEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods with a total of 614 lines of code and a weighted method count (WMC) of 41, indicating high implementation complexity. The class contains multiple inner classes (Result, Input, Edge, Mode) suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. With only 2 public methods out of 13 total methods, there's a high ratio of private/protected methods that could potentially be grouped into separate cohesive modules. The low LCOM value (0.307) indicates good cohesion, but the overall size and complexity still suggest insufficient modularization as the class could be further decomposed to reduce its size and complexity."
