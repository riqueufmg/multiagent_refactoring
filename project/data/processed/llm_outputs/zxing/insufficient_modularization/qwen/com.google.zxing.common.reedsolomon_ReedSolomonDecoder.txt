    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.ReedSolomonDecoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 25 and LOC of 137, indicating substantial implementation complexity. It contains 6 methods with only 3 being public, suggesting potential for further decomposition. The class has 0 fanin and fanout, indicating it could be better modularized to improve cohesion and reduce complexity. The high WMC relative to the number of methods (6) suggests individual methods may be complex and the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused components."
