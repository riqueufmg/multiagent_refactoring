    "class": "com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 95 lines of code (loc=95), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=13) suggests low complexity. The lack of class dependencies (dit=0, nc=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate good modularization. The class appears to be well-focused with a single responsibility related to binary bitmap operations."
