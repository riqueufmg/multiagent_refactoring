    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 2 public methods (nopm=2), with very low complexity (wmc=3) and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The lack of fields (nof=0) and simple method count indicate this is already a well-decomposed, focused class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
