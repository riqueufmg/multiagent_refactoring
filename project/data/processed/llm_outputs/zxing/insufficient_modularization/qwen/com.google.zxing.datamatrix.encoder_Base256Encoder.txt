    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.Base256Encoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 49 lines of code (loc=49), and weighted method count of 10 (wmc=10). The lack of fields (nof=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a small, focused encoder implementation with appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
