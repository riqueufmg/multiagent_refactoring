{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.GeoParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods (nom=7) and 11 weighted method count (wmc=11), 74 lines of code (loc=74) which is reasonable for a parsed result class. The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1) suggest it's already well-decomposed. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the low number of fields (nof=4) supports that this class is sufficiently modularized."
