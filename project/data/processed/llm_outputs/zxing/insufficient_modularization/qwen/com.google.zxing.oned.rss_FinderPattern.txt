{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.FinderPattern",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6), low lines of code (32), and low weighted method count (7). The lack of fields (0) and the fact that all methods are public (6 out of 6) suggest a simple, well-focused class. The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized and decomposed."
