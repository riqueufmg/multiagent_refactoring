    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.ViewfinderResultPointCallback",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 9 lines of code (loc=9), which indicates a very small and focused implementation. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 2 dependencies, the class maintains a clear and simple responsibility. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
