    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.AutoFocusManager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods (1 private) and 8 fields, totaling 85 lines of code. The WMC of 12 indicates manageable complexity. The class has 2 dependencies but no fan-in or fan-out metrics suggesting limited external coupling. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the current metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant classification as Insufficient Modularization. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class."
