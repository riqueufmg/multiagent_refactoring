    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.ResultParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 43 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 16 suggesting the class has too many responsibilities, LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) is 0.5625 indicating moderate lack of cohesion, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 184 which is substantial for a single class. These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
