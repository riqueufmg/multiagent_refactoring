    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.Formatter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 12 lines of code (loc=12), and 5 nested classes (nc=5). While the nested class count is relatively high for the small size, the low method count and complexity indicate sufficient modularization. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies suggest limited responsibility scope."
