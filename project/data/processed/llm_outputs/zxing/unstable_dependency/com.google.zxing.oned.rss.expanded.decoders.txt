"package": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has Ce=3, Ca=1 => instability I = 3/(1+3) = 0.75. Its outgoing dependencies: com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36 => I ≈ 0.0526) and com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29 => I ≈ 0.0333) are more stable (lower I) — these are acceptable. However it also depends on com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded (Ce=7, Ca=1 => I = 7/(1+7) = 0.875), which is less stable (higher I) than com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle. Additionally, com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded lists com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders as an incoming dependency (cyclic dependency), which increases instability risk. Therefore an unstable dependency smell is detected."
