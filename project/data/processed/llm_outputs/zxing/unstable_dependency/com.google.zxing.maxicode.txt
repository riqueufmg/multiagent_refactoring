"justification": "Analyzed package has Ce=3 and Ca=0 (Instability I = 0.0). Its outgoing dependencies have higher stability: com.google.zxing (Ca=36, Ce=2, I≈0.947), com.google.zxing.common (Ca=29, Ce=1, I≈0.967), com.google.zxing.maxicode.decoder (Ca=1, Ce=3, I=0.25). All dependency packages have greater instability index (I) than the analyzed package, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated and no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
