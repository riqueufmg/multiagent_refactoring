Outgoing dependencies instabilities: com.google.zxing I=2/(36+2)=0.0526, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder I=3/(4+3)=0.4286, com.google.zxing.common I=1/(29+1)=0.0333, com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder I=4/(2+4)=0.6667. All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than com.google.zxing.qrcode, so the package does not depend on less stable components and does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
