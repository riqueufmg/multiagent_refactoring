"justification": "Analyzed package has Ce=3 and Ca=1 → instability I = 1/(1+3) = 0.25 (relatively unstable). Its outgoing dependencies are more stable: com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36 → I = 36/38 ≈ 0.947), com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon (Ce=0, Ca=8 → I = 8/8 = 1.0), com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29 → I = 29/30 ≈ 0.967). Incoming package com.google.zxing.maxicode is even more unstable (Ce=3, Ca=0 → I = 0), and depends on this package. Because the analyzed package depends only on packages with substantially higher stability indices, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle — no unstable-dependency smell detected."
