Outgoing dependencies and their instabilities: com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29 -> I=0.033), com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon (Ce=0, Ca=8 -> I=0.000), com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder (Ce=3, Ca=4 -> I=0.429), com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36 -> I=0.053). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (more stable) than com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder (0.667 > 0.429, 0.053, 0.033, 0.000). Therefore the package does not depend on less stable components and does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
