"justification": "Analyzed package has Ce=3, Ca=0 => instability I = 3/(3+0) = 1.0 (maximally unstable). Outgoing dependencies are: com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard (Ce=0, Ca=2, I=0.0), com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36, I≈0.0526), com.google.zxing.client.android (Ce=6, Ca=7, I≈0.4615). All outgoing packages have lower instability (smaller I) than the analyzed package, so the package does not depend on less stable components. Although the package has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0) making it highly unstable in isolation, it respects the Stable Dependencies Principle with respect to its outgoing dependencies; therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
