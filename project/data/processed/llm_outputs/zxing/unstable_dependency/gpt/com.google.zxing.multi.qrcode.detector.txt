Outgoing dependencies and their stabilities: com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector (Ce=4, Ca=1 => I=1/(1+4)=0.2), com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29 => I=29/(29+1)=0.9667), com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36 => I=36/(36+2)=0.9474). All outgoing dependencies have higher stability (0.2, 0.9667, 0.9474) than the analyzed package (0), and there are no incoming dependencies. Therefore the package does not depend on less stable components and the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
