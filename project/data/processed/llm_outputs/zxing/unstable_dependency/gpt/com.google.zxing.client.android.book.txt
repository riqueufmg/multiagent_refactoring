"justification": "com.google.zxing.client.android.book has Ce=1 and Ca=0 -> Instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 1.0 (very unstable). It has a single outgoing dependency to com.google.zxing.client.android which has Ce=6 and Ca=7 -> Instability I = 6/(6+7) ≈ 0.462. Because the dependency's instability (≈0.462) is lower than the analyzed package's instability (1.0), the dependency is directed toward a more stable package, complying with the Stable Dependencies Principle. No unstable dependency smell detected."
