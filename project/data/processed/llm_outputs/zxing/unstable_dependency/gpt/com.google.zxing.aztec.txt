"justification": "com.google.zxing.aztec has Ce=4 and Ca=3 (stability = 3/(3+4) = 0.429). It depends on com.google.zxing (stability = 36/(36+2) = 0.947) and com.google.zxing.common (stability = 29/(29+1) = 0.967) which are more stable (acceptable), but it also depends on com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder (Ce=5, Ca=3, stability = 3/(3+5) = 0.375) and com.google.zxing.aztec.detector (Ce=6, Ca=1, stability = 1/(1+6) = 0.143), both of which are less stable than com.google.zxing.aztec. Those outgoing dependencies to less-stable packages violate the Stable Dependencies Principle, therefore an Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
