"justification": "Computed instability of analyzed package = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 3/(1+3) = 0.75. Outgoing dependencies have instabilities: com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon = 0/(8+0) = 0.0, com.google.zxing = 2/(36+2) ≈ 0.0526, com.google.zxing.common = 1/(29+1) ≈ 0.0333. All outgoing dependencies are significantly more stable (lower instability) than the analyzed package, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected. (Incoming package com.google.zxing.datamatrix has instability 5/(0+5)=1.0 but it is an incoming dependency and does not create an unstable dependency from the analyzed package to less stable packages.)"
