"justification": "The package has Ce=0 and no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty), so it does not depend on any other packages; incoming_dependencies is also empty (Ca=0). Because it has no efferent couplings, there is no dependency on less-stable packages and therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
