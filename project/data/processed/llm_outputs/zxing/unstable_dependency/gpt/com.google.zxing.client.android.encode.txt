"justification": "Analyzed package has Ce=4, Ca=0 (instability I = 4/(4+0) = 1.00) and no incoming dependencies (leaf). All outgoing dependencies are more stable: com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36, I=0.0526), com.google.zxing.client.android (Ce=6, Ca=7, I=0.4615), com.google.zxing.client.result (Ce=2, Ca=6, I=0.25), com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29, I=0.0333). Since the package depends only on components with lower instability (more stable) than itself and has no incoming dependencies violating the direction of stability, the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
