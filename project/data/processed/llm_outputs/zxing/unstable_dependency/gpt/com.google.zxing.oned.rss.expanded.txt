Outgoing dependencies and their instabilities: com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders (Ce=3, Ca=1 -> I=0.75), com.google.zxing.client.result (Ce=2, Ca=6 -> I=0.25), com.google.zxing.common.detector (Ce=2, Ca=8 -> I=0.20), com.google.zxing.oned (Ce=2, Ca=2 -> I=0.50), com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36 -> I≈0.053), com.google.zxing.oned.rss (Ce=3, Ca=1 -> I=0.75), com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29 -> I≈0.033). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than the analyzed package, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated. There is a mutual dependency with com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders, but that package's instability (0.75) is still lower than 0.875, therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
