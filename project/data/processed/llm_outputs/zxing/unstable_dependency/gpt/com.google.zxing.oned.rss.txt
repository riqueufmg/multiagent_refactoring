"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=3, Ca=1 => Instability I = 3/(1+3) = 0.75. Outgoing dependencies: com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36 => I≈0.053), com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29 => I≈0.033), com.google.zxing.common.detector (Ce=2, Ca=8 => I=0.20). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than com.google.zxing.oned.rss, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and there is no unstable dependency. Incoming dependency com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded (Ce=7, Ca=1 => I=0.875) depends on this package, but that does not make com.google.zxing.oned.rss depend on less stable components."
