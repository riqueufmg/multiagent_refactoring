"justification": "com.google.zxing.pdf417 has Ce=7 and Ca=2 (instability I = 7/(7+2) ≈ 0.78). One of its outgoing dependencies is com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder (Ce=6, Ca=1, I = 6/(6+1) ≈ 0.86), which is less stable (higher I) than com.google.zxing.pdf417. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle (a package should only depend on packages more stable than itself). Additionally, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder appears in both outgoing and incoming dependency lists (mutual/cyclic dependency), reinforcing the unstable dependency architecture. Therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
