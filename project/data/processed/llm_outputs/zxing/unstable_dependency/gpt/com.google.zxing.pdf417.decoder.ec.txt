"package": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The analyzed package has Ce=3, Ca=1 => instability I = 3/(3+1) = 0.75. Among its outgoing dependencies, com.google.zxing.pdf417 has Ce=7, Ca=2 => I = 7/(7+2) ≈ 0.778, which is more unstable than the analyzed package (0.778 > 0.75). This means the package depends on a less stable package (violation of Stable Dependencies Principle). The other outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing I ≈ 0.053, com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon I = 0.0) are more stable, but the presence of the dependency on com.google.zxing.pdf417 constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell."
