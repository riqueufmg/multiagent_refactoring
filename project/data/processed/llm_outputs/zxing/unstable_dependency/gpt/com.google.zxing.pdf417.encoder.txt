"justification": "Analyzed package com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder has Ce=2, Ca=2 => instability I=2/(2+2)=0.50. Its outgoing dependencies are com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36 => I=36/38≈0.95) and com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29 => I=29/30≈0.97). Both outgoing dependencies are substantially more stable than the analyzed package, so dependencies point toward more stable packages (follows the Stable Dependencies Principle). Incoming dependents (com.google.zxing.pdf417: Ce=7, Ca=2 => I≈0.22; com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder: Ce=6, Ca=1 => I≈0.14) are less stable, which is consistent with correct dependency direction. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
