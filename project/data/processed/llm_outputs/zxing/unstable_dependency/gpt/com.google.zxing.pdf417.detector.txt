"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=2, Ca=1 -> Instability I = 2/(2+1) = 0.667. Outgoing dependencies: com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36 -> I = 2/(2+36) = 0.053) and com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29 -> I = 1/(1+29) = 0.033). Both outgoing packages have substantially lower instability (more stable) than the analyzed package, so the package does not depend on less stable components. Incoming dependency com.google.zxing.pdf417 (Ce=7, Ca=2 -> I = 0.778) is more unstable, but as an incoming dependency it does not indicate the analyzed package depends on a less stable package. Therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
