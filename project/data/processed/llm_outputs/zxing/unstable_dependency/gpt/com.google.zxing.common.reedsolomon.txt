"justification": "com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon has Ce=0 and Ca=8 (instability I = 0/(8+0) = 0) and has no outgoing dependencies. It does not depend on any other packages (outgoing_dependencies = []), while eight packages depend on it (com.google.zxing.maxicode.decoder, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder, com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder, com.google.zxing.aztec.detector, com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder, com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder). Because it is highly stable (I=0) and has no unstable outgoing dependencies, the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
