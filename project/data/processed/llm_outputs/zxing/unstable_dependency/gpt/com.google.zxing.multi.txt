"package": "com.google.zxing.multi",
"detection": false,
"justification": "com.google.zxing.multi has Ce=2, Ca=4 -> instability I=2/(2+4)=0.333. Its outgoing dependencies are com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36 -> I=2/38≈0.053) and com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29 -> I=1/30≈0.033). Both outgoing packages are more stable (lower I) than com.google.zxing.multi, so dependencies point toward more stable packages and comply with the Stable Dependencies Principle. Incoming dependents (com.google.zxing.client.j2se I=4/(4+1)=0.8, com.google.zxing.web I=1.0, com.google.zxing.pdf417 I=7/(7+2)≈0.778, com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode I=1.0) are less stable and depend on this package, which is appropriate. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
