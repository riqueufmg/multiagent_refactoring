Outgoing dependencies and their instabilities: com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder (Ce=3, Ca=1 -> I=0.75), com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder (Ce=4, Ca=2 -> I≈0.667), com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36 -> I≈0.053), com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29 -> I≈0.033), com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder (Ce=1, Ca=1 -> I=0.5). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than the analyzed package, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated. There are no incoming dependencies (Ca=0) that would indicate the package is relied upon by less stable packages. Therefore, no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
