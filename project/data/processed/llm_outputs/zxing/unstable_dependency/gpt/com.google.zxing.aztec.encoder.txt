"package": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder",
"detection": true,
"justification": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder has Ca=3, Ce=5 (stability I = 3/(3+5) = 0.375). It has an outgoing dependency to com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder which has Ca=1, Ce=5 (stability I = 1/(1+5) = 0.167), which is less stable than the analyzed package and therefore violates the Stable Dependencies Principle. Other outgoing dependencies are more stable (com.google.zxing.aztec I≈0.429, com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon I=1.0, com.google.zxing I≈0.947, com.google.zxing.common I≈0.967). Incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.aztec, com.google.zxing.aztec.detector, com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder) do not eliminate the unstable outgoing dependency."
