"justification": "The package has Ce=0 (no outgoing dependencies) and Ca=2 (incoming from com.google.zxing.client.android and com.google.zxing.client.android.share). Since it does not depend on any other packages (outgoing_dependencies empty) it cannot be depending on less-stable components, therefore it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle and no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
