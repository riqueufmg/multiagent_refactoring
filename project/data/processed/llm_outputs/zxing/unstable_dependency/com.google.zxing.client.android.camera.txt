"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=2, Ca=1 => Instability I=2/(1+2)=0.667. Outgoing dependencies: com.google.zxing.client.android (Ce=6, Ca=7 => I=6/(6+7)=0.462), com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open (Ce=0, Ca=1 => I=0/(0+1)=0.0). Both outgoing dependencies have lower instability (more stable) than the analyzed package (0.462 and 0.0 < 0.667), so the package does not depend on less stable components. Incoming dependency: com.google.zxing.client.android depends on this package (consistent with its lower instability). Therefore, the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated and no unstable dependency smell is detected."
