"justification": "Analyzed package com.google.zxing.client.j2se has Ce=4, Ca=1 (instability I = 4/(4+1) = 0.80). Outgoing dependencies: com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36, I ≈ 0.053), com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29, I ≈ 0.033), com.google.zxing.client.result (Ce=2, Ca=6, I = 0.25), com.google.zxing.multi (Ce=2, Ca=4, I ≈ 0.33). All outgoing dependencies have substantially lower instability (are more stable) than the analyzed package, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated and there is no Unstable Dependency smell. Incoming dependency com.google.zxing.web (Ce=5, Ca=0, I = 1.0) is more unstable, but it is an incoming dependency and does not cause this package to depend on less stable components."
