Outgoing dependencies: com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36 -> I=0.947), com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29 -> I=0.967), com.google.zxing.multi (Ce=2, Ca=4 -> I=0.667). All outgoing dependencies have higher stability indices than com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode, so the package does not depend on less stable components. Incoming dependencies = 0 (Ca=0) does not create an unstable-dependency violation in this case. Therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
