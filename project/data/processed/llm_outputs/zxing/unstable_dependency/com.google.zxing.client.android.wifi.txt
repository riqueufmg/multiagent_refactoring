"justification": "Analyzed package com.google.zxing.client.android.wifi has Ce=1 and Ca=0 (instability I = 0/(0+1) = 0.0 — very unstable). It has one outgoing dependency: com.google.zxing.client.result (Ce=2, Ca=6, instability I = 6/(6+2) = 0.75 — more stable). There are no incoming dependencies. Because the package depends on a more stable package (dependency direction follows the Stable Dependencies Principle), the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
