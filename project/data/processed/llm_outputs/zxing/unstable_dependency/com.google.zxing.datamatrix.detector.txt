"justification": "The analyzed package has Ce=3, Ca=0 -> Instability I = 3/(0+3) = 1.0 (highly unstable). Its outgoing dependencies are: com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36 -> I = 2/38 ≈ 0.0526), com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29 -> I = 1/30 ≈ 0.0333), and com.google.zxing.common.detector (Ce=2, Ca=8 -> I = 2/10 = 0.2). All target packages have lower instability values (are more stable) than the analyzed package, and incoming dependencies for the analyzed package are empty (Ca=0). Because the package depends on more stable packages rather than less stable ones, the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated and there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
