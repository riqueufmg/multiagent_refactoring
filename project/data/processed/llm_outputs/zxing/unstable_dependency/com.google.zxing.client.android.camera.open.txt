"package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has Ce=0 (no outgoing dependencies) and Ca=1 (one incoming dependency), giving instability I = 0/(0+1) = 0 (fully stable). There are no outgoing dependencies to less stable packages, so it does not depend on any less stable component. Although it is depended on by com.google.zxing.client.android.camera (which has Ce=2, Ca=1, I ≈ 0.67 and is less stable), that incoming dependency does not constitute an Unstable Dependency for the analyzed package. Therefore no unstable dependency smell is detected."
