"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ca=1, Ce=4 -> instability I=1/(1+4)=0.20 (relatively unstable). Outgoing dependencies and their instability: com.google.zxing (Ca=36, Ce=2 -> I=36/38=0.95), com.google.zxing.common (Ca=29, Ce=1 -> I=29/30=0.97), com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder (Ca=4, Ce=3 -> I=4/7=0.57), com.google.zxing.common.detector (Ca=8, Ce=2 -> I=8/10=0.80). All outgoing dependencies have higher stability (larger I) than com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector, so the package depends on more stable packages and does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
