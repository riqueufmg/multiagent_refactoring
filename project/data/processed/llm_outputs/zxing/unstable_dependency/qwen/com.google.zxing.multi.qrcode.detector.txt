"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector has outgoing dependencies on com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector, com.google.zxing.common, and com.google.zxing. To evaluate stability, we consider the instability metric (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)). The analyzed package has Ce=3 and Ca=0, giving it an instability of 1.0 (maximally unstable). The dependencies have the following instabilities: com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector (Ce=4, Ca=1, I=0.8), com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29, I=0.03), and com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36, I=0.05). All dependencies are more stable (lower instability) than the analyzed package, which complies with the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
