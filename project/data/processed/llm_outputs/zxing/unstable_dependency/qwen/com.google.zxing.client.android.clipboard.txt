"justification": "This package has no outgoing dependencies (Ce=0), making it maximally stable (I=1.0). It is depended upon by two other packages: com.google.zxing.client.android (which has Ce=6, Ca=7, I=0.46) and com.google.zxing.client.android.share (which has Ce=3, Ca=0, I=1.0). Since this package is maximally stable and its dependents have lower or equal stability, there is no unstable dependency smell."
