"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder has outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing and com.google.zxing.common. The stability metric (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)) for com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder is 0.5, for com.google.zxing is approximately 0.053, and for com.google.zxing.common is approximately 0.033. Since the dependencies are directed towards more stable packages (lower instability values), this adheres to the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not constitute an Unstable Dependency smell."
