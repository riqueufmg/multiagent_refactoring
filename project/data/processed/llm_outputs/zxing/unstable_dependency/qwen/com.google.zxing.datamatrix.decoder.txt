"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder has outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon, com.google.zxing.common, and com.google.zxing. To evaluate stability, we calculate the instability (I) metric as Ce/(Ce+Ca) where Ce is efferent couplings and Ca is afferent couplings. For com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder: I = 3/(3+1) = 0.75. For its dependencies: com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon has I = 0/(0+8) = 0 (more stable), com.google.zxing.common has I = 1/(1+29) = 0.033 (more stable), and com.google.zxing has I = 2/(2+36) = 0.053 (more stable). Since all dependencies are more stable than the analyzed package, this does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
