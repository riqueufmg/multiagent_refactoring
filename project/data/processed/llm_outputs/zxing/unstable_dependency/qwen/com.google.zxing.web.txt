"justification": "The package 'com.google.zxing.web' has outgoing dependencies on packages that are more stable (higher Ca, lower Ce). 'com.google.zxing.common' has Ca=29 and Ce=1, 'com.google.zxing' has Ca=36 and Ce=2, indicating high stability. The other dependencies also point to relatively more stable packages based on their Ca/Ce ratios. Therefore, it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle."
