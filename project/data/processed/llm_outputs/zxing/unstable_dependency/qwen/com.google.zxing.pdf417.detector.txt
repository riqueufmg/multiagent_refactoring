The stability metric (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)) for com.google.zxing.pdf417.detector is 0.67 (Ce=2, Ca=1), for com.google.zxing.common is 0.03 (Ce=1, Ca=29), and for com.google.zxing is 0.05 (Ce=2, Ca=36). Since the detector package depends on packages that are more stable (lower instability values) than itself, it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
