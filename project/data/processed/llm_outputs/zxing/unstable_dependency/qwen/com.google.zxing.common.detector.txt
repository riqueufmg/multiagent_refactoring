"package": "com.google.zxing.common.detector",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.google.zxing.common.detector' has outgoing dependencies to 'com.google.zxing.common' and 'com.google.zxing'. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we must evaluate the stability of these dependencies relative to the source package. Stability is calculated as Instability (I) = Ce / (Ca + Ce), where Ce is efferent couplings (outgoing dependencies) and Ca is afferent couplings (incoming dependencies). For 'com.google.zxing.common.detector', I = 2 / (8 + 2) = 0.2. For 'com.google.zxing.common', I = 1 / (29 + 1) = 0.033. For 'com.google.zxing', I = 2 / (36 + 2) = 0.053. Both dependencies have lower instability values (more stable) than the source package (0.2), which means the dependencies are in the correct direction according to the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
