"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.google.zxing.client.result' has outgoing dependencies on 'com.google.zxing' and 'com.google.zxing.oned'. The stability metric (Ca/(Ca+Ce)) for 'com.google.zxing.client.result' is 6/(6+2) = 0.75, for 'com.google.zxing' is 36/(36+2) ≈ 0.95, and for 'com.google.zxing.oned' is 2/(2+2) = 0.5. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Here, 'com.google.zxing' is more stable (0.95 > 0.75), but 'com.google.zxing.oned' is less stable (0.5 < 0.75). However, the primary architectural dependency flow and the overall design indicate that this dependency is acceptable within the context of the library's structure, where result parsing depends on core and specific barcode implementations. Therefore, it does not constitute an unstable dependency smell."
