"package": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder",

"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder has outgoing dependency to com.google.zxing which has higher stability (Ca=36, Ce=2) compared to this package (Ca=1, Ce=1). The incoming dependency from com.google.zxing.datamatrix shows that less stable packages depend on this package, which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle. This package depends on a more stable package, so there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
