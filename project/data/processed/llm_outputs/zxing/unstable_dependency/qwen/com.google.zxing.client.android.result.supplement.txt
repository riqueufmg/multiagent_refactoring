"package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has an instability value of 0.75 (Ce=3, Ca=1, I=Ce/(Ca+Ce)=3/4=0.75). Its outgoing dependencies are com.google.zxing.client.android (I=6/13≈0.46), com.google.zxing.client.result (I=2/8=0.25), and com.google.zxing.client.android.history (I=3/5=0.6). All these dependencies have lower instability values than the analyzed package, meaning it depends on more stable packages. This complies with the Stable Dependencies Principle."
