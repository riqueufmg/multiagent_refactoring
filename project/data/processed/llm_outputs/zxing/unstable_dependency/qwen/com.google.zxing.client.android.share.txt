"package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.share",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.google.zxing.client.android.share' has outgoing dependencies to 'com.google.zxing.client.android', 'com.google.zxing', and 'com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard'. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we need to compare the stability (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)) of the analyzed package with its dependencies. The analyzed package has Ce=3 and Ca=0, giving it an instability of 1.0 (completely unstable). The dependency 'com.google.zxing.client.android' has Ce=6 and Ca=7, giving it an instability of 0.46. The dependency 'com.google.zxing' has Ce=2 and Ca=36, giving it an instability of 0.05. The dependency 'com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard' has Ce=0 and Ca=2, giving it an instability of 0.0. Since the analyzed package (instability=1.0) depends on packages that are more stable (instability<1.0), this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and is not an unstable dependency."
