"package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.client.android.result has outgoing dependencies on com.google.zxing.client.android, com.google.zxing.client.result, and com.google.zxing. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we need to calculate stability (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)) for each package. com.google.zxing.client.android.result has I = 3/(2+3) = 0.6. com.google.zxing.client.android has I = 6/(7+6) = 0.46, com.google.zxing.client.result has I = 2/(6+2) = 0.25, and com.google.zxing has I = 2/(36+2) = 0.05. Since com.google.zxing.client.android.result (I=0.6) depends on packages that are more stable (lower I values), this does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
