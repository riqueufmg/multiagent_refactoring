"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode has outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing.multi, com.google.zxing, and com.google.zxing.common. To evaluate stability, we calculate the instability (I) metric as Ce/(Ca+Ce). For com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode: I = 3/(0+3) = 1.0 (completely unstable). For its dependencies: com.google.zxing.multi has I = 2/(4+2) = 0.33, com.google.zxing has I = 2/(36+2) = 0.05, and com.google.zxing.common has I = 1/(29+1) = 0.03. Since the analyzed package is unstable (I=1.0) and depends on packages that are more stable (lower I values), it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
