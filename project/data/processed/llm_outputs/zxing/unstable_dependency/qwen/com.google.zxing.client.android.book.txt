"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.client.android.book has stability of 1.0 (Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 1/(0+1) = 1.0) and depends on com.google.zxing.client.android which has stability of 0.46 (Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 6/(7+6) = 0.46). Since the dependent package is less stable than the source package, this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not constitute an Unstable Dependency smell."
