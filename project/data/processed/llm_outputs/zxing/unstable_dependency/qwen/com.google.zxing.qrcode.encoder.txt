"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder has a stability value of 0.27 (Ce=4, Ca=2). Its outgoing dependencies include com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon (stability=0), com.google.zxing.common (stability=0.03), com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder (stability=0.43), and com.google.zxing (stability=0.05). All dependencies are either more stable or equally stable, adhering to the Stable Dependencies Principle. Incoming dependencies come from less stable packages like com.google.zxing.qrcode (stability=0) and com.google.zxing.datamatrix (stability=0), which is acceptable as they depend on this package. Therefore, there is no unstable dependency smell."
