"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.maxicode.decoder has outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon, com.google.zxing.common, and com.google.zxing. All these dependencies are more stable than the analyzed package as they have higher LOC, more classes, and higher Ca (afferent couplings) values, indicating greater stability. The package follows the Stable Dependencies Principle by depending on more stable packages."
