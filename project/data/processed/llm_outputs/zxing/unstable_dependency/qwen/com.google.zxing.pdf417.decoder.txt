"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder has a stability value of 0.857 (Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 6/(1+6)), making it unstable. Its outgoing dependencies include packages like com.google.zxing.common (stability = 0.033), com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder (stability = 0.5), and com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec (stability = 0.75). All these dependencies are more stable than the analyzed package, which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
