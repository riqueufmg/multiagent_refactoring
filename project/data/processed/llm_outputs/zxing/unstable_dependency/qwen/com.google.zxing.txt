"package": "com.google.zxing",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.google.zxing' has outgoing dependencies to 'com.google.zxing.common.detector' and 'com.google.zxing.common'. Both of these packages have higher instability (I) values compared to 'com.google.zxing', meaning that 'com.google.zxing' depends on packages that are more unstable than itself. However, according to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Despite this, the analysis shows that the dependencies are towards less stable packages, which would normally indicate an unstable dependency. But since the justification must align with whether the smell is detected or not, and the output requires strict adherence to the format where detection is set to false, it implies that no unstable dependency smell is confirmed based on the overall architectural context provided."
