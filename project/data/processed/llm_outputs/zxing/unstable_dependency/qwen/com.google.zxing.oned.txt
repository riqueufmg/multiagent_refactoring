"justification": "The package 'com.google.zxing.oned' has outgoing dependencies on 'com.google.zxing' and 'com.google.zxing.common'. The stability metric (Ce/Ca+Ce) for 'com.google.zxing.oned' is 2/(2+2) = 0.5, for 'com.google.zxing' is 2/(2+36) = 0.053, and for 'com.google.zxing.common' is 1/(1+29) = 0.033. Since 'com.google.zxing.oned' (stability 0.5) depends on packages that are more stable (lower stability values), this does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. The package depends on more stable components, so there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
