"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.oned.rss has stability of 0.33 (Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 3/(3+1) = 0.33). Its outgoing dependencies are com.google.zxing (stability = 2/(2+36) = 0.05), com.google.zxing.common.detector (stability = 2/(2+8) = 0.2), and com.google.zxing.common (stability = 1/(1+29) = 0.03). All dependencies have lower stability values than the analyzed package, meaning it depends on more stable packages. This follows the Stable Dependencies Principle, so no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
