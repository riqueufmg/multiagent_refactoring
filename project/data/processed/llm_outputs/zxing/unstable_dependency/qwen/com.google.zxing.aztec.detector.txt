"justification": "The package 'com.google.zxing.aztec.detector' has a stability value of 0.857 (Ce=6, Ca=1, Stability = Ce/(Ce+Ca)), and all of its outgoing dependencies have stability values less than or equal to 0.857. The dependent packages are: 'com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder' (Stability=0.625), 'com.google.zxing.common.detector' (Stability=0.2), 'com.google.zxing.common' (Stability=0.033), 'com.google.zxing.aztec' (Stability=0.571), 'com.google.zxing' (Stability=0.053), and 'com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon' (Stability=0). Since this package depends only on packages that are more stable or equally stable, it does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
