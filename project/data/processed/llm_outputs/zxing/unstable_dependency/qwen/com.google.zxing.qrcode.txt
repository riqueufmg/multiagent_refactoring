"justification": "The package 'com.google.zxing.qrcode' has a stability value of 0.67 (Ce=4, Ca=0, stability = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 4/4 = 1.0 if Ca=0, but using standard formula Ce/(Ce+Ca) where Ca=0 results in undefined, however using Ce/(Ce+Ca+1) or considering practical stability as Ce/(Ce+Ca) when Ca=0 gives 1.0, but more accurately using the standard approach where stability = Ce/(Ce+Ca) and when Ca=0 it's fully unstable. But for purpose of this analysis, we calculate stability as Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 4/(4+0) = 1.0. All dependencies have stability less than or equal to 1.0. 'com.google.zxing' has Ca=36, Ce=2, so stability = 2/(2+36) = 0.053. 'com.google.zxing.common' has Ca=29, Ce=1, stability = 1/(1+29) = 0.034. 'com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder' has Ca=4, Ce=3, stability = 3/(3+4) = 0.429. 'com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder' has Ca=2, Ce=4, stability = 4/(4+2) = 0.667. Since the analyzed package has stability 1.0 and all its dependencies have stability values less than 1.0, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
