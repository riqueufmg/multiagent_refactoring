"package": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector has outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing.common, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder, com.google.zxing.common.detector, and com.google.zxing. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we must evaluate the stability of each dependency relative to the analyzed package. Stability is calculated as Ce / (Ca + Ce). For com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector, Ca = 1 and Ce = 4, so its stability is 4 / (1 + 4) = 0.8. The dependencies have the following stabilities: com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29, Stability=1/30≈0.033), com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder (Ce=3, Ca=4, Stability=3/7≈0.428), com.google.zxing.common.detector (Ce=2, Ca=8, Stability=2/10=0.2), and com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36, Stability=2/38≈0.053). All dependencies are more stable than the analyzed package (stability < 0.8), so there is no unstable dependency."
