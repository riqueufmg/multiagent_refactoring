"justification": "The package 'com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded' has a stability value (I) calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 7/(1+7) = 0.875, indicating it is unstable. All of its outgoing dependencies are to packages that are more stable (lower instability values): 'com.google.zxing.common.detector' (I=0.2), 'com.google.zxing.common' (I≈0.033), 'com.google.zxing' (I≈0.053), 'com.google.zxing.oned' (I=0.5), 'com.google.zxing.client.result' (I=0.25), 'com.google.zxing.oned.rss' (I=0.75), and 'com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders' (I=0.75). Since all dependencies are to more stable packages, this adheres to the Stable Dependencies Principle."
