"justification": "The package 'com.google.zxing.client.android.camera' depends on 'com.google.zxing.client.android' which has a higher instability (Ce=6, Ca=7) compared to itself (Ce=2, Ca=1). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle as an unstable package should not depend on a more unstable package."
