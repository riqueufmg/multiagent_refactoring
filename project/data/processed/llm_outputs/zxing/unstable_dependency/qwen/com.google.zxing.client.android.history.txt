Its outgoing dependencies are: 'com.google.zxing.client.android.result' (stability = 3/(2+3) = 0.6), 'com.google.zxing.client.android' (stability = 6/(7+6) = 0.46), and 'com.google.zxing' (stability = 2/(36+2) = 0.052). The package depends on components that are more stable or equally stable, following the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
