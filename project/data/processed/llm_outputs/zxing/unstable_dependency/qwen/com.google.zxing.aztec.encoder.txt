"package": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder' has a stability value of 0.625 (Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 5/(3+5)). Its outgoing dependencies are: 'com.google.zxing.common' (stability = 0.033), 'com.google.zxing.aztec' (stability = 0.571), 'com.google.zxing' (stability = 0.053), 'com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon' (stability = 0), and 'com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder' (stability = 0.833). All dependencies except 'com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder' are more stable (lower stability values) than the analyzed package. However, 'com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder' (stability = 0.833) is less stable than the analyzed package (0.625), which violates the Stable Dependencies Principle. But since the primary direction of dependencies is towards more stable packages, and only one dependency violates this, the overall architecture does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
