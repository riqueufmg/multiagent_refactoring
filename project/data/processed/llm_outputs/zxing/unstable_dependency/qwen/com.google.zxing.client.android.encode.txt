"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.client.android.encode has outgoing dependencies to packages that are more stable (higher Ca and lower Ce values) or equally stable, thus not violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. The outgoing dependencies are: com.google.zxing.client.android (Ca=7, Ce=6, I=0.46), com.google.zxing.client.result (Ca=6, Ce=2, I=0.25), com.google.zxing (Ca=36, Ce=2, I=0.05), and com.google.zxing.common (Ca=29, Ce=1, I=0.03). All these packages have higher or equal stability compared to the analyzed package (Ca=0, Ce=4, I=1.0), which means it depends on more stable or equally stable packages, adhering to the principle."
