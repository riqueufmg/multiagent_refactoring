"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder has outgoing dependencies on packages that are less stable or equally stable, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. Specifically, it depends on com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder (I=0.6, A=0.38) which has a lower stability (higher I value) than the decoder package itself (I=0.83, A=0.5). Additionally, the mutual dependency between decoder and encoder packages creates an unstable circular dependency."
