"justification": "This package has stability of 1.0 (Ce=0, Ca=1, so I/(I+A) = 0/(0+1) = 0, thus stability = 1 - 0 = 1.0). The package that depends on it (com.google.zxing.client.android.camera) has stability of 0.67 (Ce=2, Ca=1, so I/(I+A) = 2/(2+1) = 0.67, thus stability = 1 - 0.67 = 0.33). Since this package (stability 1.0) is more stable than the package that depends on it (stability 0.33), the Stable Dependencies Principle is followed and there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
