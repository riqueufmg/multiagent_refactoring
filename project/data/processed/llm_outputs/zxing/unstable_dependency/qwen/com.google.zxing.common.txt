"justification": "The package 'com.google.zxing.common' has a stability value (I) calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 1/(29+1) = 0.033. The outgoing dependency is 'com.google.zxing', which has a stability value of 2/(36+2) = 0.053. Since the stability of the outgoing dependency (0.053) is greater than the stability of 'com.google.zxing.common' (0.033), this does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
