"package": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.client.j2se has outgoing dependencies on com.google.zxing.multi, com.google.zxing, com.google.zxing.common, and com.google.zxing.client.result. To evaluate stability, we consider the instability metric (I = Ce / (Ce + Ca)). For com.google.zxing.client.j2se, I = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8. The dependencies have the following instabilities: com.google.zxing.multi (I = 2 / (2 + 4) = 0.33), com.google.zxing (I = 2 / (2 + 36) = 0.05), com.google.zxing.common (I = 1 / (1 + 29) = 0.03), and com.google.zxing.client.result (I = 2 / (2 + 6) = 0.25). All dependencies are more stable (lower instability) than the analyzed package, thus adhering to the Stable Dependencies Principle."
