"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder has a stability value of 0.2 (Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 3/(3+4)). Its outgoing dependencies are com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon (stability 0), com.google.zxing.common (stability 0.03), and com.google.zxing (stability 0.05). All these dependencies have lower or equal stability values, which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
