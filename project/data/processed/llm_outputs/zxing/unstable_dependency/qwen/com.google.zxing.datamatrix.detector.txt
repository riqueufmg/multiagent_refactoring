"package": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.detector",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.datamatrix.detector has outgoing dependencies on com.google.zxing.common, com.google.zxing.common.detector, and com.google.zxing. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we need to calculate stability (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)) for each package. com.google.zxing.datamatrix.detector has Ce=3, Ca=0, so I=1.0 (maximally unstable). com.google.zxing.common has Ce=1, Ca=29, so I=0.033 (highly stable). com.google.zxing.common.detector has Ce=2, Ca=8, so I=0.2 (relatively stable). com.google.zxing has Ce=2, Ca=36, so I=0.053 (highly stable). Since the analyzed package is maximally unstable (I=1.0) and depends only on packages that are more stable (lower I values), it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
