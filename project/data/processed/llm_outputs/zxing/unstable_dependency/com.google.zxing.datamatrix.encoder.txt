  "package": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "Analyzed package stability: Ca=1, Ce=1 → instability I=1/(1+1)=0.5. Its outgoing dependency is com.google.zxing (Ca=36, Ce=2 → I=36/(36+2)=0.947), which is more stable than the analyzed package, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated. There are incoming dependencies from com.google.zxing.datamatrix (Ca=0, Ce=5 → I=0.0), but incoming unstable dependents do not create an unstable dependency smell for this package. Therefore no unstable dependency detected."
