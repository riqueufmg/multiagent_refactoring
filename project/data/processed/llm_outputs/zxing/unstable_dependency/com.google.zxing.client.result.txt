"justification": "Compute instability I = Ce / (Ca + Ce). com.google.zxing.client.result: Ce=2, Ca=6 → I = 2/8 = 0.25 (relatively stable). Outgoing dependency com.google.zxing.oned: Ce=2, Ca=2 → I = 2/4 = 0.5 (more unstable). Outgoing dependency com.google.zxing: Ce=2, Ca=36 → I = 2/38 ≈ 0.0526 (more stable). Because com.google.zxing.client.result (I=0.25) depends on com.google.zxing.oned (I=0.5), it depends on a less stable package, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. The presence of multiple incoming dependencies (Ca=6) further indicates com.google.zxing.client.result is relatively stable and should not depend on a more unstable package, so the Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
