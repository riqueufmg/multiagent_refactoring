"package": "com.google.zxing.common",
"detection": true,
"justification": "com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29, Instability I=1/(1+29)=0.0333) has an outgoing dependency on com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36, I=2/(2+36)=0.0526). According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should only depend on packages that are more stable (lower I) than itself. Here com.google.zxing.common is more stable (lower I) than its dependency com.google.zxing, so it depends on a less stable package. The high Ca (29) and low Ce (1) indicate com.google.zxing.common is a stable package relied on by many incoming packages, which reinforces that its dependency on the less stable com.google.zxing is an unstable dependency smell."
