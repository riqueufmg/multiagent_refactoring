"justification": "com.google.zxing.oned has Ce=2 and Ca=2 (stability I = 2/(2+2) = 0.50). Its outgoing dependencies are com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36, I = 36/(36+2) ≈ 0.947) and com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29, I = 29/(29+1) ≈ 0.967). Both target packages are substantially more stable (higher I) than com.google.zxing.oned, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and there is no unstable dependency. Incoming dependencies do not create an unstable dependency smell for this package."
