"package": "com.google.zxing.common.detector",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has Ca=8 and Ce=2 (stability I=8/(8+2)=0.80) and its outgoing dependencies are only to com.google.zxing (Ca=36, Ce=2, I=36/(36+2)=0.947) and com.google.zxing.common (Ca=29, Ce=1, I=29/(29+1)=0.967). Both target packages are more stable than the analyzed package and the package has more incoming than outgoing couplings, so dependencies point toward more stable packages. Therefore there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
