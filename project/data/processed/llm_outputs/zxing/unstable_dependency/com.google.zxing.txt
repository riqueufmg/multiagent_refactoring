"justification": "com.google.zxing has Ce=2 and Ca=36 => instability I = 2/(36+2) = 0.0526 (stable). It has outgoing dependencies to: com.google.zxing.common (Ce=1, Ca=29 => I = 1/30 = 0.0333) and com.google.zxing.common.detector (Ce=2, Ca=8 => I = 2/10 = 0.2). The dependency to com.google.zxing.common.detector violates the Stable Dependencies Principle because com.google.zxing depends on a less stable package (I_common.detector = 0.2 > I_com.google.zxing = 0.0526). Therefore an Unstable Dependency smell is detected. The dependency to com.google.zxing.common is acceptable (more stable: 0.0333 < 0.0526)."
