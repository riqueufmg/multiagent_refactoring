Outgoing dependencies: com.google.zxing (Ce=2, Ca=36 => I=0.053), com.google.zxing.client.android (Ce=6, Ca=7 => I≈0.462), com.google.zxing.client.android.result (Ce=3, Ca=2 => I=0.60). None of the outgoing dependencies is less stable (i.e., has a higher instability I) than the analyzed package (all have I <= 0.60), so the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
