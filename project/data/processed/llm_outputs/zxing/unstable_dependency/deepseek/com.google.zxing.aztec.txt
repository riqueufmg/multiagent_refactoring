  "package": "com.google.zxing.aztec",

  "justification": "Analyzed package instability (Ce/(Ca+Ce)=4/(3+4)=0.571). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability values: com.google.zxing.common (0.033), com.google.zxing (0.053), com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder (0.625) is higher, but com.google.zxing.aztec.detector (0.857) is higher. However, the package depends on the highly stable core packages (com.google.zxing.common and com.google.zxing) with instability <0.1, and its dependencies on less stable sibling packages are bidirectional/circular as shown in incoming dependencies, indicating cohesive subsystem structure rather than problematic unstable dependency."
