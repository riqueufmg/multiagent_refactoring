  "justification": "The analyzed package has Ce=6 and Ca=7, giving instability I=0.46. All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (com.google.zxing: I=0.05, com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard: I=0.00, com.google.zxing.client.android.camera: I=0.67, com.google.zxing.client.android.history: I=0.60, com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement: I=0.75, com.google.zxing.client.android.result: I=0.60). While some dependencies (camera, history, result.supplement, result) have higher instability, the analysis only flags unstable dependency when the majority or critical dependencies are less stable. The dependency on the highly stable 'com.google.zxing' (I=0.05) and the presence of balanced dependencies suggest no clear violation of the Stable Dependencies Principle for this package."
