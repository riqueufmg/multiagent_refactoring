    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. BufferedImageLuminanceSource has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecodeWorker and com.google.zxing.client.j2se.GUIRunner). The small number of incoming links and absence of outgoing links indicate it is not acting as a hub."
