    "justification": "DecodeHintType has many incoming dependencies (21 distinct classes reference it, e.g. com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecoderConfig, com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeThread, com.google.zxing.MultiFormatReader, com.google.zxing.qrcode.QRCodeReader, com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.Detector, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.DataMatrixReader, com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecReader). However, it has no outgoing dependencies (0). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because outgoing dependencies are absent, the smell is not detected."
