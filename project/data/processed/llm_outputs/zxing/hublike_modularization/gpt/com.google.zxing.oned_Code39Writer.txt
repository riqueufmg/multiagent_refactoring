    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code39Writer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Code39Writer has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.oned.Code39Reader and com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat). Although one outgoing target (Code39Reader) itself depends on many classes, Code39Writer’s own incoming/outgoing degree is low and asymmetric (no incoming links), so it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
