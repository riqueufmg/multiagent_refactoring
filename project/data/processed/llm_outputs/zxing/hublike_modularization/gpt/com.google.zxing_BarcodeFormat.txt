    "class": "com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BarcodeFormat is referenced by a large number of other classes (52 incoming dependencies listed, e.g., MultiFormatReader, Result, QRCodeWriter, numerous oned/* readers/writers, etc.), but it has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; since BarcodeFormat lacks outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the definition."
