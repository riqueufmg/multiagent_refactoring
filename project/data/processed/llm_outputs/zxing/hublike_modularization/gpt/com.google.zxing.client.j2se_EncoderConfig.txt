    "justification": "EncoderConfig has only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.client.j2se.CommandLineEncoder) and 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the observed counts (incoming=1, outgoing=1) are too low to classify it as a hub."
