    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MatrixUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MatrixUtil has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions: ByteMatrix, QRCode, ErrorCorrectionLevel, BitArray, MaskUtil, and Version. It has only a single incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.Encoder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections; here the incoming coupling is low (1), so MatrixUtil does not meet the criterion for a hub-like module."
