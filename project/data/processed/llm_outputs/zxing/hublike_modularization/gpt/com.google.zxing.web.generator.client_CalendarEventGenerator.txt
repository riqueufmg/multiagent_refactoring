    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.StylesDefs, com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.GeneratorException, com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.TimeZoneList) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and therefore does not meet the smell."
