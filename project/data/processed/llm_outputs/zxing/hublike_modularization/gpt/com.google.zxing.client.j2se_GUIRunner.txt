    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.GUIRunner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: GUIRunner has outgoing dependencies to 5 classes (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.client.j2se.ImageReader, com.google.zxing.client.j2se.BufferedImageLuminanceSource, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap, com.google.zxing.LuminanceSource) but has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections; here incoming_dependencies is empty (0), so the hub smell is not present."
