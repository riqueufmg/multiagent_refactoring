    "detection": false,
    "justification": "EdifactEncoder has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 outgoing dependencies (HighLevelEncoder, EncoderContext). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; EdifactEncoder lacks incoming connections and has a low outgoing count, so it does not exhibit the smell."
