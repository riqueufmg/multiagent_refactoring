    "justification": "HighLevelEncoder has a small number of dependencies: outgoing to 2 classes (com.google.zxing.common.CharacterSetECI, com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.State) and incoming from 2 classes (com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.Encoder, com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.State). There are only 3 unique other abstractions involved (Encoder, State, CharacterSetECI), with State appearing in both directions. This count is low and does not constitute a hub-like module (which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions)."
