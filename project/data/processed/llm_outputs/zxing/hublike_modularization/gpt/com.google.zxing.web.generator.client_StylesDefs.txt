    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StylesDefs is referenced by a large number of other classes (10 incoming dependents: WifiGenerator, GeoLocationGenerator, EmailGenerator, ContactInfoGenerator, SmsAddressGenerator, CalendarEventGenerator, Generator, PhoneNumberGenerator, UrlGenerator, TextGenerator), but it has no outgoing dependencies (analyzed_package.dependencies = [] and outgoing_dependencies = []). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here StylesDefs is a widely used sink but does not depend on many other abstractions, so the hub-like smell is not present."
