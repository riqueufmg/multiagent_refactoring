    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.QRCodeMultiReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "QRCodeMultiReader has outgoing dependencies to 7 abstractions: com.google.zxing.common.DecoderResult, com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.common.DetectorResult, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap, com.google.zxing.ResultMetadataType. However, it has 0 incoming dependencies (no other classes depend on it). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because incoming dependencies are absent, this class is not a hub."
