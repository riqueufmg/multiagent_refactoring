    "justification": "LoadPackagesAsyncTask has only one incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.client.android.share.AppPickerActivity) and no outgoing dependencies. Because it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (incoming count = 1, outgoing count = 0), it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
