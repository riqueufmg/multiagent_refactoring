    "justification": "VINParsedResult has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.client.result.ParsedResultType) and a single incoming dependency from com.google.zxing.client.result.VINResultParser. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows low counts on both sides, so the smell is not present."
