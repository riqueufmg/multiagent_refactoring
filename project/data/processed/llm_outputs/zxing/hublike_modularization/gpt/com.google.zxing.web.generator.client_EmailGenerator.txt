    "detection": false,
    "justification": "EmailGenerator has 3 outgoing dependencies (StylesDefs, GeneratorException, Validators) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; EmailGenerator's connections are few and limited to the same package (and Validators' dependency on GeneratorException does not create additional incoming links to EmailGenerator). Therefore it is not a hub."
