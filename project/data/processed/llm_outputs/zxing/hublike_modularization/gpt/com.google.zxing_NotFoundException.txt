    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is referenced by a large number of other classes (46 incoming dependencies, e.g. com.google.zxing.Reader, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap, com.google.zxing.qrcode.QRCodeReader, com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Reader, com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader, com.google.zxing.common.GridSampler), but it has 0 outgoing dependencies (its dependency list is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires many dependencies both incoming and outgoing; here only incoming are numerous while outgoing is nil, so the smell is not detected."
