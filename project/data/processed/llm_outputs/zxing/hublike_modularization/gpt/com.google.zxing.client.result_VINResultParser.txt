    "justification": "Not detected: VINResultParser has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.result.VINParsedResult, com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming count is zero and outgoing count is small, so the hub smell is not present."
