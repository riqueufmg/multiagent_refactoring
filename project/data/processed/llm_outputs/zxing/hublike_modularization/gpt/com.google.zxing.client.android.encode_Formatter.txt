    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. In the provided data, Formatter has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 3 incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.VCardContactEncoder, com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.ContactEncoder, com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.MECARDContactEncoder). Because there are no outgoing dependencies and the number of incoming dependencies is small, the class does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
