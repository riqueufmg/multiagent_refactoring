    "justification": "Based on the provided data, DecodedInformation has 4 incoming dependencies (GeneralAppIdDecoder, AI01392xDecoder, BlockParsedResult, AI01393xDecoder) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because outgoing dependencies are absent (0), this class does not meet the 'both incoming and outgoing with many neighbors' criterion and is not a hub-like module."
