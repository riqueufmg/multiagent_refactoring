    "justification": "ClipboardInterface has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity and com.google.zxing.client.android.share.ShareActivity). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition."
