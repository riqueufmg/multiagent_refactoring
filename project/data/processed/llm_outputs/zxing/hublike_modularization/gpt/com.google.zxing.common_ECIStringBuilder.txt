    "justification": "ECIStringBuilder is not a hub: it has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.FormatException, com.google.zxing.common.CharacterSetECI) and only 2 incoming dependents (DecodedBitStreamParser in com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder and DecodedBitStreamParser in com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder). The number of incoming/outgoing relationships is small and does not indicate an abstraction with widespread coupling to many other abstractions."
