    "justification": "GenericGFPoly has outgoing dependencies to 1 abstraction (com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.GenericGF) and incoming dependencies from 3 abstractions (com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.GenericGF, ReedSolomonEncoder, ReedSolomonDecoder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided counts (1 outgoing, 3 incoming) are small, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
