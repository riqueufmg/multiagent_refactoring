    "justification": "ASCIIEncoder has outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.HighLevelEncoder and com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.EncoderContext (2 outgoing) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition."
