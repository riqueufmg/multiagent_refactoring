    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no classes depend on WifiResultHandler). Outgoing dependencies: 3 direct dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity, com.google.zxing.client.result.ParsedResult, com.google.zxing.client.result.WifiParsedResult). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; WifiResultHandler has neither a large number of incoming dependencies nor an excessive number of outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
