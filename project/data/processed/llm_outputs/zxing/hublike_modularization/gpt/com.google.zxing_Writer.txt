    "class": "com.google.zxing.Writer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.WriterException, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.MultiFormatWriter). These are small counts and do not constitute dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, so it is not a hub-like modularization."
