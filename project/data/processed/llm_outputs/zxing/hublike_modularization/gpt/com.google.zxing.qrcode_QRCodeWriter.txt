    "justification": "QRCodeWriter has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct abstractions (ByteMatrix, BitMatrix, Encoder, BarcodeFormat, QRCode, ErrorCorrectionLevel, EncodeHintType) but has 0 incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; because incoming dependencies are absent, QRCodeWriter does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell based on the given metrics."
