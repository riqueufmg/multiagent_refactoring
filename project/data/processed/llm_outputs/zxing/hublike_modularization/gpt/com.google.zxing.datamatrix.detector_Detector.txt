    "justification": "Detector has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct abstractions (com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.common.GridSampler, com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.common.detector.WhiteRectangleDetector) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; since incoming_dependencies is empty, Detector is not a hub."
