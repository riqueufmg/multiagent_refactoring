    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. TelParsedResult has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.client.result.ParsedResultType) and only 2 incoming dependents (com.google.zxing.client.android.result.TelResultHandler and com.google.zxing.client.result.TelResultParser), totaling 3 interacting classes. This is a small number of incoming/outgoing ties, so it does not qualify as a hub."
