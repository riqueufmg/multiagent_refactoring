    "justification": "DecodedNumeric has only one incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.GeneralAppIdDecoder) and one outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.FormatException). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low incoming and outgoing degree, so the smell is not present."
