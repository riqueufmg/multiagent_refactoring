    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization is not detected. The class has a small number of relationships: 2 incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser and com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.Encoder) and 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.DecodeHintType). A hub would have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the connection counts are low, so StringUtils does not act as a hub in isolation."
