    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. AlignmentPatternFinder has 4 outgoing dependencies: com.google.zxing.ResultPointCallback, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.AlignmentPattern. It has a single incoming dependency entry: com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.Detector. The counts of incoming (1) and outgoing (4) dependencies are small and do not indicate a hub-like role, so the smell is not detected."
