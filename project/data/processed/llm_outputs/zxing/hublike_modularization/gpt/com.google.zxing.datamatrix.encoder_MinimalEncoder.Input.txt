    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.MinimalEncoder) and 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.SymbolShapeHint). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies; these counts are low, so the smell is not present."
