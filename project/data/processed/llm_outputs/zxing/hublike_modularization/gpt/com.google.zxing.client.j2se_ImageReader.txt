    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.ImageReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ImageReader has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 3 incoming dependencies (from com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecodeWorker, com.google.zxing.client.j2se.GUIRunner, com.google.zxing.web.DecodeServlet). The hub-like smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships with other abstractions; ImageReader lacks outgoing dependencies and has a small number of incoming references, so it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
