    "justification": "BitMatrixParser has a single outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix) and a single incoming dependency entry (com.google.zxing.maxicode.decoder.Decoder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows low counts (1 outgoing, 1 incoming), so the smell is not present."
