    "justification": "SearchBookContentsResult has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []) and only three incoming dependencies (SearchBookContentsAdapter, SearchBookContentsListItem, BrowseBookListener). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing count is zero and incoming count is small, so the smell is not detected."
