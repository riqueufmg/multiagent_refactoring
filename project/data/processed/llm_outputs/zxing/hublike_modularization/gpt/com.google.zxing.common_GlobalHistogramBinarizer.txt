    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions: com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.LuminanceSource, and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relations; because there are no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty), this class is not a hub."
