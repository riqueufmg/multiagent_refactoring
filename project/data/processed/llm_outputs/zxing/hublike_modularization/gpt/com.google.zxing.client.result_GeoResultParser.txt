    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.GeoResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. GeoResultParser has outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes (com.google.zxing.Result and com.google.zxing.client.result.GeoParsedResult) and has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Because it lacks a large number of incoming dependencies and only depends on two abstractions, it does not qualify as a hub."
