    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. URIResultHandler has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (com.google.zxing.client.result.ParsedResult, com.google.zxing.client.android.LocaleManager, com.google.zxing.client.result.URIParsedResult) but has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Because it lacks a large number of incoming dependencies, it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
