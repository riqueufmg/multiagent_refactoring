    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Version). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing links). The provided data shows minimal incoming/outgoing connections, so it is not a hub."
