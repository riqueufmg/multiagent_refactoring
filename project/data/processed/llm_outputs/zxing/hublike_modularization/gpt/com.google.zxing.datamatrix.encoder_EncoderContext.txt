    "detection": true,
    "justification": "EncoderContext has many incoming dependencies (7 distinct classes: Encoder, EdifactEncoder, HighLevelEncoder, ASCIIEncoder, Base256Encoder, C40Encoder, X12Encoder) and multiple outgoing dependencies (3 classes: SymbolShapeHint, SymbolInfo, Dimension), for a total of 10 distinct connected abstractions. This concentration of both incoming and outgoing links indicates a hub-like modularization: EncoderContext functions as a central coordinator relied on by many encoders while depending on several supporting abstractions."
