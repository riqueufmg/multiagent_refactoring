    "justification": "Not detected: ISBNResultParser has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.client.result.ISBNParsedResult, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming = 0 and outgoing is small, so it does not qualify as a hub."
