    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.EAN8Writer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "EAN8Writer has 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows neither a high outgoing degree nor any incoming dependencies, so this class is not a hub."
