    "justification": "Detector has 4 outgoing dependencies: com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.pdf417.detector.PDF417DetectorResult, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap; and only 1 incoming dependency: com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Reader. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing fan-out is moderate but the incoming fan-in is low, so this does not qualify as a hub."
