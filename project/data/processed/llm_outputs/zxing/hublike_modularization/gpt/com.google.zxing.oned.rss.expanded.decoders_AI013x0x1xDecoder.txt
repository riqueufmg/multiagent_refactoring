    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not exhibit a large number of either incoming or outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not present."
