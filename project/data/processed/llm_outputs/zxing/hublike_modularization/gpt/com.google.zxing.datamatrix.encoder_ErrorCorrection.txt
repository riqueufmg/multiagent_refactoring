    "justification": "ErrorCorrection has 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.SymbolInfo) and 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.DataMatrixWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the observed counts are low, so this class is not a hub."
