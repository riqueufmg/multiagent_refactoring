    "detection": false,
    "justification": "QRCode has 3 incoming dependents (com.google.zxing.qrcode.QRCodeWriter, com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.Encoder, com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MatrixUtil) and 4 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.ByteMatrix, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.ErrorCorrectionLevel, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Version, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Mode). The numbers of distinct incoming and outgoing connections are small and limited to a few closely related QR code/domain classes, so it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell (which requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions)."
