    "justification": "X12Encoder has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.HighLevelEncoder, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.EncoderContext). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
