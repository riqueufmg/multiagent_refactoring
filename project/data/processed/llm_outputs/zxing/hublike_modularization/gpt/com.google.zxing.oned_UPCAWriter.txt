    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.UPCAWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "UPCAWriter has only outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing.oned.EAN13Writer and com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat (2 outgoing) and has no incoming dependencies (0 incoming). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; these counts are small and there are no incoming links, so UPCAWriter is not a hub."
