    "justification": "BookmarkDoCoMoResultParser has 0 incoming dependencies (no other abstractions depend on it) and only 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.client.result.URIResultParser, com.google.zxing.client.result.URIParsedResult). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming=0 and outgoing=3, so it does not qualify as a hub. Note: the outgoing target classes have their own dependencies, but those are not incoming to the analyzed class and do not make it hub-like."
