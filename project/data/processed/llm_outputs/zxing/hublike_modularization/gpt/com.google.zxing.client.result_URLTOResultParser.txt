    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no other abstractions depend on this class). Outgoing dependencies: 2 (com.google.zxing.Result and com.google.zxing.client.result.URIParsedResult). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here there are no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing dependences, so the smell is not present."
