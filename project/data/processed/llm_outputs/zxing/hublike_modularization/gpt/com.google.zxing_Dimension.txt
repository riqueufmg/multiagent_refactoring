    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Dimension has no outgoing dependencies (empty dependency list) and only four incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.DataMatrixWriter, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.EncoderContext, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.SymbolInfo, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.HighLevelEncoder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; Dimension lacks outgoing dependencies and therefore does not meet the criteria."
