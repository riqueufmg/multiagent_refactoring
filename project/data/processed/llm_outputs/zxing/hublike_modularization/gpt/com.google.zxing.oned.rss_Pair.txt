    "justification": "The Pair class has only one outgoing dependency: com.google.zxing.oned.rss.FinderPattern, and only one incoming dependency recorded: com.google.zxing.oned.rss.RSS14Reader. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies with numerous other abstractions; Pair does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies based on the provided data."
