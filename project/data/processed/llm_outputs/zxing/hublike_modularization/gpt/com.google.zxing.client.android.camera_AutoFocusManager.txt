    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.AutoFocusManager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AutoFocusManager has only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraManager) and 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.PreferencesActivity and its nested AutoFocusManager.AutoFocusTask). The number of distinct incoming and outgoing relationships is small, and one outgoing dependency is an inner class, so it does not exhibit the many-to-many coupling characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
