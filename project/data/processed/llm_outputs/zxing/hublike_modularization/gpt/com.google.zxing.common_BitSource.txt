    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: BitSource has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only two incoming dependents (com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser and com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser). The smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows neither a large number of incoming dependents nor any outgoing dependencies."
