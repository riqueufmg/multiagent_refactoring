    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. For com.google.zxing.aztec.detector.Detector.Point: outgoing_dependencies = [] (none) and incoming_dependencies = 1 (only com.google.zxing.aztec.detector.Detector references Detector.Point). Although Detector (the incoming caller) lists many dependencies, Detector.Point itself has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency, so it does not meet the 'hub-like' criterion."
