    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DecodedBitStreamParser has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (4: DecodedBitStreamParser.Mode, com.google.zxing.FormatException, com.google.zxing.common.BitSource, com.google.zxing.common.ECIStringBuilder) and only one incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Decoder). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections; here both incoming and outgoing coupling are limited. (Note: ECIStringBuilder itself depends on FormatException and CharacterSetECI, but that does not make DecodedBitStreamParser a hub given its low direct fan-in/fan-out.)"
