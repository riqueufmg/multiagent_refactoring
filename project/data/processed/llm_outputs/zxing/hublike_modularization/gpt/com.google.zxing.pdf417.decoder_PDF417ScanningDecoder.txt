    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are numerous (19 distinct classes: e.g. com.google.zxing.common.DecoderResult, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResultColumn, DetectionResult, BoundingBox, PDF417CodewordDecoder, DecodedBitStreamParser, ErrorCorrection, Codeword, BarcodeMetadata, ResultPoint, etc.), indicating the class depends on many abstractions. However incoming dependencies are minimal (only one recorded incoming dependency: com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Reader references PDF417ScanningDecoder). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here only outgoing is large while incoming is small, so the smell is not detected."
