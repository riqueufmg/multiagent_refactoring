    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BitMatrixParser has 5 outgoing dependencies (DataMask, FormatException, BitMatrix, FormatInformation, Version) but only 1 incoming dependency (Decoder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the incoming fan-in here is minimal (single client), so the hub-like smell is not present."
