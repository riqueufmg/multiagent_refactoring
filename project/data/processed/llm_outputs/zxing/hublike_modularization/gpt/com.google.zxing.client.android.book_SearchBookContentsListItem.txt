    "justification": "SearchBookContentsListItem has only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.client.android.book.SearchBookContentsAdapter) and 1 outgoing dependency (to com.google.zxing.client.android.book.SearchBookContentsResult). With only a single incoming and single outgoing relationship, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization, which requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies."
