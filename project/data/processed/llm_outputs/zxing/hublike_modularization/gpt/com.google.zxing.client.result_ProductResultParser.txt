    "justification": "ProductResultParser has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (com.google.zxing.client.result.ProductParsedResult, com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEReader, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; since there are no incoming dependencies here, this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
