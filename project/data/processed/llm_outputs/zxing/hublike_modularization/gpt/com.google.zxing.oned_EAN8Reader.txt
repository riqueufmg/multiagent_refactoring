    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing.common.BitArray and com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat (2 outgoing) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections; incoming=0 and outgoing=2 do not meet that criterion."
