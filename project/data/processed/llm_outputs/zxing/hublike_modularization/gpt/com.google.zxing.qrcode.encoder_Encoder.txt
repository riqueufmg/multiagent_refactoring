    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.Encoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 13 distinct types — ByteMatrix, CharacterSetECI, QRCode, ErrorCorrectionLevel, BitArray, Mode, GenericGF, StringUtils, MaskUtil, MatrixUtil, MinimalEncoder, Version, EncodeHintType. Incoming dependencies: 2 classes reference Encoder — com.google.zxing.qrcode.QRCodeWriter and com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MinimalEncoder (MinimalEncoder also appears in outgoing). Because the class has many outgoing dependencies but only two incoming dependents, it does not meet the definition of Hub-like Modularization (which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
