    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.DataBlock",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DataBlock has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.ErrorCorrectionLevel, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Version) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Decoder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; the direct dependency counts for DataBlock are low, so it is not a hub. (Although Version itself lists multiple dependencies, DataBlock's direct fan-in/fan-out remains small.)"
