    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.history.HistoryItem",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "HistoryItem has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.Result) and 3 incoming dependents (CaptureActivity, HistoryManager, HistoryItemAdapter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing dependency set is minimal, so HistoryItem does not qualify as a hub."
