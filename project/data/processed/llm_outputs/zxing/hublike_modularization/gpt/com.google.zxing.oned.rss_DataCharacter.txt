    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DataCharacter has 0 outgoing dependencies (no listed dependencies) and only 3 incoming dependents (RSS14Reader, RSSExpandedReader, ExpandedPair). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; DataCharacter lacks outgoing dependencies and only has a small number of incoming dependents, so the smell is not present."
