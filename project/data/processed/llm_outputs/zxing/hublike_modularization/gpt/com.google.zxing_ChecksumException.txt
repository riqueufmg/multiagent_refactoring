    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. com.google.zxing.ChecksumException has many incoming dependencies (10 distinct callers: com.google.zxing.Reader; com.google.zxing.maxicode.decoder.Decoder; com.google.zxing.oned.Code39Reader; com.google.zxing.oned.Code93Reader; com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Reader; com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader; com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder; com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ErrorCorrection; com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Decoder; com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Decoder) but its outgoing dependencies are empty. Because it does not have a large number of outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the definition (requires both significant incoming and outgoing coupling) and therefore is not detected as Hub-like Modularization."
