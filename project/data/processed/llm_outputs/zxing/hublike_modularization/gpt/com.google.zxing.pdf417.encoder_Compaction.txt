    "justification": "Compaction is referenced by four other classes (incoming dependencies from com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Writer, com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.PDF417, com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.PDF417HighLevelEncoder, com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.PDF417HighLevelEncoderTestAdapter) but has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing connections; here the outgoing degree is zero, so the smell is not detected."
