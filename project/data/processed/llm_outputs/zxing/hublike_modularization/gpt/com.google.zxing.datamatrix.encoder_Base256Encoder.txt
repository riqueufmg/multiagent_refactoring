    "justification": "Base256Encoder has only outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.HighLevelEncoder and com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.EncoderContext (2 outgoing) and has no incoming dependencies (0 incoming). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; these counts do not meet that criterion."
