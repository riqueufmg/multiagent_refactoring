The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of dependencies in both directions (many incoming and many outgoing). Since outgoing_dependencies = 0, MathUtils does not satisfy the bidirectional dependency condition and therefore is not detected as Hub-like Modularization."
