    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (com.google.zxing.ResultPoint and com.google.zxing.client.android.ViewfinderView) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that condition."
