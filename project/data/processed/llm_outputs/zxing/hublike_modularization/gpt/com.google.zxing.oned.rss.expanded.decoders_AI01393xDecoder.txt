    "justification": "AI01393xDecoder has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.DecodedInformation, com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; because incoming dependencies are zero and outgoing dependencies are few, the smell is not present."
