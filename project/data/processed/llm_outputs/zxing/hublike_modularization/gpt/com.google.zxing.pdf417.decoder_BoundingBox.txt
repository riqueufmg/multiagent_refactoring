    "justification": "BoundingBox has multiple incoming dependencies from four distinct decoder classes (com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResultColumn, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResult) and outgoing dependencies to three other abstractions (com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException). The combination of several incoming clients (core decoder components) and several outgoing collaborators shows BoundingBox functions as a central hub connecting many abstractions."
