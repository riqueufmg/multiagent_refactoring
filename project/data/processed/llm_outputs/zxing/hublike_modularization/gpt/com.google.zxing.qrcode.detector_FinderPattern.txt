    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. FinderPattern has 0 outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and 4 incoming dependents: com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector.MultiFinderPatternFinder, com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.FinderPatternFinder, com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.Detector, com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.FinderPatternInfo. Because it lacks outgoing dependencies and the incoming count (4) is not a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships, the hub-like smell is not detected."
