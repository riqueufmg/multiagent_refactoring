    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Code93Reader has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct abstractions (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.FormatException, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.ChecksumException, com.google.zxing.ResultMetadataType) but only a single incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.oned.Code93Writer). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections; here the incoming connectivity is minimal, so Code93Reader is not a hub."
