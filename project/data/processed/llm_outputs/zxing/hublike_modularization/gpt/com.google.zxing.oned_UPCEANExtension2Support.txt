    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANExtension2Support",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only one incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANExtensionSupport) and a modest number of outgoing dependencies (6): com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.ResultMetadataType, com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the incoming degree is low and the outgoing degree is not unusually large, so the criteria for the smell are not met."
