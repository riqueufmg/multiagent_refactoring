    "justification": "OpenCamera has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open.CameraFacing) and is referenced by 3 incoming abstractions (CameraConfigurationManager, CameraManager, OpenCameraInterface). These are low counts of incoming/outgoing dependencies and do not constitute a hub-like module."
