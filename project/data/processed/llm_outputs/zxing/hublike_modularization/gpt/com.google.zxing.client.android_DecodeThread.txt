    "justification": "DecodeThread has 6 outgoing dependencies (ResultPointCallback, CaptureActivity, DecodeHintType, PreferencesActivity, DecodeHandler, DecodeFormatManager) and only 2 incoming dependencies (CaptureActivityHandler, DecodeHandler). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides. Here the incoming fan-in is small (2), so despite a moderate outgoing set (6) and the fact that CaptureActivity itself is highly connected, DecodeThread does not exhibit the required large bi-directional connectivity to be considered hub-like."
