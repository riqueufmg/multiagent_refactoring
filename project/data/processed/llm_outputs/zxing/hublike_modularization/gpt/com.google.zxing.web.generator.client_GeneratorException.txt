    "detection": false,
    "justification": "GeneratorException has many incoming dependencies (11 classes depend on it: WifiGenerator, GeoLocationGenerator, GeneratorSource, EmailGenerator, ContactInfoGenerator, SmsAddressGenerator, CalendarEventGenerator, Validators, PhoneNumberGenerator, UrlGenerator, TextGenerator) but has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; since outgoing dependencies are absent, this is not a hub-like module."
