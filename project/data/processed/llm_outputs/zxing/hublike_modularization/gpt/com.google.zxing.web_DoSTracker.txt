    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.DoSTracker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DoSTracker has only 2 incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.web.DoSFilter, com.google.zxing.web.DecodeServlet) and 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.web.LRUMap). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; DoSTracker's incoming and outgoing degree is low, so the smell is not present."
