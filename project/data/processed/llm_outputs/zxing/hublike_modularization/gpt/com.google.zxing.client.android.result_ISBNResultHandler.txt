    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.result.ParsedResult, com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.client.result.ISBNParsedResult). Because incoming dependency count is zero and the outgoing count is small, this does not constitute a hub-like module."
