    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResultColumn",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DetectionResultColumn has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.BoundingBox, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.Codeword) and is referenced by 2 incoming classes (com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResult). Hub-like Modularization is characterized by an abstraction having incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of distinct abstractions; the direct incoming/outgoing counts for DetectionResultColumn are small, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell. (Note: although PDF417ScanningDecoder itself depends on many classes, those are not direct dependencies of DetectionResultColumn beyond the two listed.)"
