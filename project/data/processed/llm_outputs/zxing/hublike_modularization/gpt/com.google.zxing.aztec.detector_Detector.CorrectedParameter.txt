    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.aztec.detector.Detector). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections to other abstractions; CorrectedParameter does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
