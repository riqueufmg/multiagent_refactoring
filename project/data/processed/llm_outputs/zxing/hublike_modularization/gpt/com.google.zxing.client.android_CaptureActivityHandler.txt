    "justification": "CaptureActivityHandler has 5 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.Intents, com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity, com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivityHandler.State, com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraManager, com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeThread) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; here the incoming count is minimal, so the hub-like smell is not present."
