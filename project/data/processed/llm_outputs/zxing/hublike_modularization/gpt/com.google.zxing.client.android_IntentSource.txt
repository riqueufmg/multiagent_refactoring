    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. IntentSource has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity). Although CaptureActivity depends on many classes (including IntentSource), IntentSource itself is referenced by a single class and does not depend on other abstractions, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
