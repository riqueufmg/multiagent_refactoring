    "justification": "Reader has a broad set of outgoing dependencies (5 distinct abstractions: com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.FormatException, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.ChecksumException, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap) while also being depended upon by multiple other classes (4 distinct incoming clients: com.google.zxing.web.DecodeServlet, com.google.zxing.MultiFormatReader, com.google.zxing.multi.ByQuadrantReader, com.google.zxing.multi.GenericMultipleBarcodeReader). The presence of several domain types and exceptions in its outgoing set plus multiple, diverse incoming dependents indicates Reader functions as a central hub connecting many other abstractions, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
