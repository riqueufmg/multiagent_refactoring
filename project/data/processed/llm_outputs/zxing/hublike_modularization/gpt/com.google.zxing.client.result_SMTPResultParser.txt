    "justification": "SMTPResultParser has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.Result and com.google.zxing.client.result.EmailAddressParsedResult). A hub-like module would have many incoming and outgoing connections; this class does not meet that criterion."
