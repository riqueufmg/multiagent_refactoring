    "justification": "Not detected: the class has incoming dependencies from 2 classes (com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.AlignmentPatternFinder, com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.Detector) and no outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming_count=2 and outgoing_count=0, which does not meet that criterion."
