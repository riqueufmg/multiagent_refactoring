    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = 0) and only two outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.oned.CodaBarReader, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
