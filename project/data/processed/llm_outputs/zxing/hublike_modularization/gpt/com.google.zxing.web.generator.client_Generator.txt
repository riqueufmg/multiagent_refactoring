    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.GeneratorSource, com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.StylesDefs). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; the absence of incoming dependencies and the small number of outgoing dependencies indicate the smell is not present."
