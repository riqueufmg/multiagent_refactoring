    "justification": "Binarizer has only 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.LuminanceSource) and a single incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided counts are low, so the smell is not present."
