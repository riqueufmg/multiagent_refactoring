    "justification": "BarcodeValue has 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Common) and 2 incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder), totaling 3 connected abstractions. This small number of incoming/outgoing relationships does not meet the definition of a hub-like module (which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions)."
