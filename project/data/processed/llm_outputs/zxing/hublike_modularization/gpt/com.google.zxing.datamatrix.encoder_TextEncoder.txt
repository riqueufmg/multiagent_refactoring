    "justification": "TextEncoder has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.HighLevelEncoder) and no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; TextEncoder does not exhibit a large number of dependencies (outgoing=1, incoming=0), so it is not a hub."
