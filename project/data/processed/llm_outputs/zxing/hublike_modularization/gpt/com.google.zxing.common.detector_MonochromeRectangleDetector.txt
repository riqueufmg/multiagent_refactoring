    "justification": "MonochromeRectangleDetector has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming_dependencies is empty and the outgoing count is small (3), so it does not qualify as a hub."
