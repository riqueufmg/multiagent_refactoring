    "justification": "WhiteRectangleDetector has 4 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.common.detector.MathUtils, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException) but only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.detector.Detector). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing; here the incoming degree is minimal, so it does not qualify as a hub."
