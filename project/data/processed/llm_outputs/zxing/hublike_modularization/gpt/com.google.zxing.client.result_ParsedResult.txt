    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ParsedResult has many incoming dependencies (17 distinct classes depend on it — e.g. DecodeWorker, ResultHandlerFactory, numerous Android result handlers such as ProductResultHandler/TextResultHandler/URIResultHandler, SupplementalInfoRetriever, QRCodeEncoder, ResultParser), but only a single outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.client.result.ParsedResultType). Hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing dependency count is low (1), so the smell is not detected."
