    "justification": "ModulusPoly has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ModulusGF) and incoming dependencies from 2 classes (ModulusGF and ErrorCorrection). The total number of distinct connected abstractions is small (2), so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (no large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
