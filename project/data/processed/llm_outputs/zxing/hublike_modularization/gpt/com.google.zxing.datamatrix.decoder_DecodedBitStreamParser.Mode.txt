    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here Mode is referenced by a single class and does not depend on other abstractions, so it is not a hub."
