    "justification": "DefaultGridSampler has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.common.PerspectiveTransform, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition."
