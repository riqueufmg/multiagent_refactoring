    "detection": false,
    "justification": "OneDReader has 7 outgoing dependencies (Result, NotFoundException, DecodeHintType, BitArray, ResultPoint, BinaryBitmap, ResultMetadataType) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.oned.MultiFormatOneDReader). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections. Given the single incoming dependency and a moderate number of outgoing dependencies in the provided data, this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
