    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the class to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. SimpleToken has 0 incoming dependencies and 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.Token, com.google.zxing.common.BitArray). Because there are no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
