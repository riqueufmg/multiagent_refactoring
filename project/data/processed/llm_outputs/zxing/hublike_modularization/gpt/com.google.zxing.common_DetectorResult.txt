    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.DetectorResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DetectorResult has 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix) and 4 incoming dependents (MultiDetector, QRCodeMultiReader, QRCodeReader, DataMatrixReader). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; the observed counts (2 outgoing, 4 incoming) are small and represent expected usage as a simple data/result carrier rather than a hub, so the smell is not detected."
