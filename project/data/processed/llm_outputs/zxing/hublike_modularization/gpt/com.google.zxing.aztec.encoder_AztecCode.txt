    "justification": "AztecCode has only 2 incoming dependents (com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecWriter, com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.Encoder) and 1 direct outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the observed counts (2 incoming, 1 outgoing) are low. Note: BitMatrix itself depends on BitArray, but this is an indirect single additional relation and does not make AztecCode a hub."
