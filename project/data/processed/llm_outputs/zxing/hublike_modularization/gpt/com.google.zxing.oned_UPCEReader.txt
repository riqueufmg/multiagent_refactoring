    "justification": "UPCEReader has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat) and 2 incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEWriter, com.google.zxing.client.result.ProductResultParser). Both the number of incoming and outgoing connections is small, so it does not qualify as a hub-like modularization."
