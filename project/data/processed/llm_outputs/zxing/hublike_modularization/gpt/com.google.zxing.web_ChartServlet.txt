    "justification": "ChartServlet has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions (com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.ErrorCorrectionLevel, com.google.zxing.client.j2se.MatrixToImageWriter, com.google.zxing.EncodeHintType, com.google.zxing.web.ChartServletRequestParameters) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires having many both incoming and outgoing dependencies; since there are zero incoming dependencies, this class does not meet the hub-like pattern."
