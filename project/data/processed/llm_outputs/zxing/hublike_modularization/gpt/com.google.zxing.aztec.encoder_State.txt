    "detection": false,
    "justification": "State has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes (HighLevelEncoder, Token, BitArray) and incoming dependencies from 1 class (HighLevelEncoder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming degree is low (1) despite a mutual dependency with HighLevelEncoder, so State is not a hub."
