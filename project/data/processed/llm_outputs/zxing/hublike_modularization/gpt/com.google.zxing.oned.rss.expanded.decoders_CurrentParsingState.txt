    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.CurrentParsingState.State) and a single incoming dependency from com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.GeneralAppIdDecoder. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming=1 and outgoing=1, so the smell is not present."
