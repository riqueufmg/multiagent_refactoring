    "justification": "Incoming dependencies = 0 (no other abstractions depend on this class). Outgoing dependencies = 7 (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.FormatException, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.DecodeHintType, com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.ResultMetadataType). The hub-like modularization smell requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; since there are no incoming dependencies, ITFReader is not a hub."
