    "justification": "FormatInformation has only 1 outgoing dependency (ErrorCorrectionLevel) and 2 incoming dependents (Version, BitMatrixParser), i.e., it is connected to 3 other abstractions total. This small number of incoming and outgoing relationships does not meet the 'large number of other abstractions' criterion for Hub-like Modularization."
