    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.ByQuadrantReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ByQuadrantReader has 0 incoming dependencies and 4 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.Reader, com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here the incoming count is zero and the outgoing set is small, so the class is not a hub."
