    "justification": "CameraManager has multiple incoming and outgoing connections: incoming from CaptureActivityHandler, CaptureActivity, AmbientLightManager, and ViewfinderView (4 distinct callers), and outgoing to CameraConfigurationManager, AutoFocusManager, OpenCamera, PreviewCallback, and OpenCameraInterface (5 distinct collaborators). Because it both depends on a number of camera subcomponents and is depended upon by several higher-level components, it functions as a central coordinator (hub) for camera-related interactions, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
