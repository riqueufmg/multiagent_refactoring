    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.common.BitArray) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; these counts are low and do not meet that criterion."
