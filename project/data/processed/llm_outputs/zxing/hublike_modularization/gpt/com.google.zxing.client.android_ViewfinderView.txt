    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.ViewfinderView",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ViewfinderView has only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraManager) and 2 direct incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.ViewfinderResultPointCallback, com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The counts here are small. While CameraManager and CaptureActivity themselves reference many classes, those are not additional direct incoming/outgoing links of ViewfinderView in the provided data and therefore do not make ViewfinderView a hub."
