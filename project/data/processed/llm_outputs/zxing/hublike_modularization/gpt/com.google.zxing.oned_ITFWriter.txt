    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows only a single outgoing dependency and no incoming dependencies, so the smell is not present."
