    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Detector has many outgoing dependencies (15 distinct abstractions: ResultPointCallback, MathUtils, BitMatrix, PerspectiveTransform, NotFoundException, GridSampler, AlignmentPatternFinder, DecodeHintType, FinderPatternFinder, ResultPoint, FinderPattern, AlignmentPattern, Version, FinderPatternInfo, AlignmentPattern), but it has zero incoming dependencies in the provided data. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships; because there are no incoming dependencies, Detector does not meet the definition of a hub."
