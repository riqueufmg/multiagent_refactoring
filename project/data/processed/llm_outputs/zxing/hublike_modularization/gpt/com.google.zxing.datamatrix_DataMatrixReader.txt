    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. DataMatrixReader has 11 outgoing dependencies: com.google.zxing.common.DecoderResult, com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.DecodeHintType, com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.common.DetectorResult, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap, com.google.zxing.ResultMetadataType, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Decoder. However, it has 0 incoming dependencies. Because it lacks incoming dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub (which requires many both incoming and outgoing ties)."
