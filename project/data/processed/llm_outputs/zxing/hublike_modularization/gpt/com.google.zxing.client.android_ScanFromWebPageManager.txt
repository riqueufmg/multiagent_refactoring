    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ScanFromWebPageManager has only 2 outgoing direct dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.result.ResultHandler, com.google.zxing.Result) and only 1 incoming direct dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows a small number of direct relationships, so the smell is not detected. (Note: ResultHandler and Result themselves have many dependencies, but ScanFromWebPageManager's direct dependency counts are low.)"
