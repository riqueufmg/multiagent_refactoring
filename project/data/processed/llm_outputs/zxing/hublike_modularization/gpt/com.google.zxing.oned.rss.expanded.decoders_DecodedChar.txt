    "justification": "DecodedChar has no outgoing dependencies (empty dependencies list) and only a single incoming dependency (GeneralAppIdDecoder). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections; here there is minimal coupling (0 outgoing, 1 incoming), so it is not a hub."
