    "justification": "LuminanceSource has many incoming dependencies (10 distinct classes reference it: com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecodeWorker, com.google.zxing.client.j2se.GUIRunner, com.google.zxing.web.DecodeServlet, com.google.zxing.PlanarYUVLuminanceSource, com.google.zxing.GrayscaleLuminanceSource, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap, com.google.zxing.Binarizer, com.google.zxing.InvertedLuminanceSource, com.google.zxing.common.HybridBinarizer, com.google.zxing.common.GlobalHistogramBinarizer) but has zero outgoing dependencies. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; since outgoing dependencies are absent, the smell is not detected."
