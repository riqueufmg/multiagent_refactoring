    "justification": "com.google.zxing.Result acts as a central hub: it has a very large number of incoming dependencies from many distinct classes across packages (examples: com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecodeWorker, com.google.zxing.client.j2se.GUIRunner, com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity, com.google.zxing.MultiFormatReader, com.google.zxing.Reader, com.google.zxing.qrcode.QRCodeReader, com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader, com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Reader, numerous com.google.zxing.client.result.* parsers, etc.). Its outgoing dependencies include com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.ResultMetadataType and com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat. Many of the incoming classes also reference these outgoing abstractions, indicating Result both depends on and is depended on by a large set of other abstractions — matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
