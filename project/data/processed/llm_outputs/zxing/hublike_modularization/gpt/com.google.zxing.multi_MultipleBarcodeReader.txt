    "justification": "MultipleBarcodeReader has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap) and only two incoming dependents (com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecodeWorker, com.google.zxing.web.DecodeServlet). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction with many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided incoming/outgoing counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
