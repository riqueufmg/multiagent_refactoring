    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DetectionResult has 5 outgoing dependencies (DetectionResultColumn, PDF417Common, BarcodeMetadata, BoundingBox, Codeword) but only 1 incoming dependency (PDF417ScanningDecoder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both high fan-out and high fan-in (dependencies with a large number of other abstractions). The provided data shows modest outgoing coupling and minimal incoming coupling, so it does not qualify as a hub."
