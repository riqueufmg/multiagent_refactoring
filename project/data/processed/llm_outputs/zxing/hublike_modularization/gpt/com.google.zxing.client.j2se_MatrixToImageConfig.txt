    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. MatrixToImageConfig has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.client.j2se.MatrixToImageWriter). Because the class has no outgoing ties and only a single incoming reference, it does not meet the criteria for a hub."
