    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Code39Reader has outgoing dependencies to 7 abstractions (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.FormatException, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.ChecksumException, com.google.zxing.ResultMetadataType) but only a single incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.oned.Code39Writer). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both high incoming and high outgoing coupling. Here the incoming degree is low (1), so the class does not qualify as a hub."
