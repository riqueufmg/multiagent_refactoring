    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. WifiResultParser has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 2 outgoing dependencies: com.google.zxing.Result and com.google.zxing.client.result.WifiParsedResult. The absence of incoming links and the small number of outgoing links do not meet the 'hub-like' criteria."
