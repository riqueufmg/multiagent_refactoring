    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. BarcodeMetadata has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 3 incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResult). The absence of outgoing links and the small number of incoming references indicate this is not a hub-like module."
