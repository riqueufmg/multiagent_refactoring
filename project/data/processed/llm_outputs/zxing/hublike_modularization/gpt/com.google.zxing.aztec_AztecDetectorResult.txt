    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AztecDetectorResult has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix) and only 2 incoming dependents (com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecReader, com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder.Decoder). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; the observed counts and listed classes are small and do not indicate hub-like coupling."
