    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero outgoing dependencies (dependencies: []). It has only one incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.PDF417HighLevelEncoder). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and/or outgoing dependencies; here both counts are minimal, so the smell is not present."
