    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer.MinimalEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (to com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Reader). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; these counts do not meet that criterion. (Note: Code128Reader's multiple dependencies exist, but the analyzed class itself does not exhibit many incoming/outgoing links.)"
