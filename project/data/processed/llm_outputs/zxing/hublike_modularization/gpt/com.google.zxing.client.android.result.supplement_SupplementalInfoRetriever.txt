    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement.SupplementalInfoRetriever",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SupplementalInfoRetriever has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct abstractions (ProductResultInfoRetriever, BookResultInfoRetriever, TitleRetriever, URIResultInfoRetriever, ParsedResult, ProductParsedResult, HistoryManager) but has only a single incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing. Because the incoming coupling is minimal (one caller) despite multiple outgoing dependencies, this class does not meet the \"hub-like\" criterion."
