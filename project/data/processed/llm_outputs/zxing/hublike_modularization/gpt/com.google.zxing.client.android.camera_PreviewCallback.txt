    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.PreviewCallback",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PreviewCallback has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraConfigurationManager) and 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraManager). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; both counts here are low. Although CameraConfigurationManager itself depends on several classes, those are not direct dependencies of PreviewCallback and thus do not make PreviewCallback a hub."
