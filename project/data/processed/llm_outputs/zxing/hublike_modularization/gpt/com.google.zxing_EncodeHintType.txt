    "class": "com.google.zxing.EncodeHintType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "EncodeHintType has many incoming dependencies (10 distinct classes reference it: CommandLineEncoder, QRCodeEncoder, ChartServlet, Code128Writer, OneDimensionalCodeWriter, PDF417Writer, QRCodeWriter, Encoder (qrcode.encoder), DataMatrixWriter, AztecWriter) but has zero outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; since outgoing_dependencies = 0, the class does not meet the 'hub-like' criterion."
