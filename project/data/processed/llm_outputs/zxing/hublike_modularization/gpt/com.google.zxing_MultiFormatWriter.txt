    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (none). Outgoing dependencies: 3 (com.google.zxing.WriterException, com.google.zxing.Writer, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming dependencies are absent and the outgoing count is small, so the hub-like smell is not present."
