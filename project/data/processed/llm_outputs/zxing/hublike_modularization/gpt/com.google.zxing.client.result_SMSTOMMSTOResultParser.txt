    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.SMSTOMMSTOResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. SMSTOMMSTOResultParser has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (com.google.zxing.Result and com.google.zxing.client.result.SMSParsedResult) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Because it lacks incoming dependencies and the number of outgoing dependencies is small, it does not meet the hub-like modularization smell criteria."
