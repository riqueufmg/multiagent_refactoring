    "justification": "AddressBookAUResultParser has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.result.AddressBookParsedResult and com.google.zxing.Result). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows no incoming dependents and a small number of outgoing dependents, so the smell is not detected."
