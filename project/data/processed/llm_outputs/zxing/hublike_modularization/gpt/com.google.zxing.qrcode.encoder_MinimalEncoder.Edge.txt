    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Mode) and only one incoming dependency documented (com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MinimalEncoder). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows a single incoming and a single outgoing relation, so it does not qualify as a hub."
