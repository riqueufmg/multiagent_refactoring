    "justification": "LRUMap has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.web.DoSTracker). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows minimal coupling (incoming_count=1, outgoing_count=0), so this class is not a hub."
