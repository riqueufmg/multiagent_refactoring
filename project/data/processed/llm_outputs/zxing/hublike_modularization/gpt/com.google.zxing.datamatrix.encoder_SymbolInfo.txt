    "justification": "SymbolInfo has 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.SymbolShapeHint, com.google.zxing.Dimension) and 3 incoming dependents (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.DataMatrixWriter, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.EncoderContext, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.ErrorCorrection). These are small, localized dependency counts (mostly within the datamatrix package) and do not constitute the large number of incoming and outgoing relationships required to classify it as a hub-like module."
