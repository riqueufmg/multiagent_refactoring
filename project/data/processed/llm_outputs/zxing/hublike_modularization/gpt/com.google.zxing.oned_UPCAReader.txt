    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.UPCAReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "UPCAReader has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and therefore is not a hub. It has 6 direct outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.FormatException, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap, com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader), and some of those (BinaryBitmap, UPCEANReader) have multiple further dependencies, but the hub-like smell requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections. The absence of incoming dependencies disqualifies UPCAReader from being a hub-like module."
