Incoming dependencies (2): com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.RSSExpandedReader, com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.BitArrayBuilder. Total distinct connected abstractions = 4. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the counts here are small, so the smell is not detected."
