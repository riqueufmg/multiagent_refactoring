    "justification": "SmsAddressGenerator has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.StylesDefs, com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.GeneratorException, com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.Validators) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization is characterized by an abstraction having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (both incoming and outgoing); the provided data shows a low number of outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
