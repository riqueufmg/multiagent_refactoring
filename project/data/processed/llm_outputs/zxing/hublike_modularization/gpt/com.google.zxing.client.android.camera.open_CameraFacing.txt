    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CameraFacing has 0 outgoing dependencies (no references to other abstractions) and only 3 incoming dependencies (CameraConfigurationManager, OpenCameraInterface, OpenCamera). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; CameraFacing lacks outgoing dependencies and does not exhibit a large number of incoming/outgoing relationships."
