    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Code128Reader has outgoing dependencies to 8 distinct abstractions (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.FormatException, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.DecodeHintType, com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.ChecksumException, com.google.zxing.ResultMetadataType) but only 2 incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer and com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer.MinimalEncoder). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here the incoming coupling is low, so Code128Reader does not meet the hub-like smell criteria."
