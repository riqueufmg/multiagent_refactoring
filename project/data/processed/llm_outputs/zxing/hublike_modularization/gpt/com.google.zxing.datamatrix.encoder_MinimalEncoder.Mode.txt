    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.MinimalEncoder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections to other abstractions; this class does not exhibit those characteristics."
