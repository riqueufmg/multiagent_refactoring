    "justification": "This class has 6 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.BarcodeValue, com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Common, com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.BarcodeMetadata, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.BoundingBox, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.Codeword) but only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships; here the incoming dependency count is low, so it does not qualify as a hub."
