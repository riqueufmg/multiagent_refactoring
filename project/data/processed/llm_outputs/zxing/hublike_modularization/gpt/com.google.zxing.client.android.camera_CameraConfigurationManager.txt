    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraConfigurationManager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CameraConfigurationManager has 2 incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.PreviewCallback, com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraManager) and 5 outgoing dependencies (FrontLightMode, CameraConfigurationUtils, OpenCamera, CameraFacing, com.google.zxing.client.android.PreferencesActivity). The counts of incoming (2) and outgoing (5) dependencies are modest and the dependencies are closely related (camera utilities, camera/open classes, and preferences). There is no wide fan-in or fan-out across many unrelated abstractions, so it does not meet the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
