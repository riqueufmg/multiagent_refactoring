    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Detector has 9 outgoing dependencies (MathUtils; Detector.CorrectedParameter; BitMatrix; NotFoundException; GridSampler; GenericGF; ResultPoint; Detector.Point; ReedSolomonDecoder) but only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecReader). Several outgoing dependencies are internal/nested types (Detector.CorrectedParameter, Detector.Point) or common utility/exception classes (MathUtils, NotFoundException, BitMatrix, GridSampler, reedsolomon classes), which are typical and do not by themselves make the class a hub. Because incoming dependencies are not numerous, the class does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
