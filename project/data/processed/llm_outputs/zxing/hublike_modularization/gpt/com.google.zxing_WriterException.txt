    "justification": "com.google.zxing.WriterException has 0 outgoing dependencies and is referenced by 2 classes (com.google.zxing.Writer, com.google.zxing.MultiFormatWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class interacts with only two incoming references and no outgoing references, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
