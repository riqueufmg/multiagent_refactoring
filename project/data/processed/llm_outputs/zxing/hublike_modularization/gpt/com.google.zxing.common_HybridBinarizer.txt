    "justification": "HybridBinarizer has outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix and com.google.zxing.LuminanceSource (2 outgoing) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; since incoming dependencies = 0 and outgoing dependencies are only 2, this class does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
