    "justification": "UPCEWriter has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions: com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEReader, com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies; since incoming dependencies are absent and the outgoing set is small, the smell is not detected."
