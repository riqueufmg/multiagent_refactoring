    "justification": "ErrorCorrection does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization: it has only 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ModulusPoly, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ModulusGF, com.google.zxing.ChecksumException) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder). A hub-like module would have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows neither large incoming nor large outgoing connectivity for this class."
