    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.result.EmailDoCoMoResultParser, com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.client.result.EmailAddressParsedResult). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming count is zero and outgoing count is small, so it does not qualify."
