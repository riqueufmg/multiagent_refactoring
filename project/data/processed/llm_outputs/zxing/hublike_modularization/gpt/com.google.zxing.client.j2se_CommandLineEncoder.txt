    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.CommandLineEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions (MatrixToImageWriter, EncoderConfig, BitMatrix, EncodeHintType) but has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like modularization requires both high incoming and outgoing coupling; here incoming coupling is absent, so the smell is not present."
