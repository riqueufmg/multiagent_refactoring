    "justification": "VEventResultParser has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.client.result.VCardResultParser, com.google.zxing.client.result.CalendarParsedResult) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; the absence of incoming dependencies and the small number of outgoing links indicate this class is not a hub."
