    "justification": "CommandLineRunner has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecoderConfig, com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecodeWorker) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because incoming_dependencies is empty and the outgoing count is low, this class does not exhibit the hub-like smell."
