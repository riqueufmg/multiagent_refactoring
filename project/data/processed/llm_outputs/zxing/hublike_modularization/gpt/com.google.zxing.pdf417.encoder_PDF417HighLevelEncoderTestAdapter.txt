    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []), and only two outgoing dependencies (Compaction and PDF417HighLevelEncoder). Hub-like Modularization requires many both incoming and outgoing connections. Although PDF417HighLevelEncoder (one outgoing) has several dependencies itself, the analyzed class does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing links, so it is not a hub."
