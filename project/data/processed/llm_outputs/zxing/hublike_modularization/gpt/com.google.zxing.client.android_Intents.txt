    "justification": "Intents is referenced by many classes (13 incoming references: DecodeFormatManager, CaptureActivityHandler, CaptureActivity, HistoryManager, HistoryActivity, ResultHandler, EncodeActivity, QRCodeEncoder, ShareActivity, BookmarkPickerActivity, AppPickerActivity, SearchBookContentsActivity, BrowseBookListener), indicating high incoming coupling, but it has 0 outgoing dependencies. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many incoming AND many outgoing dependencies; because outgoing dependencies are absent, this class does not meet the definition and is not detected as hub-like."
