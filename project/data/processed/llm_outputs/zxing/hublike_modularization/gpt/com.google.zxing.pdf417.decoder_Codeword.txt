    "justification": "Codeword has 0 outgoing dependencies and 4 incoming dependencies (DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn, PDF417ScanningDecoder, DetectionResultColumn, DetectionResult). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here Codeword only has incoming links and no outgoing links, so it does not meet the hub-like smell criteria."
