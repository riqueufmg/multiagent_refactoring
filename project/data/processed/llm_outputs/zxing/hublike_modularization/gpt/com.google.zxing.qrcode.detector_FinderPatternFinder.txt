    "justification": "FinderPatternFinder has 8 outgoing dependencies (ResultPointCallback, BitMatrix, NotFoundException, DecodeHintType, ResultPoint, FinderPattern, FinderPatternFinder.EstimatedModuleComparator, FinderPatternInfo) but only 1 incoming dependency (Detector). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have large numbers of both incoming and outgoing links; here the incoming coupling is minimal, so it does not qualify as a hub."
