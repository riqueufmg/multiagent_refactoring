    "justification": "HighLevelEncoder has many outgoing dependencies (EncoderContext, Dimension, Encoder, C40Encoder, SymbolShapeHint) and is depended on by many other classes (incoming from DataMatrixWriter, MinimalEncoder, EdifactEncoder, ASCIIEncoder, Base256Encoder, C40Encoder, X12Encoder, TextEncoder). There is also a mutual/cyclic dependency with C40Encoder (HighLevelEncoder -> C40Encoder and C40Encoder -> HighLevelEncoder). The presence of numerous distinct incoming and outgoing links indicates Hub-like Modularization."
