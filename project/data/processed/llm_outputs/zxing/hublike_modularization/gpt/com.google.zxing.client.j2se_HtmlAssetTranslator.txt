    "justification": "HtmlAssetTranslator has 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.client.j2se.StringsResourceTranslator) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and outgoing). The observed counts (outgoing=1, incoming=0) are far below what defines a hub, so the smell is not detected."
