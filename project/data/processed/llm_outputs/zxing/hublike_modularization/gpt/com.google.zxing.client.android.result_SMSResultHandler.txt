    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires many both incoming and outgoing dependencies. SMSResultHandler has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.result.ParsedResult, com.google.zxing.client.result.SMSParsedResult). With no incoming links and a small number of outgoing links, it does not exhibit a hub-like coupling pattern."
