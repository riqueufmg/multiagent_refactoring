    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and 4 incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.result.ResultHandler, com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.EncodeActivity, com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.QRCodeEncoder, com.google.zxing.client.android.share.ShareActivity). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here there are multiple incoming links but no outgoing links, so the hub-like smell is not present."
