    "justification": "DecoderConfig has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.DecodeHintType, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat) and only 2 incoming dependents (com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecodeWorker, com.google.zxing.client.j2se.CommandLineRunner). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; the observed counts are small, so this is not a hub."
