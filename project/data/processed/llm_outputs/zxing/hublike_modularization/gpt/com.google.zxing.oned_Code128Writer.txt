    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Code128Writer has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 6 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer.Latch, com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer.CType, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer.Charset, com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Reader, com.google.zxing.EncodeHintType). Although one outgoing target (Code128Reader) itself depends on many classes, Code128Writer does not exhibit both a large number of incoming and outgoing ties; therefore it is not a hub-like module."
