    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.FinderPatternFinder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; these counts (incoming=1, outgoing=0) do not meet that criterion."
