    "justification": "Not detected: OneDimensionalCodeWriter has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.EncodeHintType, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming dependencies are absent and outgoing dependencies are few, so the smell is not present."
