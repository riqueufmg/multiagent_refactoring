    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. GeoLocationGenerator has 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.StylesDefs, com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.GeneratorException) and 0 incoming dependencies. Because it lacks incoming dependencies and the dependency counts are low, it does not qualify as a hub."
