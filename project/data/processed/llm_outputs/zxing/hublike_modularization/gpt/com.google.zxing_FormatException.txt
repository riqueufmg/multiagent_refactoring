    "class": "com.google.zxing.FormatException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FormatException has many incoming dependencies (24 classes reference it, e.g. com.google.zxing.Reader, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Decoder, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder, com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader, com.google.zxing.common.ECIStringBuilder, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser, etc.) but has zero outgoing dependencies (no dependencies declared). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because outgoing dependencies are absent, the condition for a hub-like module is not met."
