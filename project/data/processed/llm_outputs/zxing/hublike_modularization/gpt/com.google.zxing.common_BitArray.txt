    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.BitArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BitArray has a large number of incoming dependencies (44 distinct classes across multiple packages depend on it, e.g. com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap, com.google.zxing.Binarizer, many oned/rssexpanded readers, qrcode/aztec encoders), but it has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here only incoming connections are numerous while outgoing connections are zero, so the smell is not detected."
