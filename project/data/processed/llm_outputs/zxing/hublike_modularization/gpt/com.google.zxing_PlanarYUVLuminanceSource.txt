    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.LuminanceSource) and only 1 incoming dependent class (com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeHandler). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing counts are low."
