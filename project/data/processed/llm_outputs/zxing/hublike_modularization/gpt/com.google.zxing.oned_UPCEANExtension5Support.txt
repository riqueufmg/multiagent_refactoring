    "justification": "UPCEANExtension5Support has 6 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.ResultMetadataType, com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader) but only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANExtensionSupport). The class does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing ties to other abstractions, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
