    "justification": "TimeZoneInfo has only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.TimeZoneList) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing). The provided data (incoming_dependencies: [TimeZoneList]; outgoing_dependencies: []) does not meet that criterion."
