    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. HistoryActivity has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.Intents, com.google.zxing.client.android.history.HistoryItemAdapter, com.google.zxing.client.android.history.HistoryManager). Because there are no incoming links and the number of outgoing links is small, this class does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
