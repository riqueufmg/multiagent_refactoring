    "justification": "PDF417ErrorCorrection has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.PDF417). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows neither a large number of incoming nor any outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
