    "justification": "ReedSolomonEncoder has only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.Encoder) and 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.GenericGFPoly, com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.GenericGF). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; the provided counts (1 incoming, 2 outgoing) do not constitute a large number, so the smell is not detected."
