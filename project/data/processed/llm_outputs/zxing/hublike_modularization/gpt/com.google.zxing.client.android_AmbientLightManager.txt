    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.AmbientLightManager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AmbientLightManager has only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.FrontLightMode, com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraManager) and a single incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity). The number of both incoming and outgoing direct relationships is small, so it does not meet the definition of a hub-like abstraction. Note: CameraManager has many of its own dependencies, but AmbientLightManager's direct coupling remains limited to two classes and one caller."
