    "justification": "CaptureActivity has a large number of both outgoing and incoming relationships: 23 outgoing dependencies (examples: com.google.zxing.Result, CameraManager, CaptureActivityHandler, InactivityTimer, HistoryManager, DecodeFormatManager, ViewfinderView, BeepManager, AmbientLightManager, DecodeHintManager, ResultHandlerFactory, ScanFromWebPageManager, PreferencesActivity, ClipboardInterface, IntentSource, BarcodeFormat, ResultPoint, ResultMetadataType, SupplementalInfoRetriever, HistoryItem) and 5 incoming dependencies from other classes referencing it (CaptureActivityHandler, DecodeThread, DecodeHandler, ResultHandlerFactory, WifiResultHandler). The total number of distinct collaborating abstractions (28) and the presence of many varied responsibilities (camera, UI viewfinder, result handling, history, preferences, ambient light, clipboard, beep/sound, decode format/hints) indicate CaptureActivity functions as a hub-like module, showing the Hub-like Modularization smell."
