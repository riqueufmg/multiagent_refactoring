    "justification": "DataBlock has a single outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Version) and a single incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Decoder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and many outgoing). The provided data shows only one incoming and one outgoing relationship, so the smell is not present."
