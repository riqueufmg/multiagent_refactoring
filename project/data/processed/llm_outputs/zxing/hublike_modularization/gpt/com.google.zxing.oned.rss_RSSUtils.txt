    "justification": "RSSUtils has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependents (com.google.zxing.oned.rss.RSS14Reader, com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.RSSExpandedReader). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; RSSUtils lacks outgoing dependencies and has a small number of incoming dependents. While the incoming classes themselves reference many other types, that does not make RSSUtils a hub."
