    "justification": "Not detected: Code93Writer has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.oned.Code93Reader, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat). Although one outgoing dependency (Code93Reader) itself references several other types, the analyzed class in isolation does not have a large number of direct incoming and outgoing connections required for Hub-like Modularization."
