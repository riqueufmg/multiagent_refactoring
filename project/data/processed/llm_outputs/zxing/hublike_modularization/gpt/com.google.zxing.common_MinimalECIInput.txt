    "justification": "MinimalECIInput has 0 incoming dependencies and 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.common.MinimalECIInput.InputEdge, com.google.zxing.common.ECIEncoderSet). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections. Because there are no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing links, the hub-like smell is not present. (Note: ECIEncoderSet itself depends on com.google.zxing.common.CharacterSetECI, but that does not create incoming dependencies on MinimalECIInput.)"
