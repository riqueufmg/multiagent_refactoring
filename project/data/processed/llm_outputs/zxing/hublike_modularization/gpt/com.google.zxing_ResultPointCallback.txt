    "justification": "ResultPointCallback is depended on by many distinct classes (9 incoming): com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeThread, com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader, com.google.zxing.oned.rss.RSS14Reader, com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector.MultiDetector, com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector.MultiFinderPatternFinder, com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.FinderPatternFinder, com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.AlignmentPatternFinder, com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.Detector, and com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecReader. It also has an outgoing dependency to com.google.zxing.ResultPoint. The class therefore has both incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions (9 incoming, 1 outgoing) and functions as a central hub connecting multiple detectors/readers to ResultPoint, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
