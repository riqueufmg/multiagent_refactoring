    "justification": "PDF417CodewordDecoder has only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder) and 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Common, com.google.zxing.common.detector.MathUtils). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; the provided counts (incoming=1, outgoing=2) are low, so the smell is not present."
