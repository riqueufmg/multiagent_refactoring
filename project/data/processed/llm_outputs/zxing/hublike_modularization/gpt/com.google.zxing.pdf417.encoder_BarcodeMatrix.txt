    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 1 (com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.BarcodeRow). Incoming dependencies: 1 (com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.PDF417). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; BarcodeMatrix has only one incoming and one outgoing dependency, so it is not a hub."
