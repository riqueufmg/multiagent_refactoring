    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ResultPoint has a large number of incoming dependencies (32 distinct incoming classes reference it, e.g. com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity, com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.Detector, com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.detector.Detector), but only a single outgoing dependency (1) to com.google.zxing.common.detector.MathUtils. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires many incoming AND many outgoing dependencies; ResultPoint lacks the required multiplicity of outgoing dependencies, so it is not detected as hub-like."
