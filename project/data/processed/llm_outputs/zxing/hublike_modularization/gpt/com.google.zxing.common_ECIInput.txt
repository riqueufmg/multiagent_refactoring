    "justification": "ECIInput has 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.PDF417HighLevelEncoder) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows minimal connectivity, so this is not a hub."
