    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies (6): com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.DecodeHintType, com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.ResultMetadataType. Incoming dependencies (1): com.google.zxing.oned.CodaBarWriter. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing are moderate (6) but incoming is minimal (1), so the class does not qualify as a hub."
