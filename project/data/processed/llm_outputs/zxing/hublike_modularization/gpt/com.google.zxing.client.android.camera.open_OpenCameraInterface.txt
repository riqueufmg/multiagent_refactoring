    "justification": "OpenCameraInterface has only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraManager) and 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open.CameraFacing, com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open.OpenCamera). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the counts here are low, so the smell is not detected."
