    "justification": "EncodeActivity has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.Intents, com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.QRCodeEncoder, com.google.zxing.client.android.Contents). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing links; here EncodeActivity lacks incoming links and has a small number of outgoing links, so the smell is not detected."
