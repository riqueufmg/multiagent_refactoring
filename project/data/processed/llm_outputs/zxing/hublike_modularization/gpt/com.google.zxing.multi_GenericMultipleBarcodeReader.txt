    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. This class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 5 outgoing dependencies: com.google.zxing.Reader, com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.ResultPoint, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap. Because there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing dependency count is not exceptionally large, the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
