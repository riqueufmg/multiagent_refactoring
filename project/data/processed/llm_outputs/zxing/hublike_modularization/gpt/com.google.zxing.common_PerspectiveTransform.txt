    "justification": "PerspectiveTransform has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies: []) and 3 incoming dependencies (DefaultGridSampler, GridSampler, Detector). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here only incoming dependencies exist and outgoing are absent, so the smell is not detected."
