    "class": "com.google.zxing.MultiFormatReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MultiFormatReader has 6 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.Reader, com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.DecodeHintType, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap) and only 2 incoming dependents (com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecodeWorker, com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeHandler). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here the outgoing degree is moderate (6) but the incoming degree is low (2), so the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
