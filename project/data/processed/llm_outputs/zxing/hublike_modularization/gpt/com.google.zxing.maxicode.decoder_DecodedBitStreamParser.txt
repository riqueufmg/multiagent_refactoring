    "justification": "Analyzed in isolation, DecodedBitStreamParser has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.FormatException) and only 1 incoming dependency (referenced by com.google.zxing.maxicode.decoder.Decoder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows minimal inbound/outbound connections, so this is not a hub."
