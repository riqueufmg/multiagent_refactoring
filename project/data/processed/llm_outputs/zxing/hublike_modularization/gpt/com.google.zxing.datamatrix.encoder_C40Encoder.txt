    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.C40Encoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "C40Encoder has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.HighLevelEncoder, com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.EncoderContext) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.HighLevelEncoder). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; the provided dependency counts are low. Note: HighLevelEncoder depends on many classes, but those do not create additional incoming dependencies to C40Encoder in the given data."
