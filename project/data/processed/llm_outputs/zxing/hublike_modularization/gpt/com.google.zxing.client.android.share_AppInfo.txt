    "justification": "The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization because it has no incoming or outgoing dependencies: incoming_dependencies = 0, outgoing_dependencies = 0 (both arrays are empty). The analyzed_package.dependencies array is also empty, so there are no many-to-many dependency relationships."
