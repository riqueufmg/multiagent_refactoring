    "justification": "ECIEncoderSet has only 2 incoming dependencies (com.google.zxing.common.MinimalECIInput, com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MinimalEncoder) and 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.common.CharacterSetECI). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; the observed counts (incoming=2, outgoing=1) are low, so the smell is not detected."
