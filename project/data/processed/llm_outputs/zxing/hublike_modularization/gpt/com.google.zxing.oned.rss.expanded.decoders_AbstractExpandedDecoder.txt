    "justification": "Direct outgoing dependencies: 2 (com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.GeneralAppIdDecoder, com.google.zxing.common.BitArray). Direct incoming dependencies: 1 (com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.RSSExpandedReader). Both incoming and outgoing connection counts are low, so the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization (it is not connected to a large number of other abstractions)."
