    "justification": "ProductResultHandler has 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.result.ParsedResult, com.google.zxing.Result) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has a low number of outgoing links and no incoming links, so the hub-like smell is not present."
