    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DecodeHandler has only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeThread) and 6 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.PlanarYUVLuminanceSource, com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity, com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeThread, com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap, com.google.zxing.MultiFormatReader). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; the incoming count is minimal and the outgoing count is modest, so the class is not a hub."
