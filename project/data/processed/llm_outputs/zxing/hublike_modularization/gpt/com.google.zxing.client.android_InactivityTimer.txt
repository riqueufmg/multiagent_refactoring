    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.InactivityTimer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "InactivityTimer has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.android.InactivityTimer.PowerStatusReceiver, com.google.zxing.client.android.InactivityTimer.InactivityAsyncTask) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity). Because hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, the provided data (2 outgoing, 1 incoming) does not meet that criterion."
