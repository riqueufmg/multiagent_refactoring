    "justification": "PDF417Writer has 6 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.Compaction, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.Dimensions, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat, com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.PDF417, com.google.zxing.EncodeHintType) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies means PDF417Writer is not a hub."
