    "justification": "MatrixToImageWriter has only 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.client.j2se.MatrixToImageConfig, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.common.BitArray) and is referenced by 2 incoming classes (com.google.zxing.client.j2se.CommandLineEncoder, com.google.zxing.web.ChartServlet). Hub-like Modularization denotes an abstraction with dependencies to and from a large number of other abstractions; the provided data show a small number of incoming (2) and outgoing (3) relationships, so this class does not meet the hub-like threshold."
