    "justification": "ModulusGF has outgoing dependencies to com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ModulusPoly and com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Common (2 outgoing). It has incoming dependencies from com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ErrorCorrection and com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ModulusPoly (2 incoming). A hub-like modularization implies dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the dependency counts are low and limited (2 each), with only one mutual dependency (ModulusPoly), so it does not qualify as a hub."
