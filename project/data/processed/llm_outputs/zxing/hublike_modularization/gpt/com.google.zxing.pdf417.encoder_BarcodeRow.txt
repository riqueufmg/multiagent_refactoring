    "justification": "BarcodeRow has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has incoming dependencies from two classes (PDF417 and BarcodeMatrix), but a hub requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships. With 0 outgoing and only 2 incoming, this does not meet the Hub-like Modularization criteria."
