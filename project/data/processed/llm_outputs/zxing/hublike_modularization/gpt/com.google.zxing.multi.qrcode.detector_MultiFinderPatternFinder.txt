    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector.MultiFinderPatternFinder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MultiFinderPatternFinder has 7 outgoing dependencies (ResultPointCallback, BitMatrix, NotFoundException, DecodeHintType, ResultPoint, FinderPattern, FinderPatternInfo) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector.MultiDetector). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing. Here the incoming dependency count is minimal (1), so the class does not act as a hub."
