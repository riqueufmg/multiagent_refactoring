    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.client.result.ExpandedProductParsedResult, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections; with zero incoming and only three outgoing (a small number), this class does not exhibit the hub-like smell."
