    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited to 2 abstractions: com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.ExpandedPair and com.google.zxing.common.BitArray. Incoming dependencies consist of a single abstraction: com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.RSSExpandedReader. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming (1) and outgoing (2) counts are small, so the smell is not detected."
