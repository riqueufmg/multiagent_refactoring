    "justification": "GeneratorSource has only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.Generator) and 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.GeneratorException). A hub-like modularization requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; these counts are minimal and do not meet that criterion."
