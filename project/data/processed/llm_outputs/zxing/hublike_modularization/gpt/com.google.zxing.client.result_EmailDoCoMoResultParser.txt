    "justification": "EmailDoCoMoResultParser has 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.client.result.EmailAddressParsedResult) and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.client.result.EmailAddressResultParser). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; these counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
