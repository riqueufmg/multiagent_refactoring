    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.BlockParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BlockParsedResult has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.DecodedInformation) and only 1 incoming dependency (used by com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.GeneralAppIdDecoder). The total number of distinct incoming/outgoing connections is low; therefore it does not meet the \"hub-like\" criterion. Note: GeneralAppIdDecoder itself depends on many classes, but that reflects its role, not that BlockParsedResult is a hub."
