    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Version.ECBlocks, com.google.zxing.FormatException) and 3 incoming dependents (Decoder, DataBlock, BitMatrixParser). These counts are small and show limited coupling rather than many incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization."
