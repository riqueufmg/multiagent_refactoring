    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: the class has a single outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix) and only two incoming dependents (com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Reader and com.google.zxing.pdf417.detector.Detector). Although the incoming classes themselves reference many other types, the analyzed class interacts directly with a small number of abstractions and therefore does not exhibit hub-like coupling."
