    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.client.result.ParsedResultType) and 4 incoming dependencies (EmailAddressResultHandler, EmailAddressResultParser, SMTPResultParser, EmailDoCoMoResultParser). The outgoing count is minimal and the incoming set is small and limited to related parsers/handlers, so the criteria for a hub-like module are not met."
