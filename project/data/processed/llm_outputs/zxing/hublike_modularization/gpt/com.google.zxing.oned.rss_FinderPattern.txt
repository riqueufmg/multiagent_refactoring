    "justification": "Incoming: 4 classes depend on FinderPattern (com.google.zxing.oned.rss.RSS14Reader, com.google.zxing.oned.rss.Pair, com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.RSSExpandedReader, com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.ExpandedPair). Outgoing: FinderPattern depends on 1 class (com.google.zxing.ResultPoint). Because FinderPattern has several incoming dependents but only a single outgoing dependency, it does not have the many-to-many incoming/outgoing coupling characteristic of a hub-like modularization."
