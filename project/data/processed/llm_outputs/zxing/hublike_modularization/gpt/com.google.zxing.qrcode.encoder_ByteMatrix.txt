    "justification": "ByteMatrix has 6 incoming dependencies (QRCodeWriter, Encoder, MaskUtil, MatrixUtil, QRCode, DataMatrixWriter) but 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires substantial both incoming and outgoing coupling with many other abstractions; here outgoing coupling is absent, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
