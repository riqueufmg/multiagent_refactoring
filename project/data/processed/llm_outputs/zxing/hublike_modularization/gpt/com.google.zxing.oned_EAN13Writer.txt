    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: EAN13Writer has only 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.oned.EAN13Reader, com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat) and 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.oned.UPCAWriter). A hub-like modularization would show a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; the direct coupling counts here are low. Note: although one outgoing target (UPCEANReader) has many of its own dependencies, EAN13Writer's direct incoming/outgoing links remain limited."
