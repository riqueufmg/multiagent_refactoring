    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.MinimalEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MinimalEncoder has outgoing dependencies to 6 abstractions (MinimalEncoder.Mode, MinimalEncoder.Input, SymbolShapeHint, HighLevelEncoder, MinimalEncoder.Result, MinimalEncoder.Edge) but only 2 incoming dependents are recorded (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.DataMatrixWriter and MinimalEncoder.Result). One incoming dependent is the nested Result type (internal), leaving a single external incoming dependent (DataMatrixWriter). The number of incoming dependents is small and there are not many distinct external bidirectional links, so this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
