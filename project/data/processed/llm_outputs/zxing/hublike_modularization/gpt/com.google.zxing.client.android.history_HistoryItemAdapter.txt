    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.history.HistoryItemAdapter",

    "justification": "HistoryItemAdapter has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.Result, com.google.zxing.client.android.history.HistoryItem) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.client.android.history.HistoryActivity). The counts of incoming and outgoing relations are low, so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
