    "justification": "Not detected: EAN13Reader has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.common.BitArray, com.google.zxing.NotFoundException, com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat) and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.oned.EAN13Writer). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions; the provided counts are small and do not indicate a hub."
