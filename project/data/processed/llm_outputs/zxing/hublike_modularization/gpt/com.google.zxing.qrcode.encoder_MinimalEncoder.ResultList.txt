    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MinimalEncoder.ResultList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MinimalEncoder.ResultList has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Version, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Mode) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MinimalEncoder). These are low counts and do not represent an abstraction with a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships, so the hub-like modularization smell is not present."
