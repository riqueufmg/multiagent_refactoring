    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.BitMatrixParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BitMatrixParser has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Version, com.google.zxing.FormatException, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Decoder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; here the incoming dependency count is low and the outgoing set is small, so it does not qualify as a hub."
