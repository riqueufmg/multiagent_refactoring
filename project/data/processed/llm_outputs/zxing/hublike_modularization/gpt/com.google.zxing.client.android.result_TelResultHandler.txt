    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (none). Outgoing dependencies: 2 (com.google.zxing.client.result.TelParsedResult, com.google.zxing.client.result.ParsedResult). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; TelResultHandler has no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing dependencies, so it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
