{
    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.multi",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and a total of 176 LOC, which is modest. The largest class, GenericMultipleBarcodeReader, is 103 LOC (wmc 24) while the others are 64 LOC and 9 LOC — no single class or the package as a whole is disproportionately large. The class count and LOC do not indicate an excessively large component, so the God Component smell is not detected."
