    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Package contains two excessively large classes (DecodedBitStreamParser with 479 LOC/115 WMC and PDF417ScanningDecoder with 455 LOC/108 WMC) that dominate the package's total 1750 LOC. These classes have high method counts (8 and 25 respectively) and complexity metrics, with DecodedBitStreamParser also having 30 fields, indicating they likely handle too many responsibilities. The package as a whole shows significant concentration of complexity in few components."
