    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes and 1072 lines of code, which is not excessively large. While one class (FinderPatternFinder) is substantial (536 lines), the overall package size and class count are within reasonable bounds for a dedicated QR code detection module, and the package does not exhibit disproportionate growth in size or complexity."
