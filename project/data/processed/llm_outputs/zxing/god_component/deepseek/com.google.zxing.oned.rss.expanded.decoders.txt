    "justification": "The package has 21 classes and 1080 LOC, which are moderate for a specialized decoding module in a library. No single class or the aggregate size appears excessively large relative to the functional responsibility of decoding RSS expanded barcodes. The largest class (GeneralAppIdDecoder) has 350 LOC but is balanced by many small, focused classes."
