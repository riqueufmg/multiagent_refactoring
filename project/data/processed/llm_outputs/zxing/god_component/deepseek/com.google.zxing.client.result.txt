    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 37 classes and 2296 LOC, which is moderate for a library component handling multiple barcode result types. Classes are small, focused, and follow a consistent pattern (parser and result pairs), indicating modular design and high cohesion. Coupling metrics (Ce=2, Ca=6) are low, and the size is appropriate for the domain of parsing diverse barcode formats."
