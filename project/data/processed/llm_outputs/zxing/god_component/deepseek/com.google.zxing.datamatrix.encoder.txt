    "justification": "The package contains 19 classes and 2409 LOC, with one class (MinimalEncoder) dominating at 614 LOC plus its nested classes totaling over 1000 LOC. The component handles multiple distinct responsibilities (multiple encoders, symbol info, error correction, placement) and shows high internal complexity and size, indicating excessive breadth and lack of modularity."
