    "justification": "The package contains 11 classes with 714 total LOC, which is moderate in size for an encoding module. Individual class sizes are reasonable (largest class has 266 LOC), and the module shows clear separation of concerns with distinct encoder implementations and formatters without excessive centralization of functionality."
