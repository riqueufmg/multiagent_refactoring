    "justification": "The package contains 11 classes and 1641 LOC, which is moderate for a dedicated QR encoding module. The largest class (Encoder, 434 LOC) and other core classes (MinimalEncoder, 382 LOC; MatrixUtil, 226 LOC) are focused on distinct responsibilities, and the overall size is reasonable given the complex encoding functionality."
