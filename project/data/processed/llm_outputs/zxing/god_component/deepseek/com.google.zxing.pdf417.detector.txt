    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package has only 2 classes and 284 LOC, which is moderate. The Detector class, while substantial (259 LOC, 9 methods, 13 fields), is the main logic for PDF417 detection and does not appear excessively large for its specialized role. The second class is minimal. The package's limited scope and manageable size don't indicate a God Component."
