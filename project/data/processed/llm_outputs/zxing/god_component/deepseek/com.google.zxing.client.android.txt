    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 33 classes and 2328 lines of code, which is substantial but not excessively large for the main Android client component of the ZXing library, given its focused responsibility of barcode scanning and related functionality. The classes are mostly small to medium in size with a clear separation of concerns, and the overall structure does not indicate an overwhelming concentration of logic or dependencies beyond typical Android activity and helper classes."
