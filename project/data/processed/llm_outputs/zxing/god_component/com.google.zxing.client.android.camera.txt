    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package concentrates a large amount of code and complexity in a small number of classes: total package LOC = 881 across 7 classes, with CameraConfigurationUtils (344 LOC, WMC=71, nom=21) and CameraManager (245 LOC, WMC=38, nom=14) dominating the package size and complexity. CameraConfigurationManager is also sizeable (156 LOC). The high LOC and WMC values indicate large, complex classes that centralize behavior, i.e. responsibilities are concentrated rather than distributed. Low external coupling (Ce=2, Ca=2) further suggests functionality is bundled inside this package rather than delegated, supporting the detection of a God Component."
