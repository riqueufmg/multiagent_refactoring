    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (num_classes = 1) whose size equals the whole package (loc = 249). The Detector class itself has loc = 249, a high complexity (wmc = 32) and a relatively large number of methods (nom = 11), indicating many responsibilities concentrated in one type. Package-level coupling (Ce = 3, Ca = 3) and the class dependencies (several core detector/common classes) suggest this component plays a central role. Together, the concentrated LOC, high method/complexity counts, and single-class composition support that this package functions as a God Component."
