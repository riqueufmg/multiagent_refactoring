    "justification": "The package contains 11 classes with a total of 1641 lines of code. While the package has a moderate size, the functionality appears to be well-distributed among specialized classes such as Encoder, MinimalEncoder, MatrixUtil, and MaskUtil, each handling distinct responsibilities within QR code encoding. No single class dominates the codebase in terms of lines of code or complexity, and the dependencies suggest a reasonable division of concerns."
