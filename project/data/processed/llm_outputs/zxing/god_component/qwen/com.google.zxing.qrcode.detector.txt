    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with a total of 1072 lines of code. The largest class, FinderPatternFinder, has 536 lines of code and 22 methods, which is significant but not excessively large in the context of its responsibilities. The package and its classes appear to be well-organized around QR code detection functionality, without clear evidence of excessive size or responsibility concentration that would indicate a God Component."
