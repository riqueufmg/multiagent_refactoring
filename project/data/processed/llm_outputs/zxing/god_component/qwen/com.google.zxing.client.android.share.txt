    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.share",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes with a total of 378 lines of code. The largest class, ShareActivity, has 184 lines of code and a WMC of 36, which is relatively high but not excessive in the context of an Android activity handling multiple responsibilities such as UI management, event handling, and integration with external components. Other classes are significantly smaller, indicating a reasonable distribution of responsibilities. The package does not exhibit an excessive concentration of logic or responsibilities that would characterize a God Component."
