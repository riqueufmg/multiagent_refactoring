    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 176 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, GenericMultipleBarcodeReader, has 103 lines of code and a WMC of 24, which is reasonable for its functionality. The distribution of responsibilities appears appropriate, with no single class dominating the package in terms of complexity or size."
