    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 21 classes with a total of 1080 lines of code. While the GeneralAppIdDecoder class is relatively large (350 LOC, WMC 102), the overall distribution of responsibilities appears to be reasonably modular, with most classes being small and focused. The package does not exhibit excessive centralization of functionality or an overwhelming number of classes that would indicate a God Component."
