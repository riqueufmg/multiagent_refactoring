    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 11 classes with a total of 714 lines of code. The largest class, QRCodeEncoder, has 266 lines of code and a WMC of 57, which is substantial but not excessively large in the context of its responsibilities. Other classes are significantly smaller, indicating a reasonable distribution of functionality. There is no single class or component that dominates the codebase in terms of size or complexity to qualify as a God Component."
