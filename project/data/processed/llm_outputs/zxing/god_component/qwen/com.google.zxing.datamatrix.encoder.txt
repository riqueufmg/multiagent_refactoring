    "justification": "The package contains 19 classes with a total of 2409 lines of code. While the package has a moderate number of classes and a substantial LOC, the classes are logically grouped under the DataMatrix encoding functionality. Key classes like MinimalEncoder (614 LOC), HighLevelEncoder (371 LOC), and ErrorCorrection (109 LOC) handle specific responsibilities without excessive centralization. No single class dominates the package in terms of complexity or dependencies, indicating a reasonable distribution of responsibilities."
