    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 82 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, OpenCameraInterface, has 51 lines of code and 2 methods, which also does not indicate excessive size or complexity. There is no evidence of a single component taking on too many responsibilities."
