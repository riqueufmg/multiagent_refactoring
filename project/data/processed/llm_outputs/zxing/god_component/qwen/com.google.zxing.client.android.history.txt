    "package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.history",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 5 classes with a total of 390 lines of code. The largest class, HistoryManager, has 200 lines of code and 13 methods, which is substantial but not excessively large in the context of an Android component managing history functionality. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable, with dedicated classes for items (HistoryItem), database handling (DBHelper), UI presentation (HistoryItemAdapter), and activity management (HistoryActivity). There is no indication of excessive centralization of logic or responsibilities within a single class or package-level component."
