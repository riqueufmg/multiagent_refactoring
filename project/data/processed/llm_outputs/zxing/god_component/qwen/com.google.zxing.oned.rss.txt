    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes with a total of 609 lines of code. The largest class, RSS14Reader, has 362 lines of code and a WMC of 73, which indicates complexity but not excessively so given its role as a reader implementation. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable across the classes, with no single class dominating the package in terms of functionality or dependencies. The package does not exhibit signs of excessive size or centralization of logic that would characterize a God Component."
