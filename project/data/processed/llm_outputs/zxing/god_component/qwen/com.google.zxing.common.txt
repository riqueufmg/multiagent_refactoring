    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 17 classes with a total of 2224 lines of code. While the LOC is moderately high, it is distributed across multiple cohesive classes, each with focused responsibilities. The largest class, BitMatrix, has 442 LOC and 89 WMC, which is substantial but not excessively large in the context of its functionality. No single class dominates the package in terms of complexity or LOC, indicating that the code is reasonably modular and does not exhibit the characteristics of a God Component."
