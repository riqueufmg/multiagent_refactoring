    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only one class (Detector) with 249 lines of code. While the class has a substantial size, it is not excessively large given its role as a detector component. The package has low afferent (0) and efferent (3) coupling, indicating focused responsibility. The class encapsulates detector-specific logic with reasonable complexity (WMC=32, NOM=11), suggesting cohesive design rather than god component characteristics."
