    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 24 classes with a total of 1265 lines of code, which is not excessively large for a core library package. The classes are reasonably modular, with clear separation of concerns (e.g., exceptions, data structures, interfaces, and implementations). No single class dominates the package in terms of complexity or lines of code. The package serves as a foundational module for the ZXing library, and its size is contextually appropriate for its role."
