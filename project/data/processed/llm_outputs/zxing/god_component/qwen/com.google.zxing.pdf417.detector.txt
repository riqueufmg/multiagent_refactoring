    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a total of 284 lines of code. The largest class, Detector, has 259 lines of code and 9 methods, which is not excessively large given its responsibility for PDF417 detection logic. The package structure and class sizes are reasonable for the functionality implemented."
