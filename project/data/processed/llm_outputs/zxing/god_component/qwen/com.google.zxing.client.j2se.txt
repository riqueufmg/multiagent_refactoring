    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 12 classes with a total of 1030 lines of code, which is not excessively large for a package. The classes are functionally cohesive, handling various aspects of ZXing's Java SE client functionality such as image processing, decoding, encoding, and UI components. No single class dominates the package in terms of responsibilities or LOC. The distribution of lines of code and responsibilities across multiple classes indicates a reasonable separation of concerns rather than a god component."
