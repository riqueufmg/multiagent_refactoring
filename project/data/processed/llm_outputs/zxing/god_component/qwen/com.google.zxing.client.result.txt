    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 37 classes with a total of 2296 lines of code. While the number of classes is relatively high, the classes appear to be well-organized and focused on specific parsing and result-handling tasks related to barcode client results. The average lines of code per class is moderate, and there is no single class that dominates the codebase in terms of size or complexity. The package seems to follow a cohesive design pattern centered around parsing different types of barcode results, which justifies the number of classes without indicating a God Component smell."
