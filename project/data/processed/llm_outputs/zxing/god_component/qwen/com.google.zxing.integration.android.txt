{
    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.integration.android",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a total of 380 lines of code. The largest class, IntentIntegrator, has 325 lines of code and 34 methods, which is not excessively large given its role in handling Android integration logic for ZXing. The second class, IntentResult, is small with 55 lines of code and 8 methods. The overall package size and class sizes are reasonable for their functionality and do not indicate a God Component smell."
