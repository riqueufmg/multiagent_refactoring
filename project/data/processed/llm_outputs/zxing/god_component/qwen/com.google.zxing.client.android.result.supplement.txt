    "justification": "The package contains 5 classes with a total of 266 lines of code. The largest class, SupplementalInfoRetriever, has 121 lines of code and 8 methods. While the package is somewhat centralized in functionality (as indicated by class dependencies), the size and complexity are not excessive for typical software components. No single class dominates the package in terms of responsibilities or size to qualify as a God Component."
