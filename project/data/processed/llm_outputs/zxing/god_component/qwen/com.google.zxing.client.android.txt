    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 33 classes with a total of 2328 lines of code. While the package has a moderate number of classes and LOC, the distribution of responsibilities appears reasonably separated across multiple classes such as CaptureActivity, HttpHelper, DecodeThread, and others. No single class dominates the codebase excessively in terms of lines of code or complexity, and functionality seems distributed across specialized components."
