    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 396 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, ModulusPoly, has 192 LOC and WMC of 46, indicating moderate complexity. ErrorCorrection has 129 LOC and WMC of 23, also moderate. ModulusGF has 75 LOC and WMC of 18. The distribution of functionality across these three cohesive classes suggests a well-factored design rather than a God Component."
