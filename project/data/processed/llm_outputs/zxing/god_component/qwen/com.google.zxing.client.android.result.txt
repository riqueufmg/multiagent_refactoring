    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 14 classes with a total of 965 lines of code. While the ResultHandler class is relatively large (361 LOC, 43 methods), the overall distribution of functionality across multiple cohesive classes suggests a well-factored design rather than a single God Component. The package exhibits reasonable separation of concerns with specialized handlers for different result types."
