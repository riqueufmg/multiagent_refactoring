    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 11 classes with a total of 1750 lines of code. While the package has a moderate size, the responsibilities are distributed across multiple classes such as DecodedBitStreamParser (479 LOC), PDF417ScanningDecoder (455 LOC), and DetectionResult (238 LOC). No single class dominates the package in terms of functionality or complexity, and the design appears to follow a reasonable separation of concerns for a decoder module."
