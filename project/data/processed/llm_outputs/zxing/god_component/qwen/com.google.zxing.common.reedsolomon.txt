    "justification": "The package contains only 5 classes with a total of 530 lines of code. The largest class, GenericGFPoly, has 220 lines of code and a WMC of 49, which is not excessively large given its purpose. The distribution of responsibilities appears appropriate for a Reed-Solomon error correction module, with no single class dominating the functionality or size excessively."
