    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 8 classes with a total of 1102 lines of code. While the DecodedBitStreamParser class has 432 LOC and BitMatrixParser has 372 LOC, which are substantial, they are balanced by smaller, well-defined classes such as Mode, ECBlocks, and ECB. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable for a decoder module, with no single class dominating the complexity or functionality excessively."
