    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with a total of 750 lines of code. The largest class, Encoder, has 320 lines of code and a WMC of 65, which is high but not excessively so given its role as the main encoding logic handler. Other classes are relatively small and focused. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable for an encoder module within a barcode library, without evidence of excessive centralization or bloat that would characterize a God Component."
