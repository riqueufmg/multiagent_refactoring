    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with a total of 881 lines of code. While the CameraConfigurationUtils class is relatively large (344 LOC, WMC 71), the distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable for a camera management module in an Android application. No single class dominates the package excessively in terms of size or complexity, and the classes seem to follow a cohesive design related to camera configuration and management."
