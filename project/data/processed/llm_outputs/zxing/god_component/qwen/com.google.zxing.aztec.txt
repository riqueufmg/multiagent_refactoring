    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 161 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The class sizes are also moderate, with the largest class (AztecReader) having 75 lines of code. There is no indication of excessive complexity or centralization of functionality that would suggest a God Component."
