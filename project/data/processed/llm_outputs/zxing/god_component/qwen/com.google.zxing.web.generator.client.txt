    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 16 classes with a total of 1224 lines of code. While some individual classes like ContactInfoGenerator (221 LOC) and CalendarEventGenerator (235 LOC) are sizable, the overall distribution of responsibilities appears reasonably modular. There is no single class dominating the codebase in terms of lines of code or complexity that would indicate a God Component. The classes also exhibit some level of specialization and encapsulation, with dependencies between them suggesting a structured design rather than one monolithic component."
