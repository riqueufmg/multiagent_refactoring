    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes with a total of 237 lines of code. The largest class, WifiConfigManager, has 224 lines of code and 14 methods, which is not excessively large in the context of an Android component handling WiFi configuration logic. The package and its classes exhibit reasonable size and complexity for their functionality."
