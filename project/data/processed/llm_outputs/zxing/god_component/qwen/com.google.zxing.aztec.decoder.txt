    "justification": "The Decoder class contains 319 LOC out of the package's total of 330 LOC, indicating a dominant component. It has high complexity with WMC of 61, 10 fields, and 11 methods. The class manages multiple responsibilities including decoding logic, error correction, and data handling, supported by its numerous dependencies such as ReedSolomonDecoder, BitMatrix, and DecoderResult. The package contains only 3 classes, with one class (Decoder) overwhelmingly encapsulating most functionality and LOC."
