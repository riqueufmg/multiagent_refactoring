    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.maxicode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class (MaxiCodeReader) with 56 lines of code, which is not excessively large in terms of LOC or number of classes. The class has moderate complexity (WMC=9, NOM=4) and the package has limited dependencies (Ce=3, Ca=0), indicating it is a small, focused component rather than a God Component."
