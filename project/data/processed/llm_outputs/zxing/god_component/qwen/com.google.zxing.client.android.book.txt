    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.book",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes with a total of 422 lines of code. The largest class, SearchBookContentsActivity, has 190 lines of code and 7 methods, which is not excessively large in the context of an Android activity handling network tasks and UI logic. The presence of a NetworkTask inner class with 94 lines of code suggests some separation of concerns. The overall distribution of responsibilities across multiple classes and the absence of a single class dominating the package's complexity indicate that this is not a God Component."
