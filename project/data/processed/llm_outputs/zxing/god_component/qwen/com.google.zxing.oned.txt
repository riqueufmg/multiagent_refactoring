    "justification": "The package contains 32 classes with a total of 3631 lines of code. While the package has a substantial number of classes and LOC, the classes appear to be functionally cohesive, focusing on 1D barcode reading and writing operations. The largest classes (e.g., Code128Writer with 405 LOC and Code128Reader with 326 LOC) are complex but remain within reasonable bounds for their functionality. There is no evidence of excessive centralization of logic or responsibilities in a single component; instead, the package demonstrates a well-organized structure for handling various 1D barcode formats."
