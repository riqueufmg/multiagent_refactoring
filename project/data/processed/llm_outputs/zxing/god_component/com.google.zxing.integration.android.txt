    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes but is heavily dominated by a single oversized class. IntentIntegrator accounts for 325 of 380 LOC (~85% of the package), has 34 methods (nom), 24 fields (nof), high complexity (WMC=61) and many public methods (nopm=27), while the other class (IntentResult) is small (55 LOC). The concentration of code, methods and complexity in one class indicates the component is excessively large and centralizes too much responsibility, consistent with a God Component smell."
