    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.qrcode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes (num_classes=2) with a total of 204 LOC, split into QRCodeReader (loc=137, wmc=28) and QRCodeWriter (loc=67, wmc=13). The component is small in number of classes and modest in total size; dependencies (Ce=4, Ca=4) and lack of unusually high fan-in/fan-out do not indicate an excessively large or monolithic component. Therefore it does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
