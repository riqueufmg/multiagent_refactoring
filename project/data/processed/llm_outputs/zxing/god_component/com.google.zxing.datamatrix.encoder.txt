    "justification": "The package contains 19 classes and a total of 2409 LOC, which is large for a single component and indicates concentrated size. Several classes are individually very large and complex (MinimalEncoder: 614 LOC, wmc 41; HighLevelEncoder: 371 LOC, wmc 73; MinimalEncoder.Edge: 338 LOC; C40Encoder: 170 LOC, wmc 36; DefaultPlacement: 153 LOC, wmc 26; SymbolInfo: 123 LOC, wmc 38; ErrorCorrection: 109 LOC; EdifactEncoder: 109 LOC). The package aggregates many distinct responsibilities (multiple encoder strategies, placement logic, symbol info, error correction) rather than a single cohesive responsibility. The combination of high total LOC, many large/complex classes, and multiple responsibilities supports detecting a God Component smell for this package."
