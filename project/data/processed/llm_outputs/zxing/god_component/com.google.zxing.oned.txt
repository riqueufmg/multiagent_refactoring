    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 32 classes and 3,631 LOC (average ~113 LOC/class), indicating substantial size and many responsibilities. Several classes are individually large and complex (examples: Code128Writer 405 LOC, WMC 65; Code128Reader 326 LOC, WMC 79; UPCEANReader 279 LOC, WMC 40; Code39Reader 254 LOC, WMC 52; Code93Reader 221 LOC, WMC 47; OneDReader 196 LOC). There are also multiple inner types in the same package (e.g. Code128Writer inner classes and encoder), and the package mixes many concerns (multiple reader/writer formats, extension/support classes, manufacturer lookup, etc.). These factors (high total LOC, many classes, several highly complex classes and mixed responsibilities) justify detecting a God Component smell for com.google.zxing.oned."
