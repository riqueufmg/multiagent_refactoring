    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package concentrates a large amount of code and responsibilities: 12 classes totaling 1,108 LOC with multiple very large/complex classes (DecodedBitStreamParser: 261 LOC, WMC 61; BitMatrixParser: 175 LOC, WMC 35; Version: 163 LOC, WMC 23; Decoder: 114 LOC). Several classes show high cyclomatic complexity and many methods, indicating multiple responsibilities packed into single types. The package also has non-trivial afferent/efferent coupling (Ce=7, Ca=7), suggesting it is a central, highly connected component. Together these facts indicate an excessive concentration of code and responsibilities consistent with the God Component smell."
