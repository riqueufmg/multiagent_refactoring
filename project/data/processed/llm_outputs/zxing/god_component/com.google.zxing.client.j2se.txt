    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package aggregates 12 classes but a relatively large total size (1030 LOC) with several individually large/complex classes (DecodeWorker: 186 LOC, WMC 31; HtmlAssetTranslator: 151 LOC, WMC 26; CommandLineRunner: 118 LOC, WMC 26; MatrixToImageWriter: 111 LOC; BufferedImageLuminanceSource: 107 LOC). The package mixes multiple responsibilities (GUIRunner, command-line runner, encoding, decoding, image conversion, resource translation, web/chart integration) rather than a focused concern. Several classes show high cyclomatic complexity and many methods, indicating concentrated functionality and complexity. The package also depends on multiple other subsystems (com.google.zxing.multi, com.google.zxing.web, com.google.zxing.common, client.result), suggesting a central role. Taken together, these characteristics indicate the package is excessively large and does too many things, consistent with a God Component smell."
