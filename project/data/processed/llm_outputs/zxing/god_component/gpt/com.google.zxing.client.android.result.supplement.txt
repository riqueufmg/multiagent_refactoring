    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 5 classes and 266 LOC, which is not excessively large for a single component. Although one class (SupplementalInfoRetriever) is relatively large (121 LOC, WMC 25, NOM 8) and accounts for ~45% of the package LOC—indicating a localized risk of a God Class—the overall package size and class count do not justify labeling the entire package as a God Component. Class-level metrics suggest refactoring attention on SupplementalInfoRetriever, but the package as a whole is not excessively large in LOC or number of classes."
