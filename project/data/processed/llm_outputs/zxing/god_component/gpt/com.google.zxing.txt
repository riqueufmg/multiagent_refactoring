    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 24 classes and 1,265 LOC, which is moderate rather than excessively large. Class-level LOC values are distributed (several around ~80–130 LOC, many much smaller) with no single class dominating the package size. Coupling metrics (Ce=37, Ca=37) and the variety of small/medium classes (e.g., MultiFormatReader 126 LOC, LuminanceSource 105 LOC, BinaryBitmap 95 LOC, Result 99 LOC) indicate responsibilities are spread across multiple focused classes rather than concentrated in one monolithic component. Based on this contextual evidence, the package does not exhibit the extreme size/centralization characteristic of a God Component."
