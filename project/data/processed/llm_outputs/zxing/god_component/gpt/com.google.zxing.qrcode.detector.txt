    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 1,072 LOC concentrated in 7 classes, but the distribution is highly skewed: FinderPatternFinder alone is 536 LOC (~50% of the package), with 22 methods and very high complexity (WMC=107). Detector (238 LOC, WMC=37) and AlignmentPatternFinder (195 LOC, WMC=33) are also large and complex. A few classes hold most of the code and complexity rather than responsibilities being evenly distributed, indicating an excessive size/complexity concentrated in a small number of classes. These factors (high LOC concentration, large method counts, and high WMC in the key classes) support identifying this package as exhibiting the God Component smell."
