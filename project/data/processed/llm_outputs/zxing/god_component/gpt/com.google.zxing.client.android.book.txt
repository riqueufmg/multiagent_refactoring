    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.book",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes and 422 LOC total — not an excessive number of classes or overwhelmingly large size. The largest class, SearchBookContentsActivity, is 190 LOC and an inner NetworkTask is 94 LOC; other classes are small (27–48 LOC). Complexity metrics (WMC values mostly in single digits) and low coupling (Ce=1, Ca=1) indicate responsibilities are distributed and the package is not dominated by a single, excessively large component. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to label this package as a God Component."
