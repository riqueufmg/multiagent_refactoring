    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package concentrates a large amount of code and multiple responsibilities: total LOC = 714 across 11 classes with heavy concentration in a few classes (QRCodeEncoder: 266 LOC, WMC 57, nom 15; EncodeActivity: 159 LOC, WMC 21; VCardContactEncoder: 81 LOC, WMC 27). It contains encoder logic, contact/vCard/MECARD formatters and an activity, plus nested formatter classes, indicating multiple responsibilities rather than a single cohesive role. High complexity (WMCs), large class sizes and mixed responsibilities support the judgement that this package is excessively large and functions as a God Component."
