    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (num_classes = 1) with only 31 LOC, low complexity (wmc = 6), and limited dependencies (Ce = 2, Ca = 2, fanin = 0, fanout = 0). There is no evidence of an excessive number of classes or large size that would indicate a God Component; responsibilities appear limited to a small clipboard interface."
