    "justification": "The package is dominated by a single class: Detector.java contains 402 LOC out of the package's 436 LOC (~92%), indicating functionality concentrated in one component. Detector also has high internal complexity (WMC = 48), many methods (nom = 20) and fields (nof = 11), and multiple external dependencies, while the package contains only 3 classes overall. These facts (large LOC concentrated in one class, high complexity and many members) support detection of a God Component."
