    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package's LOC is 726 but one class, RSSExpandedReader, contains 607 LOC (~83.6% of the package) and very high complexity (WMC=123) and many methods (nom=21), while the remaining three classes are small (36, 45, 38 LOC). This concentration of size and complexity in a single class indicates the component is excessively large and likely embodies a God Component."
