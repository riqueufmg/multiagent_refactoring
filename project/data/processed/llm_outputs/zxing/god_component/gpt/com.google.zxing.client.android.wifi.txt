    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 237 LOC, but one class (WifiConfigManager) accounts for 224 LOC (~94% of the package), with 14 methods and a high WMC of 47. This single class disproportionately dominates the package in size and complexity, matching the God Component smell (excessively large component)."
