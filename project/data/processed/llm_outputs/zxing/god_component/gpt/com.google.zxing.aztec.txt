    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.aztec",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 161 LOC in total, with the largest class being 75 LOC (AztecReader) and the others 54 and 32 LOC. Method and complexity metrics are moderate (WMC 11–13) and there is no single class that dominates the package by size or complexity. Fan-in/fan-out at the class level are zero in the provided data, and dependencies are distributed to related subpackages rather than indicating a centralized, excessively large component. Based on these contextual metrics, the package is not excessively large and does not exhibit the God Component smell."
