    "justification": "The package is substantially large and central: 33 classes and 2,328 LOC. Several very large/high-complexity classes concentrate responsibilities in the package (notably CaptureActivity: 529 LOC, 29 methods, WMC 112; Intents: 193 LOC; DecodeHintManager: 162 LOC, WMC 32; HttpHelper: 161 LOC, WMC 27; LocaleManager: 134 LOC; ViewfinderView: 121 LOC, WMC 15). The package also depends on many subsystems (camera, history, share, encode, result.supplement, clipboard) indicating multiple responsibilities. These factors (high total LOC, many classes and multiple very large/complex classes plus wide dependency footprint) support the detection of a God Component."
