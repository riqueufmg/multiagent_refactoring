    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 6 classes with a total of 290 lines of code. While the JavaParserJsonDeserializer (126 LOC) and JavaParserJsonSerializer (129 LOC) classes are relatively large, they are not excessively so given their responsibilities in handling serialization logic. The inner classes within JavaParserJsonSerializer are small and auxiliary. The overall structure does not indicate an excessive concentration of functionality or size that would classify it as a God Component."
