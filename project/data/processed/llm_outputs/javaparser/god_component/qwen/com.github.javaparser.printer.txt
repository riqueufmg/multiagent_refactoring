    "justification": "The package contains 13 classes with a total of 3974 lines of code. Two classes, PrettyPrintVisitor (1588 loc, 122 methods) and DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor (1688 loc, 124 methods), are excessively large in terms of lines of code and number of methods, indicating a concentration of functionality that suggests a God Component smell."
