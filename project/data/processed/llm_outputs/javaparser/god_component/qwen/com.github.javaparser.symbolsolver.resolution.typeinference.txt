    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 21 classes with a total of 2021 lines of code. While the package has a considerable number of classes and LOC, the classes appear to be tightly focused on type inference functionality within the JavaParser project. The responsibilities are well-distributed among specialized classes (e.g., BoundSet, TypeInference, ConstraintFormulaSet, InferenceVariable), each handling distinct aspects of type inference. There is no single class that dominates the codebase in terms of size or complexity, and the overall structure suggests a cohesive subsystem rather than a God Component."
