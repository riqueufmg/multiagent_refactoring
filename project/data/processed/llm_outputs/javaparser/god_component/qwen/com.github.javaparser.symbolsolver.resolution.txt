    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class (SymbolSolver) with 106 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The class has 14 methods with a WMC of 26, indicating moderate complexity. Although it has high efferent coupling (20) and depends on many external classes, the size and number of classes do not meet the criteria for a God Component."
