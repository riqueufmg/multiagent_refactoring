    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 31 classes with a total of 1358 lines of code. While the number of classes is relatively high, the individual classes are small and focused, with low complexity (WMC <= 22 for the most complex class), suggesting a well-distributed design rather than a single God Component. The package acts as a module for node type interfaces, which is a reasonable design choice for this context."
