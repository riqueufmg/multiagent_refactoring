    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 258 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, ReferenceTypeImpl, has 161 lines of code and 45 weighted method count, which while significant, does not indicate a god component pattern. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable across the classes, with no single class dominating the functionality or size excessively."
