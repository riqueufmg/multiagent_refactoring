    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.chunks",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with a total of 359 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, ModifierValidator, has 168 lines of code and 18 methods, but this is still within reasonable limits for a specialized validator class. The other classes are relatively small and focused, indicating a well-distributed design rather than a single God Component."
