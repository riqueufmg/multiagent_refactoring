    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 26 classes with a total of 2723 lines of code, indicating a high level of complexity and size. The Statement class alone has 92 methods and 264 lines of code, showing centralization of functionality. High fan-out coupling (Ce=9) and extensive dependencies among numerous statement-related classes suggest excessive responsibility and lack of modularity."
