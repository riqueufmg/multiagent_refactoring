    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 18 classes with a total of 588 lines of code, which is not excessively large for a cohesive package. The classes appear to be well-organized around concrete syntax model printing functionality, with each class having a specific responsibility (e.g., CsmTextBlock, CsmChar, CsmList, etc.). The package has a reasonable number of dependencies (7 efferent, 3 afferent) and the individual class sizes are modest (most under 100 LOC), indicating good decomposition rather than a single God Component."
