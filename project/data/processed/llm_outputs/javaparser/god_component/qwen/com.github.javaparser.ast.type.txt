    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 16 classes with a total of 1563 lines of code, which is not excessively large for a package handling AST type representations. The classes are cohesive and focused on type-related functionality, with no single class dominating the codebase. The distribution of lines of code and responsibilities across multiple classes indicates a well-organized design rather than a God Component."
