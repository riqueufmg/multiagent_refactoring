    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 17 classes with a total of 134 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The classes are small and focused, with most having 5 lines of code and no methods or fields, indicating they are likely simple configuration or version-specific processors. The overall structure suggests a well-organized set of post-processors rather than a single overly complex component."
