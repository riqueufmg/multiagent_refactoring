    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 101 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The classes themselves are also reasonably sized, with the largest class having 54 lines of code and 25 nested classes, which does not indicate an excessive concentration of functionality. The package has a balanced number of dependencies (6 efferent and 6 afferent couplings), suggesting it is not overly coupled or central to the system."
