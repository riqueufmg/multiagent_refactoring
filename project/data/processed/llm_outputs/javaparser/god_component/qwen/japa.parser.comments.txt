    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class with 7 lines of code, which is not excessively large in terms of LOC or number of classes. The single class ClassWithOrphanComments also has minimal complexity with only 1 method and 7 lines of code, indicating it is a small, focused component rather than a god component."
