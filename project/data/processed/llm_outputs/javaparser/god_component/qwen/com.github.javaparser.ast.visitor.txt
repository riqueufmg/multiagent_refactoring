    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 18 classes with a total of 11,816 lines of code. Several classes within the package are excessively large in terms of methods (e.g., VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, ModifierVisitor, and others have over 100 methods) and lines of code (e.g., GenericListVisitorAdapter and NodeFinderVisitor exceed 1,800 LOC). The high number of classes and the substantial size of individual classes indicate that the package is承担 excessive responsibilities, qualifying it as a God Component."
