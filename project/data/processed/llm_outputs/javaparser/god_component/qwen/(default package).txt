    "justification": "The package contains 101 classes with a total of 676 lines of code. While the number of classes is relatively high, the average lines of code per class is low (approximately 6.7 LOC/class), and most classes are small test or utility classes. There is no single class or component that dominates the codebase in terms of size or complexity. The distribution of code and responsibilities appears to be spread across many small, likely test-related, classes rather than concentrated in one large component."
