    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes with a total of 152 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, ResolvedTypeParametersMap, has 84 lines of code and 12 methods, which is manageable. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable, with no single class dominating the package in terms of complexity or size."
