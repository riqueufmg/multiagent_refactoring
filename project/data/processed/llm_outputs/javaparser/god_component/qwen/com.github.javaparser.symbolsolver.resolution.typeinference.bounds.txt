    "justification": "The package contains only 5 classes with a total of 210 lines of code, which is not excessively large. Each class has a manageable size (ranging from 21 to 60 LOC) and the overall complexity is distributed reasonably across the components. There is no indication that a single component is dominating the system or taking on responsibilities beyond its scope."
