    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 8 classes with a total of 1736 lines of code. While the package has a moderate size, none of the individual classes exhibit excessive complexity or size that would indicate a God Component. The largest class, DefaultVisitorAdapter, has 311 lines of code and 103 methods, which is substantial but not excessively large given its role as a visitor adapter handling numerous AST node types. Other classes in the package are significantly smaller and have well-defined responsibilities. The distribution of functionality across multiple cohesive classes suggests a reasonable design rather than a God Component."
