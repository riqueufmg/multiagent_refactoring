    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes with a total of 170 lines of code. The largest class has 41 lines of code and 9 methods, which is not excessively large. The package does not exhibit characteristics of a God Component as the classes appear to be focused and cohesive, implementing different types of changes (NoChange, PropertyChange, ListAdditionChange, etc.) within a specific domain (lexical preservation changes)."
