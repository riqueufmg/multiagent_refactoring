    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class (Widget) with 20 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The class itself has low complexity (WMC=3, NOM=3) and the package has a reasonable number of dependencies (Ce=5). There is no indication of excessive size or complexity that would characterize a God Component."
