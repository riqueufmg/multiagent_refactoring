    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 24 classes with a total of 2568 lines of code. While the number of classes is relatively high, the lines of code are distributed across multiple cohesive classes dealing with JavaParser declarations. There is no single class or component that excessively dominates the codebase in terms of size or responsibility. The distribution of LOC and responsibilities among specialized classes (e.g., JavaParserFieldDeclaration, JavaParserMethodDeclaration, etc.) indicates modular design rather than a God Component."
