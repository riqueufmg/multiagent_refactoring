    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with a total of 1322 lines of code. While the MethodResolutionLogic class is notably large (803 LOC, 31 methods), the overall package distribution appears reasonable for a logic-focused module handling method and constructor resolution complexities. No single class dominates the package excessively in terms of class count or lines of code disproportionately."
