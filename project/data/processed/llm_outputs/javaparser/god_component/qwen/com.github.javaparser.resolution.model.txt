    "package": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.model",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 143 lines of code, which is not excessively large. None of the individual classes exhibit an unusually high number of methods, fields, or lines of code that would indicate they are taking on too many responsibilities. The complexity metrics (WMC, LCOM) for each class are within reasonable ranges, and there is no indication of excessive coupling or centralization of functionality that would characterize a God Component."
