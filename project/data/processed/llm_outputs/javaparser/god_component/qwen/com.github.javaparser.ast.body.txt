    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 18 classes with a total of 3034 lines of code. While the package has a substantial size, the classes are well-distributed in terms of responsibilities, with no single class excessively dominating the codebase. The largest class, CallableDeclaration, has 293 lines of code and 71 methods, which is significant but not excessively large in the context of this domain. The package's structure reflects a cohesive set of related AST node types for Java body declarations, indicating appropriate encapsulation rather than a God Component."
