    "package": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.quality",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class (NotNullGenerator) with 93 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The class has 8 methods and a WMC of 18, indicating moderate complexity. The package has 7 efferent couplings, which is reasonable for a specialized generator component. There is no evidence of excessive size or responsibility that would indicate a God Component."
