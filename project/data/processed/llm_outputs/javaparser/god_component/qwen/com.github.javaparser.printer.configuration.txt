    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes with a total of 452 lines of code. The largest class, PrettyPrinterConfiguration, has 170 lines of code and 34 methods, which is significant but not excessively large in the context of its functionality. Other classes are relatively small and focused. The package does not exhibit excessive size in terms of lines of code or number of classes that would indicate a God Component smell."
