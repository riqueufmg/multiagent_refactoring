    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes with a total of 82 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The classes are focused on specific declarator types (e.g., ParameterSymbolDeclarator, FieldSymbolDeclarator) and share common dependencies related to symbol solving. The size and complexity are reasonable for the functionality provided."
