    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 22 classes with a total of 1189 lines of code. While the package has a high number of classes and LOC, the classes appear to be well-organized and focused on specific aspects of declarations (e.g., ResolvedMethodDeclaration, ResolvedTypeDeclaration, ResolvedEnumDeclaration). The responsibilities are distributed across multiple cohesive classes rather than concentrated in a single large component. No single class dominates the package in terms of size or complexity that would indicate a God Component."
