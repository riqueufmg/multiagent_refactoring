    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 16 classes with a total of 1848 lines of code. While the package has a moderate number of classes and LOC, the complexity is distributed across multiple cohesive components dealing with reflection-based symbol resolution. No single class dominates the package in terms of size or responsibility, and the classes appear to have well-defined roles related to reflection modeling. The package does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would indicate a God Component."
