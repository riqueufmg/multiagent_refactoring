    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with a total of 835 lines of code. While the package has a moderate size, none of the individual classes are excessively large in terms of lines of code (ranging from 91 to 144 LOC) or number of methods (ranging from 19 to 44). The complexity metrics (WMC, LCOM) also do not indicate any single class dominating the design. The package appears to be well-organized around the concept of module declarations and directives, without showing signs of excessive centralization or bloat that would characterize a God Component."
