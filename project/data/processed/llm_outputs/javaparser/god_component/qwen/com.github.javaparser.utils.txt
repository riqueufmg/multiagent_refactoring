    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.utils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 34 classes with a total of 2501 lines of code, indicating excessive size. Key classes like SourceRoot (453 LOC, 40 methods), StringEscapeUtils (257 LOC, 10 fields), and Utils (230 LOC, 26 methods) are significantly large. The package also exhibits high afferent coupling (Ca=35), suggesting it is heavily depended upon, which combined with its size and complexity, indicates it has too much responsibility and acts as a God Component."
