    "package": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 15 classes with a total of 426 lines of code, which is not excessively large for a generator package. Each class has a low LOC count (ranging from 12 to 56), low complexity (WMC mostly under 10), and consistent structure, indicating focused responsibilities. The classes appear to be generator implementations for different visitor patterns, which justifies the collective size and number of classes."
