    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with a total of 508 lines of code. The largest class, Comment, has 158 lines of code and 35 methods, which is not excessively large in the context of a specialized AST node. The classes appear to be well-scoped to handle different types of comments, and the package's responsibilities are cohesive around comment handling in Java source code. No single class dominates the package's complexity or size."
