    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class 'NameLogic' with 599 LOC and 22 methods, which dominates the package's total of 629 LOC. The class has a high WMC of 184, indicating high complexity. The other classes in the package are minimal in size and functionality, suggesting a lack of balanced distribution of responsibilities. This centralization of logic and size indicates the presence of a God Component."
