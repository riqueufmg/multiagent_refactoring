    "justification": "The package contains only 5 classes with a total of 325 lines of code. While AbstractGenerator is relatively large (165 LOC), the other classes are small to moderate in size. There is no single class that dominates the package excessively in terms of lines of code or number of classes. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonably balanced across multiple classes."
