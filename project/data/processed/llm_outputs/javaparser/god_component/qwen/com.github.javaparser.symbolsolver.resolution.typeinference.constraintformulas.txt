    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes with a total of 433 lines of code. While the class ExpressionCompatibleWithType is notably larger (165 LOC, WMC of 45), the overall package size and class count are not excessively large. The distribution of responsibilities appears reasonable for a specialized domain like type inference constraint formulas, and no single class dominates the package to an excessive degree."
