    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package 'japa.bdd.samples' contains a single dominant class 'JavaConcepts' with 299 LOC and 9 methods, alongside multiple small nested or inner classes. The total package LOC is 430 with 12 classes, indicating a concentration of functionality within one primary class and suggesting a lack of proper decomposition. The primary class 'JavaConcepts' also exhibits high complexity (WMC=23) and significant internal structure (LCOM=0.888), further supporting the presence of a God Component."
