    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.tensorflow.op",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package 'org.tensorflow.op' contains only 4 classes but has a very high LOC count of 12688. One of the classes, 'Ops', is particularly large with 3172 LOC, 313 methods, and 17 fields. The high number of methods and fields in a single class, combined with the overall package size, indicates a God Component smell."
