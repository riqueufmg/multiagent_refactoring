    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.ast' contains 21 classes with a total of 2829 lines of code, indicating a large and potentially overly complex component. Key classes such as 'Node' (877 LOC, 78 methods), 'NodeList' (460 LOC, 67 methods), and 'CompilationUnit' (615 LOC, 59 methods) are excessively large in terms of lines of code and number of methods, suggesting centralization of functionality and lack of proper decomposition. The high number of classes and significant size of core classes indicate that this package may be acting as a God Component by accumulating too much responsibility."
