    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class with 55 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The class MethodDeclarationCommonLogic has moderate complexity with WMC of 13 and 5 methods, indicating it is reasonably sized and focused. There is no evidence of excessive size in terms of LOC or number of classes to qualify as a God Component."
