    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 48 classes with a total of 4911 lines of code, indicating a high level of complexity and responsibility. The Expression class alone has 177 methods and 536 lines of code, showing it takes on excessive responsibilities. The high number of classes and LOC in a single package, combined with the presence of a dominant class, confirms the God Component smell."
