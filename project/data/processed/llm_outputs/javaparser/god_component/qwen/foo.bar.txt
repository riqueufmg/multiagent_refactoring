    "justification": "The package contains only 6 classes with a total of 20 lines of code, which is not excessively large. None of the individual classes exhibit a high number of fields, methods, or lines of code that would indicate they are taking on too many responsibilities. The dependencies between classes are minimal, and there is no indication of excessive complexity or centralization of functionality."
