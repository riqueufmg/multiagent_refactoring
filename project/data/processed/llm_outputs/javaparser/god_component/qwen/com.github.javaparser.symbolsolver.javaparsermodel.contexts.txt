    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 37 classes with a total of 2451 lines of code. While the package has a substantial number of classes and lines of code, the individual classes are generally small and focused, with most classes having low LOC and WMC values. The largest classes (e.g., StatementContext with 178 LOC and 47 WMC, MethodCallExprContext with 312 LOC and 86 WMC) are still within reasonable limits for their functionality. The package appears to be a well-organized collection of context-related classes for the JavaParser symbol solver, each handling specific AST node types, rather than one excessively large component."
