    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.generator.metamodel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 5 classes with a total of 369 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, MetaModelGenerator, has 185 lines of code and 8 methods, which is manageable. The other classes are significantly smaller, with lines of code ranging from 35 to 75. The package does not exhibit signs of being a God Component as the code is reasonably distributed across multiple classes without any single class dominating the functionality or size."
