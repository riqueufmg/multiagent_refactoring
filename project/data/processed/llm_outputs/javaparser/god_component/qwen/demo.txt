    "justification": "The package 'demo' contains only 6 classes and 111 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The classes within the package also have low complexity and size, with the largest class having 31 lines of code and a WMC of 4. There is no indication of excessive responsibility or centralization of functionality that would suggest a God Component."
