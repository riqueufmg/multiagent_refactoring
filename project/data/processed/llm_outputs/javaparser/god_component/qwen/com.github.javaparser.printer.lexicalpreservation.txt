    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 36 classes with a total of 3801 lines of code. While the LOC is substantial, it is distributed across many classes, with the largest class (Difference) at 788 LOC and 189 WMC. The complexity is spread out rather than concentrated in a single excessively large component. The package appears to be a cohesive module for lexical preservation in JavaParser, with classes having focused responsibilities."
