    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes with a total of 1135 lines of code. While the LOC is moderately high, it is distributed across multiple cohesive classes, each handling distinct responsibilities related to type solving. No single class dominates the codebase in terms of size or complexity, and the classes appear to follow a reasonable separation of concerns for a specialized module."
