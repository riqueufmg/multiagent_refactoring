    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes with a total of 360 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The classes appear to have focused responsibilities related to node generation, with no single class dominating the codebase. The distribution of lines of code and complexity is reasonably balanced across multiple specialized generators."
