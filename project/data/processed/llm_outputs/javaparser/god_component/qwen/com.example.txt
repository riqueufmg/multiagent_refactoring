    "package": "com.example",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 6 classes with a total of 34 lines of code, which is not excessively large. None of the individual classes exhibit a high number of fields, methods, or lines of code that would indicate a God Component. The complexity metrics (WMC, LCOM) are also low, indicating that the classes are simple and do not centralize functionality."
