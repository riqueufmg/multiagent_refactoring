    "justification": "The package 'main' contains 26 classes and 98 lines of code, which are not excessively large. The classes listed have very low complexity (WMC mostly 0 or 1), minimal lines of code per class (mostly under 10 LOC), and no significant structural indicators of a God Component. There is no single class or component that dominates the codebase in terms of size or responsibility."
