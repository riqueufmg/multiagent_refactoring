    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 12 classes with a total of 1040 lines of code. While the package has a moderate size, the classes are reasonably distributed in terms of responsibilities, with no single class excessively dominating the codebase. The largest class, ResolvedReferenceType, has 377 lines of code and 51 methods, which is substantial but not indicative of a God Component given the context of type resolution logic. The package's complexity is justified by its role in handling various type resolution scenarios."
