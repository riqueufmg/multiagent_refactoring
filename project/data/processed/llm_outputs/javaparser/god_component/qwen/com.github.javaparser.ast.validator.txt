    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes with a total of 190 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The classes are specialized and focused on validation-related functionality, with clear separation of concerns. No single class dominates the package in terms of size or responsibility, and the overall structure reflects a well-organized validation module rather than a God Component."
