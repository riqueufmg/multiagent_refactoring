    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 16 classes with a total of 1556 lines of code. While the package has a moderate number of classes and LOC, the classes themselves are reasonably sized and focused, with no single class dominating the codebase. The distribution of responsibilities appears balanced across multiple cohesive classes, each handling specific aspects of the javassist model. There is no indication of one component being excessively large or handling too many responsibilities."
