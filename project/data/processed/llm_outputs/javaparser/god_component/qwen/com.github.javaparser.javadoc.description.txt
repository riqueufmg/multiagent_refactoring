    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 5 classes with a total of 186 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, JavadocInlineTag, has 71 lines of code and 9 methods, which is still within reasonable limits. The package does not exhibit signs of excessive complexity or centralization of functionality that would indicate a God Component."
