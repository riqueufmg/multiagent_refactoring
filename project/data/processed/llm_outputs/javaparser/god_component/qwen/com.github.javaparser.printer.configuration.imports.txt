    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 99 lines of code, which is not excessively large. Each class has a manageable size (16-49 LOC) and low complexity (WMC 4-10). The package has minimal dependencies (Ce=1, Ca=1) and the classes within it are focused on specific import ordering strategies, indicating good separation of concerns rather than a single overly complex component."
