    "justification": "The package contains only 5 classes with a total of 57 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, GenericClass, has 31 lines of code and 8 methods, which is still within reasonable limits. There are no indicators of excessive complexity or responsibility concentration that would suggest a God Component."
