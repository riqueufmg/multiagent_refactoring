    "justification": "The package contains 16 classes and 1848 LOC, which is moderate and not excessively large for a cohesive set of reflection model declarations. Individual class sizes are reasonable, with the largest having 312 LOC, and the total package size does not indicate an unmanageable or overly complex component."
