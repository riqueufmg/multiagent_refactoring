    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package has 21 classes and 2829 lines of code, which is substantial but not excessively large for a core AST package in a parser library. The package has a single responsibility (defining AST nodes) and the size is distributed across multiple classes, though two classes are particularly large. The high afferent coupling (Ca=44) is expected for a core package and does not necessarily indicate a God Component."
