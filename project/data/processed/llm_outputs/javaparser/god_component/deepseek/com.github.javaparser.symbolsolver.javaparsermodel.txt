    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 8 classes and 1736 lines of code, which is a moderate size for a complex library component. While some individual classes are large (e.g., DefaultVisitorAdapter with 103 methods, JavaParserFacade with 494 LOC), the overall package is not excessively large in terms of class count or total LOC within the context of a symbol-solving library."
