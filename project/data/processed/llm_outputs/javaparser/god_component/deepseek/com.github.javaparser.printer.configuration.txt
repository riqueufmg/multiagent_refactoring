    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes and 452 lines of code, which are moderate in size. The largest class, PrettyPrinterConfiguration, has 170 LOC and 34 methods, but this does not constitute excessive size for the entire package. The package's coupling (Ce=2, Ca=5) and the overall code volume are within reasonable limits, not indicating a God Component."
