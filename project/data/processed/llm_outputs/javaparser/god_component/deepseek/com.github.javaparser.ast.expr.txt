    "justification": "The package contains 48 classes and 4911 LOC, which is excessively large. This is compounded by the presence of a very large base class (Expression with 536 LOC, 177 methods, and 71 children) and multiple other substantial classes, indicating the package is trying to do too much and should be split."
