    "justification": "Package contains 24 classes (moderate count for a domain-specific declaration module) and 2568 LOC, with individual classes showing reasonable size distribution (most under 150 LOC, few larger but specialized). No single component exhibits excessive size or overwhelming complexity given the package's focused responsibility for Java declaration representations."
