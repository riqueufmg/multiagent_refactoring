    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 16 classes and 1556 lines of code, which is moderately sized for a Java library package. The classes are specialized implementations for different declaration types (enum, interface, record, etc.) and are focused on a single responsibility domain (Javassist model integration). No single class exceeds 200 LOC, and the total codebase is within reasonable limits for its functionality."
