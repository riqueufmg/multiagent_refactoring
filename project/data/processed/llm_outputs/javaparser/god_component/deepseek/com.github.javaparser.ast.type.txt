    "justification": "Package has 16 classes with total 1563 LOC, which is moderate for a domain modeling component. Individual classes exhibit focused responsibilities (e.g., ArrayType, ClassOrInterfaceType) with reasonable sizes (max 211 LOC) and low fan-out. The high number of classes is justified by representing distinct type system entities in a parser framework."
