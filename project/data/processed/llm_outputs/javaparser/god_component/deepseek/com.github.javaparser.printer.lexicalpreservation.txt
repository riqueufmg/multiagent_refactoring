Multiple individual classes also exhibit high complexity metrics (Difference: 788 LOC, 46 methods; LexicalPreservingPrinter: 592 LOC). The package handles lexical preservation functionality with numerous responsibilities spread across many tightly coupled classes, indicating excessive size and reduced cohesion."
