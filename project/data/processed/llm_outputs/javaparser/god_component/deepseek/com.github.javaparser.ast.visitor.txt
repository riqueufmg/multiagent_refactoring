    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Package contains 18 classes and 11816 LOC, which is excessively large for a single component. Multiple visitor classes exceed 1000 LOC each and have over 100 methods, indicating massive responsibilities and lack of separation. The package has high coupling (Ce=11, Ca=11) and handles extensive AST node types across the entire codebase."
