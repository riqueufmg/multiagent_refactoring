    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes and 753 LOC overall, which is moderate in size for a package. Although complexity is concentrated in three relatively large classes (Context: 214 LOC, Navigator: 197 LOC, MethodUsage: 175 LOC with high WMC and many methods), the remaining seven classes are small (many < 62 LOC) so the package is not excessively large as a whole. The class count (10) is not unusually high and overall LOC is not dominated across many classes, indicating the size/complexity problem is localized to a few classes rather than the component itself being a God Component. Metrics such as Ca=31 and Ce=9 show the package is moderately connected but do not by themselves indicate excessive component size."
