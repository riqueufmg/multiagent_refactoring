    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.included_jar",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 6 LOC (each class ~3 LOC). Class-level metrics show minimal complexity (wmc 0), no methods of interest (nom 0), and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin 0, fanout 0). Given the very small size and low complexity, it is not an excessively large component and therefore does not qualify as a God Component."
