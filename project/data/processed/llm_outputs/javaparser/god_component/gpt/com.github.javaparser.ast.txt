    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 21 classes and 2,829 LOC with several very large, highly complex classes concentrated in it. Notably: Node (877 LOC, WMC 150, NOM 78, NC 49), CompilationUnit (615 LOC, WMC 100, NOM 59), and NodeList (460 LOC, WMC 91, NOM 67). These few classes account for a large portion of the package LOC and exhibit high complexity and many responsibilities. Additionally the package has high afferent coupling (Ca = 60), indicating many other components depend on it, increasing the impact of its size/complexity. Taken together, the concentration of large, complex classes and the package-level size and centrality justify identifying this package as a God Component."
