    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class and only 2 lines of code (num_classes=1, loc=2). Class-level metrics show zero complexity and interactions (wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no package dependencies. Given the very small size and lack of internal/external coupling, the component is not excessively large and therefore does not exhibit the God Component smell."
