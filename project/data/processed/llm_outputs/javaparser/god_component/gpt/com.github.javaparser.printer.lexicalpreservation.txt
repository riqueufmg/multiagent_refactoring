    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is a集中 of substantial size and complexity: 36 classes and 3801 LOC. Several very large, complex classes live in the same package (Difference: loc=788, nom=46, wmc=189; LexicalPreservingPrinter: loc=592, nom=14, wmc=63; LexicalDifferenceCalculator: loc=328, nom=17, wmc=71; DifferenceElementCalculator: loc=253, nom=11, wmc=52). This indicates many responsibilities concentrated in one component rather than distributed. The package also contains many mid-sized utility/inner classes supporting heavy core logic, and shows moderate coupling (Ce=16, Ca=6), consistent with a central, heavyweight component. Together these facts support detecting a God Component: the package is excessively large in LOC and number of classes and houses multiple high-complexity classes that suggest excessive responsibility concentration."
