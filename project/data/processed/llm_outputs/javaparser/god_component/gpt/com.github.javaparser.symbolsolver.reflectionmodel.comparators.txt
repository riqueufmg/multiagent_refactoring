    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package is small and not excessively large: num_classes = 3 and total LOC = 49. Individual classes are small (LOCs 12, 18, 19) with low complexity (WMC 3, 6, 6). Coupling is minimal (Ce = 0, Ca = 1, class-level fanin/fanout = 0) and there is no evidence of an outsized number of classes or overwhelmingly large source size. These metrics do not support identifying this package as a God Component."
