    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 31 classes and 1358 LOC, which indicates substantial size and potential concentration of responsibilities. Several individual classes are large and complex (e.g., NodeWithMembers: 309 LOC, nom 37; NodeWithAnnotations: 147 LOC, nom 20; NodeWithVariables: 99 LOC, wmc 22; NodeWithParameters: 91 LOC, nom 18; NodeWithStatements: 65 LOC, wmc 17), showing that significant functionality is implemented within this single package. The package also depends on and is depended on by many other packages (multiple AST subpackages), suggesting it plays a central role. Based on this combination of high class count, high total LOC, and multiple oversized classes concentrating behavior, this component is judged to exhibit the God Component smell."
