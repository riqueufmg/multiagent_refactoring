    "justification": "The package contains 26 classes and 2,723 LOC, a high concentration of code for a single package. Several classes are large and complex: Statement (loc 264, nom 92, wmc 92) and other heavy classes such as SwitchEntry (loc 193, wmc 46), ExplicitConstructorInvocationStmt (loc 184, wmc 47), TryStmt (loc 168, wmc 46), ForStmt (loc 167, wmc 45) and IfStmt (loc 154, wmc 38). The package average LOC (~105 per class) plus multiple classes with very high method counts/complexity indicates functionality and responsibility are centralized and the component is excessively large, supporting detection of the God Component smell."
