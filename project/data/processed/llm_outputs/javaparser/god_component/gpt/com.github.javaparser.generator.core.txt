{
    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (num_classes=1) with only 48 LOC, low complexity (WMC=3), few methods (nom=2, nopm=1), and minimal coupling (Ca=0, Ce=2, fanin=0, fanout=0). These indicators show the component is small and not excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of classes, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
