    "justification": "The package '(default package)' aggregates 101 classes (num_classes = 101) with a total of 676 LOC. Even though many classes are small, the very high number of classes concentrated in a single package (including many inner/test classes listed) indicates the component is excessively large by class count and therefore exhibits the God Component smell."
