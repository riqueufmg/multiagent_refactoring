    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 35 classes and 658 LOC in total, but the code is spread across many small, focused validator classes (average ~19 LOC/class). Only a few classes are larger (e.g. Java1_0Validator at 125 LOC, Java22Validator 61 LOC, Java5Validator 46 LOC), and there is no single overwhelmingly large class or overwhelmingly large total LOC for a single cohesive responsibility. Coupling is low (Ce=3, Ca=1) and class-level fan-in/fan-out metrics are minimal, indicating cohesive, low-coupled responsibilities (per-version validators). Given the modest total LOC, distributed small classes, and low coupling, this package does not exhibit the God Component smell."
