    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package 'implements_duplicate' contains only 3 classes and a total of 8 LOC (class LOCs: 4, 2, 2). There are no outgoing or incoming dependencies and no complex metrics indicating high responsibility or size. Given the very small number of classes and minimal lines of code, the component is not excessively large and does not qualify as a God Component."
