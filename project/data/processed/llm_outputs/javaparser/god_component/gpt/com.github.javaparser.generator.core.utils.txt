    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.utils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class and 16 LOC (package metrics: num_classes=1, loc=16). The single class CodeUtils also has low size and complexity (loc=16, wmc=3, nom=2) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, Ce=2, Ca=1). Given the very small LOC and single-class composition, there is no evidence of an excessively large component, so the God Component smell is not present."
