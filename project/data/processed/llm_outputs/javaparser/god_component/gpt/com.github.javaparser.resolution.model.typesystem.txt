    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and a total of 258 LOC, which is not excessively large for a component. Class-level metrics show ReferenceTypeImpl is the largest (161 LOC, 17 methods, WMC 45) and somewhat complex, but the other classes are small (LazyType 70 LOC, NullType 27 LOC). The small number of classes and modest total LOC indicate the component as a whole is not a 'God Component', even though one class has relatively high complexity."
