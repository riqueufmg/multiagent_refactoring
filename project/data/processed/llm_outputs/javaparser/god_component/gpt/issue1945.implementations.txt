    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "issue1945.implementations",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package is small and not excessively large: num_classes=3 and total loc=17. Individual classes are tiny (Sheep loc=5, WoolRenderer loc=7, HairTypeWool loc=5) with low method counts (nom 1,2,1) and low WMC values, no significant fan-in/fan-out or high coupling. There is no indication of a single component accumulating excessive responsibilities or lines of code, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
