    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package com.github.javaparser.storage contains only 1 class (PrimaryType) with 2 LOC, no methods (nof=0, nom=0), WMC=0, and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (Ca=0, Ce=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the component is extremely small and has no signs of being excessively large, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
