    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 121 classes and 2,549 LOC, indicating a very large component by both class count and total size. In particular, the class JavaParserMetaModel is extremely large (973 LOC) and aggregates a very large number of elements (many fields/entries indicated by nopf=118 and nof=119), while PropertyMetaModel (194 LOC) and BaseNodeMetaModel (168 LOC) are also substantial. The package therefore concentrates a large portion of the package-level LOC and responsibilities into a few very large classes and hosts an unusually high number of related meta-model classes, consistent with a God Component (excessive size and centralized responsibility)."
