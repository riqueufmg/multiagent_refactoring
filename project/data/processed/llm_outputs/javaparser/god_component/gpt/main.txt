{
    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "main",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the package contains 26 classes, the total LOC is only 98 (average ~3.8 LOC per class) and no individual class shows high size or complexity. Metrics show very small LOC per class (mostly 1–6), low WMC values, and zero fanin/fanout for classes. Given the small overall code size and lack of large or complex classes, the package is not excessively large and does not qualify as a God Component."
