    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 16 classes with a total of 1556 LOC (average ~97 LOC/class) and many very large, highly complex classes concentrated in the same package. Notable examples: JavassistRecordDeclaration (loc 197, nom 39, wmc 57), JavassistClassDeclaration (loc 182, nom 39, wmc 56), JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter (loc 188, wmc 34), JavassistUtils (loc 156, wmc 39), JavassistInterfaceDeclaration (loc 141, nom 28, wmc 42) and JavassistEnumDeclaration (loc 136, nom 28, wmc 40). Several classes have large numbers of methods and high cyclomatic complexity, indicating multiple responsibilities are bundled here. The package also has substantial efferent coupling (Ce=21), showing it depends on many other packages. Taken together — high total LOC, many classes with concentrated complexity and many methods — this indicates the package is excessively large and likely a God Component."
