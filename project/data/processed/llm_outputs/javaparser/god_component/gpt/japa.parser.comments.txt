    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single small class (ClassWithOrphanComments) with 7 LOC and lightweight metrics (nom=1, wmc=1, nof=0). The package-level LOC is 7 and num_classes is 1, indicating it is not excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of classes. Dependencies (Ce/Ca) are 0 and the class has no notable fan-in/fan-out, so there is no evidence of a God Component."
