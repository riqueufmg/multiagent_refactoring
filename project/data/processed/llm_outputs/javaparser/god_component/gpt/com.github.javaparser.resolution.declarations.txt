    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 22 classes and 1,189 LOC, which is substantial for a single component. Complexity and size are concentrated in multiple large classes: ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration (loc 230, nom 33, wmc 41), ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration (loc 230, nom 31, wmc 37), and ResolvedTypeDeclaration (loc 144, nom 25, wmc 26). Several other classes also have non‑trivial method counts (e.g., ResolvedMethodLikeDeclaration nom 15, ResolvedDeclaration nom 15). The package has high afferent coupling (Ca = 30), indicating many clients depend on it, and relatively low efferent coupling (Ce = 3), suggesting it centralizes responsibilities. The combination of many classes, concentrated large/complex classes, high method counts and strong incoming coupling supports classification as a God Component."
