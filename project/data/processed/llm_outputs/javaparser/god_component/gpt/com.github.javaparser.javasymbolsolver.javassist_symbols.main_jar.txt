    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.main_jar",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 17 classes but only 47 total LOC, an average of ~2.8 LOC per class, and every class shows very small size (most classes 1–4 LOC) and minimal complexity (wmc, nom near 0). Package-level metrics (num_classes=17, loc=47, Ca=0, Ce=0) and the absence of large or highly complex classes indicate the component is not excessively large in terms of lines of code or class complexity, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
