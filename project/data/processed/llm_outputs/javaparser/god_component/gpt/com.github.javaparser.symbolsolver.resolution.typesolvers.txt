    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package totals show 1,135 LOC across 9 classes, concentrating substantial size and complexity into several large classes. Notably: JavaParserTypeSolver (232 LOC, 20 methods, WMC 48), JarTypeSolver (247 LOC, 19 methods, WMC 39), CombinedTypeSolver (214 LOC, 15 methods, WMC 29) and TypeSolverBuilder (156 LOC, 14 methods, WMC 16). These classes carry many methods and high complexity metrics, indicating the component centralizes large responsibilities. Given the overall LOC and multiple large, complex classes within a single package, the component is contextually excessively large and matches the God Component smell."
