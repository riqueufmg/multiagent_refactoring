    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarators",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes and a total of 82 LOC, with individual classes ranging ~11–19 LOC and low complexity (WM C values 1–3, small number of methods). These counts are small and do not indicate an excessively large component; dependencies show modest efferent coupling (Ce=5) and no incoming coupling (Ca=0). Based on the provided size and complexity metrics, there is no evidence this package is a God Component."
