    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.range",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 10 LOC (each class ~5 LOC). Class-level metrics show very low complexity (wmc=1), no fields/methods beyond minimal, and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin/fanout = 0). These values indicate the component is small and not excessively large in LOC or number of classes, so the God Component smell is not present."
