    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a large number of classes (37) and a high total size (2451 LOC), indicating substantial size at the package level. Several classes are individually large and complex (e.g. MethodCallExprContext: 312 LOC, WMC 86; CompilationUnitContext: 241 LOC, WMC 65; AbstractJavaParserContext: 187 LOC, WMC 49; StatementContext: 178 LOC, WMC 47; JavaParserTypeDeclarationAdapter: 166 LOC, WMC 48), showing concentrated responsibilities and high internal complexity. The package also exhibits notable coupling (Ce=25, Ca=6) and many dependencies across core resolution and AST subsystems, suggesting it centralizes functionality. Taken together — high class count, high total LOC, multiple very large/complex classes, and broad coupling — this supports identifying the package as a God Component."
