    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "extends_duplicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and a total of 8 LOC (class LOCs: 4, 2, 2). Class-level metrics show zero complexity (wmc=0), no methods/fields, and no incoming/outgoing dependencies. Given the very small size and lack of internal/external coupling, there is no evidence of an excessively large component, so the God Component smell is not present."
