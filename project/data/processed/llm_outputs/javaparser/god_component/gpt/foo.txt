    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "foo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package 'foo' contains 15 classes but a total of only 71 LOC, yielding a very small average size per class (~4.7 LOC). Individual classes are all small (examples: Main 7 LOC, several A/Foo/etc. 4–9 LOC, many inner/auxiliary classes 1–4 LOC). Complexity metrics (wmc) are low across classes and fan-in/fan-out are 0 for most, indicating low coupling. There is no single large class or concentrated large LOC/method complexity that would make this package 'excessively' large in code or class count. Therefore, based on the provided metrics and contextual judgment, this is not a God Component."
