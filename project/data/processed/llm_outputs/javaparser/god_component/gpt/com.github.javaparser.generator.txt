    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.generator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 5 classes and 325 LOC, which is not excessively large in terms of number of classes or total LOC. Although AbstractGenerator is disproportionately large within the package (165 LOC — ~50% of package LOC, 20 methods, WMC=28) and displays high complexity and responsibility (suggesting a God Class within the package), the package as a whole does not exhibit an excessive size by the provided metrics. Package coupling shows Ce=7 and Ca=0, indicating some outward dependencies but no incoming dependency concentration; this supports the view that responsibility is concentrated in a single class rather than the entire package being a God Component."
