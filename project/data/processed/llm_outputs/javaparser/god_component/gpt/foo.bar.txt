    "justification": "The package foo.bar contains 6 classes with a total of 20 LOC, which is small in both class count and size. Individual class LOC values range from 1 to 5 and most classes report nom=0, wmc=0 and minimal complexity metrics. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 for classes, package coupling Ce=0 and Ca=1, and there are only a few simple dependencies. There is no concentration of large code or high complexity that would indicate an excessively large (God) component."
