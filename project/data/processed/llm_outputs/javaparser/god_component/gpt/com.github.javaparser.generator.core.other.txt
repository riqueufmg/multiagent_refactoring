    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.other",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and a total of 122 LOC, which is small for a component considered 'excessively large'. Individual classes have modest sizes (LOC: 30, 44, 48) and low-to-moderate complexity (WMC: 4, 5, 9) and few methods (nom: 3–4). Coupling metrics do not indicate a massive centralized responsibility (Ca=0, Ce=5). Based on these elements, the package does not exhibit the excessive size or class count characteristic of a God Component."
