    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.serialization",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes and 290 LOC total, which is moderate in size. The two largest classes (JavaParserJsonDeserializer: 126 LOC, WMC 22; JavaParserJsonSerializer: 129 LOC, WMC 14) are not extremely large and are accompanied by four very small nested/helper classes (8–11 LOC each). The class count is low (6) and there is no evidence of an excessive concentration of responsibilities across many classes or extremely high LOC. Although efferent coupling (Ce = 12) is higher than afferent (Ca = 0), that indicates dependencies outward rather than a single oversized component. Based on these metrics and contextual judgment, this package does not qualify as a God Component."
