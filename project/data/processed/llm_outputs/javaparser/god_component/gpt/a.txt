    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Package 'a' contains 4 classes with a total of 22 LOC (individual class LOC: 8, 5, 5, 4). Class-level metrics show very low complexity (WMC 0-1), negligible method counts, and no fan-in/fan-out. The package has no external coupling (Ce=0, Ca=0). These values indicate the component is small and not excessively large, so it does not meet the God Component smell."
