    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes and 508 LOC overall, which is not excessively large for a single component. Class-level metrics show one relatively larger class (Comment: loc 158, nom 35, wmc 43) and one medium class (MarkdownComment: loc 111, nom 15, wmc 24), but the remaining classes are small (loc 36–53). The size and number of classes are distributed rather than concentrated into a single overwhelmingly large component, and dependencies are moderate. Based on this data, the package does not exhibit the extreme size or number of classes indicative of a God Component."
