    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.example",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes and a total of 34 LOC, which is small overall. Individual classes are tiny (LOC ranges 2–11, max 11), with low complexity metrics (wmc mostly 0–1) and low coupling (Ce=1, Ca=0, fanin/fanout mostly 0). No single class or the package as a whole appears excessively large in LOC or number of classes, so the God Component smell is not detected."
