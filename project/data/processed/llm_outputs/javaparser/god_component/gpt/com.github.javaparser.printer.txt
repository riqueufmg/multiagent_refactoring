    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 13 classes but is very large (3974 LOC). Two classes dominate the package size and complexity: DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor (1688 LOC, 124 methods, WMC 354, 106 non-private methods) and PrettyPrintVisitor (1588 LOC, 122 methods, WMC 346, 107 non-private methods). Together they account for ~3276 LOC (~82% of the package) and extremely high complexity/number-of-methods, indicating concentrated responsibilities. Additional supporting classes (SourcePrinter 181 LOC, ConcreteSyntaxModel 158 LOC) are much smaller. The concentration of LOC, high method counts and WMC in a few classes, plus many dependencies, support the judgment that this package contains a God Component that is excessively large and likely taking on too many responsibilities."
