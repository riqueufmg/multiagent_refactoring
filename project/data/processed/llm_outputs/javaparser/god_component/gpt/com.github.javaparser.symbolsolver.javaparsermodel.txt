    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 8 classes but a high total of 1736 LOC with most of the size concentrated in a few very large and complex classes: JavaParserFacade (loc 494, nom 39, wmc 108), TypeExtractor (loc 423, nom 38, wmc 128), DefaultVisitorAdapter (loc 311, nom 103, wmc 103) and NormalCompletionVisitor (loc 198, nom 18, wmc 43). These few classes account for the majority of the package LOC and show very high method counts and complexity metrics, indicating excessive size and responsibility concentrated in a small number of classes within the component. Based on this concentration of LOC and complexity, the package qualifies as a God Component."
