    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.parametrization",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes and 152 LOC in total, which is not excessively large for a component. The largest class, ResolvedTypeParametersMap, is 84 LOC with 12 methods and WMC 17 — somewhat complex but not so large that it dominates the package. Other classes are small (ResolvedTypeParameterValueProvider 38 LOC, ResolvedTypeParametrized 7 LOC, Builder 23 LOC). Package coupling is low (Ce=2, Ca=5) and the responsibilities appear concentrated and related to type parameter parametrization. Based on this contextual information, the package does not exhibit the excessive size or number of classes characteristic of a God Component."
