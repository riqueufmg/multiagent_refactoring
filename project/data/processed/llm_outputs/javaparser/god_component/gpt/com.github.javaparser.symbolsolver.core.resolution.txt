    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.core.resolution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and a total of 17 LOC, which is very small for a component. Individual classes have very low LOC (3, 11, 3), low complexity (WMC = 1 each), low coupling within the package (fanin = 0, fanout = 0 for classes), and shallow inheritance (DIT = 0). Although the package has some external dependencies (Ce = 6, Ca = 7), there is no evidence of an excessive number of classes or large amount of code that would indicate a God Component."
