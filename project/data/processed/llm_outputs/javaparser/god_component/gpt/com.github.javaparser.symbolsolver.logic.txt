    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.logic",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 101 total LOC, with the largest class at 54 LOC and the others at 40 and 7 LOC. Complexity metrics are modest (max WMC = 8, NCs are small) and no single class dominates the package in size or responsibility. Although there are several dependencies (Ce=9, Ca=6), the package is not excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of classes, so it does not meet the God Component smell criteria."
