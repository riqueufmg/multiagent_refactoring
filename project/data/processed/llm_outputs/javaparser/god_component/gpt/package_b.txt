    "detection": false,
    "justification": "package_b contains a single class with only 2 lines of code (loc=2, num_classes=1). Class-level metrics show no methods or complexity (nof=0, nom=0, wmc=0) and there are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (Ca=0, Ce=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). These characteristics indicate the component is minimal, not excessively large, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
