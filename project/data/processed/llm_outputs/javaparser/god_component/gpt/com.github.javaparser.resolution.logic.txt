    "justification": "The package totals 1322 LOC across 7 classes, but one class (MethodResolutionLogic) is extremely large: 803 LOC (≈61% of the package), 31 methods (nom) and very high WMC (211). Other sizable classes include InferenceContext (205 LOC, WMC 58) and ConstructorResolutionLogic (145 LOC, WMC 36). The package therefore shows a strong concentration of code and complexity in a single class (and a few large classes), indicating an excessively large component by LOC and complexity even though the number of classes is modest."
