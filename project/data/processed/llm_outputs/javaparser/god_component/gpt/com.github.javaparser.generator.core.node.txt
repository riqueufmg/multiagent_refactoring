    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes and 360 LOC (average ~40 LOC/class) which is not excessively large. Classes are focused generator types (PropertyGenerator, RemoveMethodGenerator, TypeCastingGenerator, etc.), indicating single responsibilities. The largest class is PropertyGenerator at 118 LOC and WMC 23 — notable but not dominant given the overall package size. Class-level fanin/fanout are 0 and package afferent coupling Ca is 0 (not a central monolith), with moderate efferent coupling Ce=7. Overall size, cohesion by role, and moderate complexity do not support labeling this package a God Component."
