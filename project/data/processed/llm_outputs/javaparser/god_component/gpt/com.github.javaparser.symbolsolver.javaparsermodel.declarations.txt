    "justification": "The package is substantially large and heterogeneous: 24 classes and 2,568 LOC overall. Multiple classes are individually large (JavaParserRecordDeclaration: 401 LOC, JavaParserEnumDeclaration: 341 LOC, JavaParserClassDeclaration: 271 LOC, JavaParserInterfaceDeclaration: 233 LOC, JavaParserTypeParameter: 149 LOC, JavaParserTypeAdapter: 135 LOC). Several of these also show high complexity (WMC examples: RecordDeclaration 85, ClassDeclaration 76, InterfaceDeclaration 67, EnumDeclaration 56, TypeParameter 42, TypeAdapter 41). The package implements many declaration kinds (class, enum, record, interface, annotation, type parameter, etc.), indicating broad responsibilities concentrated in a single component. Together, the size (LOC, number of classes) and concentrated complexity justify detecting a God Component smell."
