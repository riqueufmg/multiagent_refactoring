    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is excessively large in size and concentrated responsibility: total LOC = 18,663 across 54 classes, with extremely large classes inside the package (GeneratedJavaParser: 10,520 LOC, 789 methods, WMC 5113; GeneratedJavaParserTokenManager: 2,353 LOC, WMC 1130; JavaToken: 404 LOC; UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider: 458 LOC). A single class (GeneratedJavaParser) dominates the package, carrying very high complexity and many methods, and the package has high incoming coupling (Ca = 52), indicating it is a central, heavily depended-upon component. These factors together indicate an excessive size and concentration of responsibilities consistent with a God Component."
