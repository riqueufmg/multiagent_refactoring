    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.modifiers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 8 classes with a total of 88 LOC, with individual class sizes ranging from 5 to 14 LOC. Class complexities (WMC) are very low (0–2), and coupling metrics are minimal (package Ce=0, Ca=0; per-class fanin/fanout = 0). There is no single large/dominant class or very high LOC count that would indicate an excessively large component, so this package does not qualify as a God Component."
