    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.constraintformulas",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes and 433 LOC, which is moderate in size and not excessively large in either class count or total LOC. The largest class (ExpressionCompatibleWithType) is 165 LOC with a high WMC (45), but the remaining classes range from 26–60 LOC, so LOC and complexity are not concentrated across many classes. Incoming coupling is low (Ca = 1) and class fan-in values are 0, indicating the package is not a highly central, monolithic component relied upon by many others. Based on the provided distribution and coupling metrics, there is insufficient evidence to classify this package as a God Component."
