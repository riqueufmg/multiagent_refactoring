    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The provided data shows JavassistRecordDeclaration has many outgoing dependencies (11): Context, SymbolReference, AccessSpecifier, ResolvedType, TypeSolver, JavassistFactory, JavassistUtils, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, Node, ResolvedReferenceType, JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter. However, it has zero incoming dependencies. Because incoming dependency count is 0, the class does not meet the definition (requires both incoming and outgoing connections) and therefore is not detected as a hub."
