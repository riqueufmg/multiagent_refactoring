    "justification": "CsmNone has 0 incoming dependencies and 2 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. With no incoming dependencies and only two outgoing dependencies, CsmNone does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module. (Note: the outgoing target classes have many dependencies themselves, but the smell is evaluated for CsmNone in isolation.)"
