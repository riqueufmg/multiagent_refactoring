    "justification": "HasParentNode has only one outgoing dependency: com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, and there are no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections. Although the Node class (which HasParentNode depends on) has many outgoing dependencies (e.g., com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitor, com.github.javaparser.Position, com.github.javaparser.printer.Printer, com.github.javaparser.Range, etc.), HasParentNode itself does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies and therefore is not a hub."
