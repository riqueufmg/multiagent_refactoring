    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.JarTypeSolver). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low fan-in/fan-out, so the smell is not detected."
