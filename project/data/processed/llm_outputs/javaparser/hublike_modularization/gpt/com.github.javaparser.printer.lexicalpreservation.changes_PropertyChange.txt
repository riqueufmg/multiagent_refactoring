    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.changes.PropertyChange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PropertyChange has only outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows neither a large outgoing fan‑out nor any incoming dependencies, so the smell is not present."
