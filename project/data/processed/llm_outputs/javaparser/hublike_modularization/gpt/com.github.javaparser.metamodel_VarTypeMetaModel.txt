    "justification": "VarTypeMetaModel has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 2 incoming dependency sources: com.github.javaparser.ast.type.VarType and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel (both list com.github.javaparser.metamodel.VarTypeMetaModel in their dependencies). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
