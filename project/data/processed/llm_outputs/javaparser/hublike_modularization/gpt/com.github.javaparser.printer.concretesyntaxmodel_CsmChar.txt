    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected: CsmChar has only outgoing dependencies to 3 other abstractions (com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node) and has no incoming dependencies. The smell requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships; CsmChar does not exhibit a large number of connections in either direction based on the provided data."
