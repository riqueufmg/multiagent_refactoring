    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []) and no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here both dependency counts are zero, so the smell is not present."
