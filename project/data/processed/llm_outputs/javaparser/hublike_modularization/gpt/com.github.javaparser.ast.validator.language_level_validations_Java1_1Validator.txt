    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator and com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration). Considering the class in isolation, it does not have both many incoming and many outgoing dependency relationships required to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
