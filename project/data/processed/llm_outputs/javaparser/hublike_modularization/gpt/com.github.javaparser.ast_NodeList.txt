    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NodeList has a very large number of incoming dependencies from many classes (examples: com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.DefaultVisitorAdapter, JavaParserFacade, TypeExtractor; many ast.* types such as com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ClassOrInterfaceType, ArrayType, PrimitiveType, UnionType; numerous visitor and printer classes such as com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, PrettyPrintVisitor; and many others across the input). However, NodeList's outgoing dependencies are small: only com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitor, com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitor, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node and com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.AstObserver are listed. The hub-like modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies in both directions with a large number of other abstractions; here only the incoming side is large while the outgoing side is limited, so the smell is not detected."
