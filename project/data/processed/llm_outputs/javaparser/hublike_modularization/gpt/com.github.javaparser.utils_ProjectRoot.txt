    "justification": "ProjectRoot has 4 incoming dependencies (SymbolSolverCollectionStrategy, CollectionStrategy, ParserCollectionStrategy, demo.Main) but only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming AND many outgoing dependencies. Here incoming count = 4 and outgoing count = 1, so ProjectRoot does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
