    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (demo.Main) and 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies; although SourceRoot itself depends on many types, demo.Main.Callback directly references only SourceRoot, so it does not act as a hub."
