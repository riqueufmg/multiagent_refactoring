    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ConfigurationOption is referenced by several other classes (incoming dependencies from DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor, PrinterConfiguration, DefaultConfigurationOption, DefaultPrinterConfiguration, PrettyPrinterConfiguration — 5 incoming). However, it has no outgoing dependencies (empty dependencies list). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here only incoming are present while outgoing are zero, so the smell is not detected."
