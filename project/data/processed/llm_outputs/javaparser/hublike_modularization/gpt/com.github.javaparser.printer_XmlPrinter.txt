    "justification": "Not detected. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. XmlPrinter has 0 incoming dependencies and only 4 direct outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList, com.github.javaparser.metamodel.NodeMetaModel, com.github.javaparser.utils.Utils, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node. Although com.github.javaparser.ast.Node (one of the outgoing dependencies) itself references many other types, those are transitive relationships; per the constraint to analyze the class in isolation, only XmlPrinter's direct incoming/outgoing counts are considered (incoming=0, outgoing=4), which does not constitute a hub."
