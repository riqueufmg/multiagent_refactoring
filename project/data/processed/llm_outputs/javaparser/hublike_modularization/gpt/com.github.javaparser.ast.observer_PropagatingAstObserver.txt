    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.PropagatingAstObserver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PropagatingAstObserver has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions: com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.AstObserver, and com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList. It has a single incoming dependency shown: com.github.javaparser.ast.Node depends on PropagatingAstObserver. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the incoming count is 1 and the outgoing count is 4, which does not constitute a large number of bidirectional connections, so the smell is not detected."
