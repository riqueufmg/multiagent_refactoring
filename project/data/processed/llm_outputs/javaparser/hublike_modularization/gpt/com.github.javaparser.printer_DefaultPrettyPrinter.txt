    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DefaultPrettyPrinter has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (4: com.github.javaparser.printer.Printer, com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitor, com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.PrinterConfiguration, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node) and a single incoming dependency (1: com.github.javaparser.generator.metamodel.MetaModelGenerator). Although some of those target types (notably VoidVisitor and Node) themselves reference many other abstractions, the provided data shows DefaultPrettyPrinter does not directly depend on a large number of different abstractions. Therefore it does not meet the definition of a hub-like modularization (which requires many incoming and outgoing relationships)."
