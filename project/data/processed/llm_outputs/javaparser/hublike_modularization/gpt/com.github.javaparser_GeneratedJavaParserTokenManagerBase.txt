    "class": "com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserTokenManagerBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions: TokenTypes, TokenRange, Comment, Token, MarkdownComment, JavaToken. It has only 1 incoming dependency (GeneratedJavaParserTokenManager). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing dependencies are moderate but incoming dependencies are minimal, so this class does not meet the hub-like pattern."
