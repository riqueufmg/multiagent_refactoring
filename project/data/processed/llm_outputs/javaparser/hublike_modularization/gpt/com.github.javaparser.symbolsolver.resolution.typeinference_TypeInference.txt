    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeInference has a large number of outgoing dependencies (many collaborators such as InferenceVariable, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, SubtypeOfBound, TypeSolver, Expression, JavaParserFacade, InstantiationSet, ResolvedType, TypeInferenceCache, BoundSet, ConstraintFormulaSet, MethodUsage, Substitution, LambdaExpr, MethodReferenceExpr, ExpressionCompatibleWithType, etc.), but only a single incoming dependency is shown (ExpressionCompatibleWithType depends on TypeInference). Hub-like Modularization requires both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; since incoming dependencies are minimal (1) while outgoing are many, TypeInference does not meet the full criteria for a hub-like module in the provided data."
