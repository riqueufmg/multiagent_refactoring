    "justification": "The class has a very large number of outgoing dependencies (numerous AST node and meta-model types such as TraditionalJavadocComment, UnaryExpr, MethodDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, Node, CompilationUnit, RecordPatternExpr, etc.), but it has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here only the outgoing side is large while the incoming side is absent, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
