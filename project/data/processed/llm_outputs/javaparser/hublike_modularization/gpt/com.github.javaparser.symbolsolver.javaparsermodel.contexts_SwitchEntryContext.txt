    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SwitchEntryContext has many outgoing dependencies (14 distinct dependencies including TypeSolver, Navigator, JavaParserFacade, ResolvedType, AbstractJavaParserContext, SwitchStmt, SwitchEntry, Node, JavaParserFactory, ReferenceTypeImpl, SymbolReference, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, SymbolDeclarator, SwitchNode) but zero incoming dependencies in the provided data. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have numerous incoming and outgoing relationships; since there are no incoming dependencies, the class does not meet the hub-like criterion."
