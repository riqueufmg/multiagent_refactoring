    "justification": "Not detected: Hub-like Modularization requires the class to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The provided data shows zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only five outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BaseNodeMetaModel, com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.BlockStmt, com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot). Because there are no incoming links and the number of outgoing links is small, this class does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
