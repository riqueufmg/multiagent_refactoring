    "justification": "FileUtils has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.JavaParserTypeSolver). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing links); these counts do not meet that criterion."
