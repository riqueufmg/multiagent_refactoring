    "justification": "SymbolResolver has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (5): com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Type. It has a small number of direct incoming dependencies (4): com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserMethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration. Although some of those referenced types (e.g., Expression, Node) themselves list many internal dependencies, the analysis must consider SymbolResolver in isolation and count its direct incoming/outgoing relationships — those counts are not large enough to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
