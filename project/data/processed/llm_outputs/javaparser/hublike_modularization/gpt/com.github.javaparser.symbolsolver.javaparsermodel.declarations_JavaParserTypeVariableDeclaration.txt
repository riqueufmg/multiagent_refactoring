    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserTypeVariableDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has many outgoing dependencies (12 distinct abstractions: Context, SymbolReference, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, JavaParserFacade, AstResolutionUtils, ResolvedType, ResolvedFieldDeclaration, TypeSolver, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, Node, Type, TypeParameter) but only a single incoming dependency recorded (JavaParserFacade). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although there is bidirectional coupling with JavaParserFacade, the incoming coupling count is low (1) while outgoing is high (12), so the class does not meet the definition of a hub (many incoming and many outgoing)."
