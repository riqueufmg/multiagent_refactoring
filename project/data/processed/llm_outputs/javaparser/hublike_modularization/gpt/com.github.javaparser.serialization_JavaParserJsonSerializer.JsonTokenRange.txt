    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.serialization.JavaParserJsonSerializer). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here the analyzed class is connected to a single other class and has no outgoing links, so the hub condition is not met. Note: the incoming class's own many dependencies do not make this class a hub in isolation."
