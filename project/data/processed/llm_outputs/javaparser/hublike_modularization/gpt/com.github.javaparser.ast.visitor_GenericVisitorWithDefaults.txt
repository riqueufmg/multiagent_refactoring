    "justification": "The class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (104 distinct target abstractions, e.g. com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MethodCallExpr), but there are no incoming dependencies in the provided data (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections; here the incoming side is absent, so the smell is not detected."
