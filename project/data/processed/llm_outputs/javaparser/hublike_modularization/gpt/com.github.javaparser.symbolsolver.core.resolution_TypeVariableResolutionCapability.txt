    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (incoming_dependencies is empty). Outgoing dependencies: only 2 distinct abstractions (com.github.javaparser.resolution.Context, com.github.javaparser.resolution.MethodUsage). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has no incoming dependencies and a small number of outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
