    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CsmIndent has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElement, com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty), CsmIndent does not qualify as a hub. Note: although the outgoing targets themselves depend on many other types, the class is analyzed in isolation and still lacks the required high number of incoming couplings."
