    "justification": "Not a hub: JavassistFieldDeclaration has outgoing dependencies to 5 abstractions (com.github.javaparser.ast.AccessSpecifier, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistFactory, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeDeclaration) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming dependencies are absent, so the hub smell is not detected."
