    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeInferenceCache has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (3: com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.LambdaExpr) and only two incoming dependents (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeInference and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.constraintformulas.ExpressionCompatibleWithType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows limited incoming (2) and outgoing (3) connections. Per the constraint to consider the class in isolation, this connectivity is not large enough to classify it as a hub."
