    "justification": "Preconditions is not hub-like: it has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 4 incoming dependencies (A, B, com.github.javaparser.StaticJavaParser, com.example.ConstructorParameterTest). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing=0, so the smell does not apply."
