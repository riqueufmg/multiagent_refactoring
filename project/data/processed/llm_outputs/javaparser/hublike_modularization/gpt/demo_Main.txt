    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. demo.Main has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 4 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.utils.ParserCollectionStrategy, com.github.javaparser.utils.ProjectRoot, demo.Main.Callback, com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot). Because there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing set is small, demo.Main does not meet the hub-like criteria."
