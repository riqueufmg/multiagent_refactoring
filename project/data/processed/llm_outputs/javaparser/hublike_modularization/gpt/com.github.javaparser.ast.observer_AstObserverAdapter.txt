    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.AstObserverAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AstObserverAdapter has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming dependency count is zero and the outgoing count is small, so this class is not a hub."
