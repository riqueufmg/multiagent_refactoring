    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmConditional.Condition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only a single incoming dependency from com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmConditional. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the analyzed class interacts with very few other abstractions (0 outgoing, 1 incoming), so it is not a hub."
