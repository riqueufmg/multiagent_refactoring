    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TokenMgrException has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserTokenManager). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here both counts are not large (outgoing=0, incoming=1), so the smell is not present."
