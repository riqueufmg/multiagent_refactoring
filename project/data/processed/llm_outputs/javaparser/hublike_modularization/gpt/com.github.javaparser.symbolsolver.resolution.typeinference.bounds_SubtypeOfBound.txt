    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SubtypeOfBound has a small number of direct relationships: 3 outgoing dependencies (InferenceVariableSubstitution, TypeHelper, ResolvedType) and 2 incoming dependents (TypeInference, BoundSet). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The direct IN/OUT counts here (3 outgoing, 2 incoming) are low. Note: although the outgoing dependency TypeHelper itself lists many dependencies, those are indirect and do not make SubtypeOfBound a hub by the provided direct-dependency data."
