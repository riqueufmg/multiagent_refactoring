    "justification": "NullType has very few direct dependencies: outgoing = 1 (com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType) and incoming = 1 (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.TypeExtractor). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependency relations with a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows NullType is only directly connected to ResolvedType (outgoing) and referenced by TypeExtractor (incoming), so it does not exhibit hub-like characteristics."
