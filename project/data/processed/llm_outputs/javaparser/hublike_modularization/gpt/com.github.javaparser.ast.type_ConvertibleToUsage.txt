    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ConvertibleToUsage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ConvertibleToUsage has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.Context, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; here incoming is empty and outgoing is small. Although ResolvedType itself lists many dependencies, the analysis must consider the class in isolation, so those transitive links do not make ConvertibleToUsage a hub."
