    "class": "com.github.javaparser.UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 5 outgoing dependencies (UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider.PositionMappingBuilder, Provider, UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider.LineCounter, UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider.PositionUpdate, UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider.PositionMapping) and only 2 incoming dependents (ParserConfiguration, ParserConfiguration.UnicodeEscapeProcessor). Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here the counts are small and the outgoing links are primarily to closely related nested/helper types, so this class does not exhibit a hub-like smell."
