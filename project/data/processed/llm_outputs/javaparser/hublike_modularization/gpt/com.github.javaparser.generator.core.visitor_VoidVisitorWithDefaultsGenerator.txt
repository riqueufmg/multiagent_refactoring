    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.VoidVisitorWithDefaultsGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to five other abstractions (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BaseNodeMetaModel, com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.BlockStmt, com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming AND outgoing connections; here incoming connections are absent, so the class is not a hub. Note: several of the outgoing dependencies themselves are highly connected, but that does not make the analyzed class a hub in isolation."
