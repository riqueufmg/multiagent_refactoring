    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ThrowStmtMetaModel has a small number of dependencies: 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and 2 incoming dependents (com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ThrowStmt and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing links with a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows only a few direct connections, so ThrowStmtMetaModel does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
