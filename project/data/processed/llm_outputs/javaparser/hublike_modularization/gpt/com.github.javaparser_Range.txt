    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The provided data shows that Range has a very large number of incoming dependencies from many AST and utility classes (examples: com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Type, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression, com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.Statement, com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.Comment, com.github.javaparser.utils.PositionUtils, com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalPreservingPrinter, com.github.javaparser.serialization.JavaParserJsonSerializer, etc.). However, Range has only a single outgoing dependency in the provided data: com.github.javaparser.Position (and Position itself depends on Node). Because the definition of Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies in both directions with a large number of other abstractions, Range does not qualify: it has high incoming coupling but low outgoing coupling (outgoing degree = 1), so the smell is not detected."
