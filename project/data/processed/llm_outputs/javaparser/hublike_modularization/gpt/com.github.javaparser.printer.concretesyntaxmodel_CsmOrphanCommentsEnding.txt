    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 4 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.Comment, com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmComment, com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming dependencies are absent and the direct outgoing set is small, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
