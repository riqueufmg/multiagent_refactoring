    "detection": true,
    "justification": "FieldAccessExpr has a large number of outgoing dependencies (13): NameExpr, VoidVisitor, FieldAccessExprMetaModel, Range, Expression, NodeList, ResolvedValueDeclaration, SimpleName, TokenRange, ObservableProperty, JavaParserMetaModel, Node, GenericVisitor. It also has many incoming dependencies (27) from a wide variety of other abstractions, notably many visitor implementations and utilities (e.g., VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, HashCodeVisitor, EqualsVisitor, PrettyPrintVisitor, DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor, VoidVisitorAdapter, GenericVisitorAdapter, CloneVisitor, NodeFinderVisitor) and symbol-solver / parser components (e.g., JavaParserFacade, TypeExtractor, FieldAccessContext, AbstractJavaParserContext, NameLogic, GeneratedJavaParser, GeneratedJavaParserBase). The presence of many incoming clients combined with many outgoing links to core AST, meta-model, visitor and resolution types indicates FieldAccessExpr acts as a central hub, satisfying the Hub-like Modularization smell."
