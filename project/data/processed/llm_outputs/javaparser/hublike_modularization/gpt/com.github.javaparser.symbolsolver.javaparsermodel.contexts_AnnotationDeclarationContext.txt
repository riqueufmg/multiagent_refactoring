    "justification": "AnnotationDeclarationContext has outgoing dependencies to 5 other abstractions (com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.AnnotationDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.JavaParserTypeDeclarationAdapter, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies (acting as a central hub). Because there are no incoming dependencies, the class does not meet the hub-like criterion."
