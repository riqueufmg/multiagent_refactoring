    "detection": true,
    "justification": "JavaParserFactory has a large number of incoming dependencies (≈27 distinct classes across com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver, .javaparsermodel, .javaparsermodel.declarations, .javaparsermodel.contexts, .resolution, etc.) — examples include JavaParserFacade, TypeExtractor, JavaParserClassDeclaration, JavaParserMethodDeclaration, numerous context classes (BlockStmtContext, StatementContext, LambdaExprContext, AnonymousClassDeclarationContext), NameLogic, SymbolSolver and JavaSymbolSolver. It also has multiple outgoing dependencies (9 distinct classes) to core AST and resolution types such as com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.resolution.Navigator, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, ForStmt, ForEachStmt, ExpressionStmt, Context and SymbolDeclarator. The presence of many incoming relationships from varied modules combined with multiple outgoing links to core abstractions indicates the class functions as a central connector (hub) between many other abstractions, satisfying the Hub-like Modularization smell."
