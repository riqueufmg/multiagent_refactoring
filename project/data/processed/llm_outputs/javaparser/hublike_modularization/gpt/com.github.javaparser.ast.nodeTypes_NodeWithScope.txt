    "justification": "NodeWithScope has only one direct outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression) and no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data does not show multiple direct incoming/outgoing relations for this class. (Note: Expression itself lists many dependencies, but those are not direct dependencies of NodeWithScope in the given data.)"
