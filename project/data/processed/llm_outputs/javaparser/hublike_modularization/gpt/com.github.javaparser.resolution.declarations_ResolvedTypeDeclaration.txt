    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ResolvedTypeDeclaration has a high out-degree (7 outgoing dependencies: ResolvedInterfaceDeclaration, ResolvedEnumDeclaration, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedClassDeclaration, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ResolvedAnnotationDeclaration, ResolvedRecordDeclaration) and a high in-degree (20 distinct incoming dependents in the provided data). Incoming dependents include core components and many declaration adapters/consumers such as JavaParserFacade, TypeExtractor, SymbolSolver, MethodResolutionLogic, JavaParserClassDeclaration, JavaParserInterfaceDeclaration, JavaParserRecordDeclaration, JavaParserFieldDeclaration, ReflectionFieldDeclaration, CompilationUnitContext, etc. The presence of many both incoming and outgoing links (multiple core resolver and parser components depending on it while it depends on many specific declaration types) matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
