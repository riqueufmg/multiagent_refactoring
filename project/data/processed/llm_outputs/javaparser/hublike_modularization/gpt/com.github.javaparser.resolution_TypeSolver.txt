    "justification": "The class has a large number of incoming dependencies (~125 distinct classes reference it, e.g. com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.JavaSymbolSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.CombinedTypeSolver, various reflectionmodel.* and many javaparsermodel.contexts). However, its outgoing dependencies are small (3: com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.resolution.UnsolvedSymbolException). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here only incoming is large while outgoing is minimal, so the smell is not detected."
