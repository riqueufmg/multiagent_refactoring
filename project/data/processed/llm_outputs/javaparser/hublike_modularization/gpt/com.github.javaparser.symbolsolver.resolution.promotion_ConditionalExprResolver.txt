    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ConditionalExprResolver has a small number of direct relationships: 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.promotion.ConditionalExprHandler, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedPrimitiveType) and a single incoming dependency (referenced by com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.TypeExtractor). Although one of its outgoing types (ResolvedType) itself lists many dependencies, ConditionalExprResolver directly depends on only three abstractions and is referenced by only one abstraction in the provided data. Therefore it does not meet the criterion of having a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies required for hub-like modularization."
