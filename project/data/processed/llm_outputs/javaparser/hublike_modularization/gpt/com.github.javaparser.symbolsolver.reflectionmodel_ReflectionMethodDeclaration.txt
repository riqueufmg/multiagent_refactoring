    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ReflectionMethodDeclaration has a high number of outgoing dependencies (10) spanning many different abstractions and packages — e.g. Context, MethodUsage, AccessSpecifier, ResolvedParameterDeclaration, ResolvedType, AbstractTypeDeclaration, TypeSolver, TypeUtils, ReflectionFactory, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration — indicating broad coupling outward. It is also referenced by multiple other components (4 distinct incoming classes: ReflectionClassDeclaration, ReflectionRecordDeclaration, ReflectionTypeParameter, ReflectionMethodResolutionLogic) that rely on it. The combination of substantial fan-out across diverse subsystems and multiple fan-in callers shows it functions as a central hub-like abstraction."
