    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NoCommentEqualsVisitor has a very large number of outgoing dependencies (it references many AST node and related types such as com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MethodCallExpr, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.TraditionalJavadocComment, com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList, etc.), but the provided data shows zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; because this class has no incoming dependencies in the given data, it does not meet the definition of a hub."
