    "justification": "ConstructorContext has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions: com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.ConstructorDeclaration, and com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies (e.g., ConstructorDeclaration -> 17 deps, Node -> 24 deps, TypeSolver -> 3 deps), the analyzed class lacks incoming connections, so it does not meet the definition of a hub."
