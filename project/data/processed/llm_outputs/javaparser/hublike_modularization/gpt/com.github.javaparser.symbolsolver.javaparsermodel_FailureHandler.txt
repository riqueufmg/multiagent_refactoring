    "justification": "FailureHandler has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has a single incoming dependency from com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; FailureHandler has only one incoming and zero outgoing, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
