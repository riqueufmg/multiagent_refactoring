    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are limited (6): JavaParserFacade, ResolvedType, TypeSolver, Parameter, JavaParserFactory, ResolvedArrayType. Incoming dependencies are minimal (1): referenced by com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserSymbolDeclaration. A hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; this class shows only a small set of outgoing dependencies and a single incoming dependency, so it is not a hub."
