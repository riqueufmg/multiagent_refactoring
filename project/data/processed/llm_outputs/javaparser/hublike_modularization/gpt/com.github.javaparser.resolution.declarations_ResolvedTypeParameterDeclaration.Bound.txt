    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the analyzed class does not show the required fan-in/fan-out. (Although ResolvedType itself depends on multiple types, the analyzed class in isolation does not.)"
