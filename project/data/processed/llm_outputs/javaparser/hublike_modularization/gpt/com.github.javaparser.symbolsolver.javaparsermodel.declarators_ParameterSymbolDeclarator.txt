    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. ParameterSymbolDeclarator has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.Parameter, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserSymbolDeclaration). The absence of incoming dependencies means it does not act as a hub despite the outgoing links; therefore the smell is not detected."
