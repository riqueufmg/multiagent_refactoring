    "detection": false,
    "justification": "HairTypeRenderer has only 1 incoming dependency (issue1945.main.MainIssue1945) and 2 outgoing dependencies (issue1945.interfaces.HairyAnimal, issue1945.interfaces.HairType). The class interacts with a small, fixed set of other abstractions rather than a large number of incoming and outgoing connections, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
