    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 2 (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils.SymbolSolverCollectionStrategy, com.foo.Widget). Outgoing dependencies: 7 (SymbolReference; InMemoryCache; TypeSolver; CombinedTypeSolver.ExceptionHandlers; UnsolvedSymbolException; ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration; Cache). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. Although CombinedTypeSolver has multiple outgoing dependencies across packages, it has only 2 incoming dependents in the provided data, so it does not meet the 'hub-like' criterion in isolation."
