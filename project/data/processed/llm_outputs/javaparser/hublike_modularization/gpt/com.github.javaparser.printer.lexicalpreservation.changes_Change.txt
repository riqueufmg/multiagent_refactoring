    "justification": "Direct outgoing dependencies count = 4 (com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty, com.github.javaparser.utils.Utils, com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmConditional, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node). Direct incoming dependencies count = 1 (com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalDifferenceCalculator). Because Change has a small number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. Note: some target classes have many dependencies themselves, but per the isolation constraint the Change class is evaluated only by its own direct incoming/outgoing links."
