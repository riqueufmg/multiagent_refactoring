    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (from com.github.javaparser.javadoc.description.JavadocInlineTag and com.github.javaparser.javadoc.description.JavadocDescription). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class lacks outgoing dependencies and has only a small number of incoming dependents, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
