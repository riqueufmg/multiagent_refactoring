    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. ResolvedParameterDeclaration has many incoming dependencies (15 distinct callers shown, e.g. com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.JavaSymbolSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.declarations.common.MethodDeclarationCommonLogic, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionMethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserMethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.Parameter, com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.MethodResolutionLogic), but its outgoing_dependencies list is empty. Because it lacks outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the definition requirement of having both extensive incoming and outgoing dependency ties and therefore is not detected as Hub-like Modularization."
