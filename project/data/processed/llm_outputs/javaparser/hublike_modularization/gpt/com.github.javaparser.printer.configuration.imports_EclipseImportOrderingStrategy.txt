    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. EclipseImportOrderingStrategy has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList). Although NodeList itself depends on four other abstractions, those are dependencies of NodeList, not direct incoming/outgoing relations of EclipseImportOrderingStrategy. Therefore it is not a hub-like modularization."
