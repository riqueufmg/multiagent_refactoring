    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JavassistClassDeclaration has 13 outgoing dependencies (Context, SymbolReference, AccessSpecifier, ResolvedType, TypeSolver, JavassistInterfaceDeclaration, JavassistFactory, Node, JavassistUtils, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ResolvedReferenceType, JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter, etc.) but only 3 incoming dependents (JavassistEnumDeclaration, JavassistInterfaceDeclaration, JavassistUtils). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing connections. Here incoming coupling is small and the outgoing dependencies are largely to closely related types (several other javassistmodel classes and resolution/type system types), so it does not qualify as a hub."
