    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. MemoryTypeSolver has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration) and 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies, it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
