    "justification": "CapturesBound has only 1 outgoing dependency (to com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.InferenceVariableSubstitution) and only 1 incoming dependency source (referenced by com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet). Although BoundSet itself depends on many classes, CapturesBound is referenced by a single other abstraction and directly depends on just one abstraction. Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (no large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
