    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.NodeModifierGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NodeModifierGenerator has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (4 listed: CompilationUnit, SourceRoot, BaseNodeMetaModel, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections; since there are zero incoming and only a few outgoing, the smell is not present when the class is considered in isolation."
