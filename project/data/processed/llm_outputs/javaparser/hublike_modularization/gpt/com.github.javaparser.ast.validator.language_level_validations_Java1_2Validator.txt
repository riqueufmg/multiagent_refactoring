    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has only one outgoing dependency: com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator, and zero incoming dependencies. Outgoing count = 1 (Validator). Incoming count = 0. Therefore it does not exhibit a hub-like dependency pattern."
