    "justification": "ReplaceMethodGenerator has outgoing dependencies to 8 distinct abstractions (StaticJavaParser, BaseNodeMetaModel, BlockStmt, CompilationUnit, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, PropertyMetaModel, SourceRoot) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; because this class has zero incoming dependencies despite multiple outgoing ones, the hub-like smell is not detected."
