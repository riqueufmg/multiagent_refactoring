    "detection": true,
    "justification": "JavaParserFacade exhibits hub-like modularization: it has a large number of outgoing dependencies (51 distinct outgoing types) and is depended on by many other abstractions (37 distinct incoming types). Outgoing examples include numerous AST node and type classes (NameExpr, Expression, Node, MethodCallExpr, MethodReferenceExpr, ClassOrInterfaceType, Type, PrimitiveType, ArrayType, VoidType, WildcardType), resolution/core classes (ResolvedType, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, TypeSolver, MethodResolutionLogic, ConstructorResolutionLogic, Navigator, Solver, SymbolResolver, JavaSymbolSolver), and internal helpers (TypeExtractor, JavaParserFactory, FailureHandler). Incoming examples show many symbol-solver and context classes depending on it (JavaParserFieldDeclaration, JavaParserMethodDeclaration, JavaParserClassDeclaration, JavaParserEnumDeclaration, JavaParserTypeVariableDeclaration, JavaParserTypeParameter, JavaParserAnonymousClassDeclaration, JavaParserSymbolDeclaration, JavaParserFactory consumers, and many context classes such as MethodCallExprContext, LambdaExprContext, ObjectCreationContext, CompilationUnitContext). The combination of high fan-in and high fan-out across many modules and responsibilities indicates JavaParserFacade functions as a central hub and therefore matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
