    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Difference",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Difference has many outgoing dependencies (20 distinct abstractions, e.g. ChildTextElement, LexicalPreservingPrinter, NodeText, TokenTypes, JavaToken, TextElement, CsmElement, RemovedGroup, ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor) but only two incoming dependencies (from LexicalDifferenceCalculator and LexicalPreservingPrinter). Because the number of incoming dependents is small while outgoing references are many, the class does not exhibit the bidirectional 'hub' characteristic required for Hub-like Modularization."
