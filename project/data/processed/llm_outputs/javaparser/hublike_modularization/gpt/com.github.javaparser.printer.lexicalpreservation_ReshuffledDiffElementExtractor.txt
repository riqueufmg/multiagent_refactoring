    "justification": "ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor has outgoing dependencies to 9 distinct abstractions (PeekingIterator, NodeText, DifferenceElementCalculator, CsmMix, CsmElement, Reshuffled, ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor.MatchClassification, DifferenceElement, TextElement) but only a single incoming dependency from com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Difference. Because hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependency relationships, the class does not meet the criterion (many outgoing but not many incoming)."
