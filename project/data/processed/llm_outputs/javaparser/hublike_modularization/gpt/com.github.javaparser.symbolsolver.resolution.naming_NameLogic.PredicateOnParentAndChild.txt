    "justification": "PredicateOnParentAndChild has 0 outgoing dependencies (empty dependencies list) and only 1 incoming dependency (NameLogic). Although NameLogic depends on many types, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships; therefore it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
