    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JarTypeSolver has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions (SymbolReference, JavassistModuleHelper, TypeSolver, JavassistFactory, UnsolvedSymbolException, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration) but only 2 incoming dependents (TypeSolverBuilder, AarTypeSolver). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming dependency count is low (2), so it does not qualify as a hub."
