    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Cache class has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.resolution.cache.CacheStats) and only 2 incoming dependents (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.JavaParserTypeSolver and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.CombinedTypeSolver). Although the incoming classes have many other dependencies, the Cache itself is connected to a small number of other abstractions, so it does not constitute a hub-like modularization."
