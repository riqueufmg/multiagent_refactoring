    "justification": "TryStmtMetaModel has only one outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and only two incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.TryStmt and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Total incoming = 2, outgoing = 1, which is a low-degree interaction and does not constitute a hub (no large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies). Although JavaParserMetaModel itself references many meta-models (including TryStmtMetaModel), TryStmtMetaModel in isolation does not have many incoming/outgoing links, so Hub-like Modularization is not detected."
