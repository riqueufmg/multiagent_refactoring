    "justification": "ModuleLayerHelper is referenced by 2 other classes (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.ClassLoaderTypeSolver and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.ReflectionTypeSolver) but has 0 outgoing dependencies and no declared dependencies itself. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming count is small and there are no outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
