    "justification": "ConstraintFormula has only one incoming dependency (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ConstraintFormulaSet) and two direct outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ConstraintFormula.ReductionResult and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet). While BoundSet itself is highly connected to many abstractions, ConstraintFormula's own incoming and outgoing dependency counts are low and do not constitute a hub."
