    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of direct relationships: 4 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalDifferenceCalculator, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmToken, com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmElement) and 2 incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Difference, com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.RemovedGroup). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; here both incoming (2) and outgoing (4) counts are low. Note: although some of the outgoing target classes themselves have many dependencies, the analysis considers the Removed class in isolation and counts only its direct incoming/outgoing links, which are insufficient to classify it as a hub."
