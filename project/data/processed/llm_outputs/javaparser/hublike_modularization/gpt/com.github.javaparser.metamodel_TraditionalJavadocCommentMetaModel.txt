Incoming dependencies = 2 (referenced by com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.TraditionalJavadocComment and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). The class does not have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; it is only referenced by two classes, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
