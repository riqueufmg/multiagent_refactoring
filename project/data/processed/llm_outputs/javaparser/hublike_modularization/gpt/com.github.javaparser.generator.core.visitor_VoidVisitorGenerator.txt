    "detection": false,
    "justification": "VoidVisitorGenerator has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions: com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot, com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BaseNodeMetaModel. It has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing set is small and there are no incoming dependencies, so the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
