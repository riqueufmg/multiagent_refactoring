    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of outgoing dependencies to many metamodel and AST-related classes (e.g. ConditionalExprMetaModel, NameMetaModel, UnaryExprMetaModel, UnionTypeMetaModel, CallableDeclarationMetaModel, SwitchEntryMetaModel, PropertyMetaModel, ArrayTypeMetaModel, PrimitiveTypeMetaModel, etc.), and it is referenced by a wide range of incoming clients across AST nodes, types, statements, expressions, serialization and generator code (e.g. UnionType, ArrayType, PrimitiveType, CompilationUnit, Node, MethodDeclaration, FieldDeclaration, many Expr/Stmt classes, JavaParserJsonSerializer/Deserializer, NodeGenerator, VisitorGenerator, PropertyGenerator, etc.). This combination of extensive incoming and outgoing connections identifies the class as a central hub-like abstraction with high coupling to many other abstractions, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
