    "justification": "CharLiteralExprMetaModel has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies: []). It is referenced by only two incoming classes: com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.CharLiteralExpr and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming count is small (2) and outgoing is zero, so the smell is not detected."
