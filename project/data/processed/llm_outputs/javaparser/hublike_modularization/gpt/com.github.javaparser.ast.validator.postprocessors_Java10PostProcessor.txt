    "justification": "Java10PostProcessor has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions (com.github.javaparser.Processor, com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ClassOrInterfaceType, com.github.javaparser.ParseResult, com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the outgoing set is small (4) and there are no incoming dependencies, so it is not a hub."
