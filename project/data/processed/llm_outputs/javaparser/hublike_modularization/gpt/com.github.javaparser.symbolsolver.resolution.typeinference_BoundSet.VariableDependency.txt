    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet.VariableDependency",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet) and one outgoing dependency (to com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.InferenceVariable). Incoming: BoundSet -> BoundSet.VariableDependency. Outgoing: VariableDependency -> InferenceVariable (which itself depends on ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration and ResolvedType). Since the analyzed class connects to only a single other abstraction in each direction, it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization (which requires many incoming and outgoing dependency relations)."
