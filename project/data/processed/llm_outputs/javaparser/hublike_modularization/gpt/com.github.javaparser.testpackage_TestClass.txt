    "justification": "The class has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (incoming_dependencies = [], outgoing_dependencies = []; analyzed_package.dependencies = []). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; with zero dependencies this class does not meet that criterion."
