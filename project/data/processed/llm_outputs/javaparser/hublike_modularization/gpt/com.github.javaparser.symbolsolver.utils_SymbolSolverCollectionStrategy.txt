    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. SymbolSolverCollectionStrategy has outgoing dependencies to com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.CombinedTypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration, and com.github.javaparser.utils.ProjectRoot (3 outgoing), but there are no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). The lack of incoming relations prevents it from being a hub."
