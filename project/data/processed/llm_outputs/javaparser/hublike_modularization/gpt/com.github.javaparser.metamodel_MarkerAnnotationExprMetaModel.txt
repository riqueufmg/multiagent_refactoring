    "justification": "MarkerAnnotationExprMetaModel has no outgoing dependencies (dependencies: []). It has only two incoming dependents: com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MarkerAnnotationExpr and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel. Although JavaParserMetaModel lists many dependencies (including MarkerAnnotationExprMetaModel), the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships required for Hub-like Modularization. Therefore the smell is not detected."
