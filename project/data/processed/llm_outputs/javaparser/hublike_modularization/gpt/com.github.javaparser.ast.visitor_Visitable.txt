    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.Visitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Visitable has only two outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitor and com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitor) while it has incoming dependencies from seven classes (ModifierVisitor, ObjectIdentityEqualsVisitor, EqualsVisitor, NoCommentEqualsVisitor, CloneVisitor, PrettyPrintVisitor, DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; here the outgoing degree is small (2), so Visitable is not a hub despite having multiple incoming dependents."
