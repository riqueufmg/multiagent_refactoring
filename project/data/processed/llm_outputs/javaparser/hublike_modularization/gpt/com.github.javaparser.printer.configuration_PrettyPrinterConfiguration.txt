    "justification": "PrettyPrinterConfiguration has a small, focused set of outgoing dependencies (4): DefaultPrinterConfiguration, PrinterConfiguration, Indentation, ConfigurationOption. It has a small number of incoming dependents (3): com.github.javaparser.printer.PrettyPrintVisitor, com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter, com.github.javaparser.printer.PrettyPrinter. Both the incoming and outgoing dependencies are limited in number and confined to related printing/configuration abstractions rather than a large number of diverse classes, so it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
