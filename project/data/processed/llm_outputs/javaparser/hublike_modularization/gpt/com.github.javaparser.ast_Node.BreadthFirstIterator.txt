    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Node.BreadthFirstIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (dependencies = [], outgoing_dependencies = [], incoming_dependencies = []). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here incoming count = 0 and outgoing count = 0, so the smell is not present."
