    "justification": "ResolvedTypePatternDeclaration has 0 outgoing dependencies (no outbound edges) and only 1 incoming dependency source (com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedDeclaration). Although ResolvedDeclaration itself references multiple declarations (ResolvedFieldDeclaration, ResolvedParameterDeclaration, ResolvedEnumConstantDeclaration, ResolvedTypeDeclaration, ResolvedMethodDeclaration, ResolvedTypePatternDeclaration), the analyzed class interacts directly with only that single abstraction. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies with numerous distinct abstractions; those conditions are not met here."
