    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of incoming and/or outgoing relationships; those conditions are not met here. Note: the incoming class lists several other dependencies, but that does not make the analyzed class itself a hub."
