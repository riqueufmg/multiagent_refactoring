    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LazyType has a limited set of outgoing dependencies (7 distinct abstractions: ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedTypeVariable, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedType, ResolvedPrimitiveType, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedArrayType) and only 2 incoming dependents are shown (TypeExtractor and ResolvedReferenceType). Although there is a two-way link with ResolvedReferenceType, the overall number of incoming and outgoing connections is not large enough to qualify as a hub-like module under the provided data."
