    "justification": "MethodUsage has many incoming dependencies (26 distinct clients including ReflectionClassDeclaration, JavaParserFacade, SymbolSolver, MethodResolutionLogic, TypeInference, JavassistUtils, Solver, etc.), but only a small set of outgoing dependencies (5 targets: com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.parametrization.ResolvedTypeParametersMap, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedMethodDeclaration). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming is large but outgoing is limited, so the smell is not detected."
