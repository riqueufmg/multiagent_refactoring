    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (referenced by com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.DifferenceElementCalculator) and one outgoing dependency (depends on com.github.javaparser.ast.Node). Both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are low (1 each), so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. Note: com.github.javaparser.ast.Node's many dependencies are not direct dependencies of this class and are not considered here (analysis is class-local)."
