    "justification": "UnparsableStmtMetaModel has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It does have incoming dependencies from com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.UnparsableStmt and from com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel (the latter references a very large set of meta-model classes including UnparsableStmtMetaModel). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming AND many outgoing dependencies; since this class has zero outgoing dependencies, it does not qualify as hub-like."
