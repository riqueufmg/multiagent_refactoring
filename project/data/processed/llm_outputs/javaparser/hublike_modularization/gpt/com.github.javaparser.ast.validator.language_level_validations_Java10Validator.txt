    "justification": "No hub-like modularization: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (to com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator). A hub requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; these counts do not meet that criterion. Note: Validator's own dependencies (ProblemReporter, Node) do not create additional incoming edges to Java10Validator."
