    "justification": "HairType has 3 incoming dependencies (issue1945.main.MainIssue1945, issue1945.interfaces.HairyAnimal, issue1945.interfaces.HairTypeRenderer) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because outgoing dependencies are absent, the smell is not detected when the class is considered in isolation."
