    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.HashCodeVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "HashCodeVisitor has many outgoing dependencies to dozens of AST types and related classes (examples: TraditionalJavadocComment, WildcardType, UnaryExpr, TextBlockLiteralExpr, YieldStmt, ImportDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, CompilationUnit, ClassOrInterfaceType, Node, etc.), but it has only a single incoming dependency shown: com.github.javaparser.ast.Node lists HashCodeVisitor as a dependent. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing is large but incoming is minimal (only Node), so the class is not a hub by the given data."
