    "justification": "Utils has a high incoming degree (33 distinct classes depend on Utils, e.g. PackageDeclaration, VariableDeclarator, PrettyPrintVisitor, LexicalPreservingPrinter, MetaModelGenerator, NodeMetaModelGenerator, PropertyGenerator) but a low outgoing degree (Utils directly depends on only 4 abstractions: com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.Provider, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.UnaryExpr, com.github.javaparser.utils.LineSeparator). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here only the incoming side is large while the outgoing side is small, so the smell is not detected."
