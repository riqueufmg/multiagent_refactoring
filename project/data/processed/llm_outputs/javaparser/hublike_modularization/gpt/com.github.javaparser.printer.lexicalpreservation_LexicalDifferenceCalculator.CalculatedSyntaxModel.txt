    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has incoming dependency from a single class (com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalDifferenceCalculator) only. Because it does not have both many incoming and many outgoing connections to other abstractions, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
