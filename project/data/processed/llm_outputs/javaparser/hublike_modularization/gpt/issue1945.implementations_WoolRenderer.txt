    "justification": "WoolRenderer has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (issue1945.interfaces.HairyAnimal and issue1945.implementations.HairTypeWool) and a single incoming dependency from issue1945.implementations.HairTypeWool. It interacts with only two other abstractions (one of them in a circular relationship), which is not a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies required to classify it as Hub-like Modularization."
