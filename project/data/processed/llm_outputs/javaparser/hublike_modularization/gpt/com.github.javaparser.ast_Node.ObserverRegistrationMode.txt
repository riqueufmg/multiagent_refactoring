    "justification": "The class com.github.javaparser.ast.Node.ObserverRegistrationMode has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependent (com.github.javaparser.ast.Node). Although that incoming class (Node) references many types (24 different dependencies), the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing connections. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion."
