    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.logic.AbstractClassDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []), and only two direct outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedClassDeclaration and com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedReferenceType. Although ResolvedReferenceType itself depends on many types, those are transitive (dependencies of an outgoing dependency), not incoming dependencies of AbstractClassDeclaration. Therefore AbstractClassDeclaration does not exhibit hub-like modularization in isolation."
