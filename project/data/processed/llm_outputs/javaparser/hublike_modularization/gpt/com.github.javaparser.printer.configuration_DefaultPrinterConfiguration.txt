    "justification": "DefaultPrinterConfiguration has 4 outgoing dependencies (DefaultPrinterConfiguration.ConfigOption, ConfigurationOption, PrinterConfiguration, LineSeparator) and 2 incoming dependents (PrettyPrinterConfiguration, MetaModelGenerator). These counts are small and do not indicate an abstraction acting as a hub with many incoming and outgoing relationships, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
