    "justification": "InstantiationSet has a small, bounded set of dependencies: outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.Instantiation) and incoming dependencies from 2 abstractions (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeInference and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet). Although there is a mutual dependency with BoundSet, the total number of distinct incoming and outgoing collaborators is low (5), so it does not exhibit the large-many incoming-and-outgoing interactions characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
