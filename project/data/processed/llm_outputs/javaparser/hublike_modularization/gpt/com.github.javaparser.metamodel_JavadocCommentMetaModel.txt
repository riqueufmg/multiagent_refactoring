    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are empty (no outgoing links). There are only two incoming dependents: com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.JavadocComment and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel. Although JavaParserMetaModel references JavadocCommentMetaModel among many other meta-model classes, the analyzed class itself has no outgoing dependencies and only two incoming connections — not the large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies required to classify it as a hub-like modularization."
