    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions: com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference and com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, and has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
