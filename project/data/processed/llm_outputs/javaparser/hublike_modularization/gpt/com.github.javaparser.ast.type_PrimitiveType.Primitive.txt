    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming dependency entry (from com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Primitive, which lists PrimitiveType.Primitive among its dependencies). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming count = 1 and outgoing count = 0, so it is not a hub."
