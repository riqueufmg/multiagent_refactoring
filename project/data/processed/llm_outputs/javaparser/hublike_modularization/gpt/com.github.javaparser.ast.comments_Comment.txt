    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies: 11 outgoing dependencies (TraditionalJavadocComment, CommentMetaModel, JavadocComment, BlockComment, TokenRange, ObservableProperty, LineComment, JavaParserMetaModel, Node, MarkdownComment, Range) and 16 incoming dependents (including core/system classes such as com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.JavaParser, com.github.javaparser.printer.PrettyPrintVisitor, com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalPreservingPrinter, GeneratedJavaParserTokenManager). Being referenced by central/core abstractions (Node, JavaParser, lexical-preserving printer, token manager) while itself depending on many comment variants, meta-models and node/token range types indicates it functions as a hub with numerous incoming and outgoing connections — matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
