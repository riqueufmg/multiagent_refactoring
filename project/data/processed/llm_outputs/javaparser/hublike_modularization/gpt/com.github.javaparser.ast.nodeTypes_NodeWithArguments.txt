    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NodeWithArguments has only 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.StaticJavaParser, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression, com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; since this class has few direct outgoing dependencies and zero incoming dependencies, it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
