    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 direct outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.ast.AccessSpecifier, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.RecordDeclaration, and com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming links and has a small number of outgoing links, so it is not a hub."
