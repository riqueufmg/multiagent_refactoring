    "justification": "MainIssue1945 has outgoing dependencies to three abstractions (issue1945.interfaces.HairyAnimal, issue1945.interfaces.HairTypeRenderer, issue1945.interfaces.HairType) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and outgoing dependencies; since there are no incoming dependencies, the smell is not detected."
