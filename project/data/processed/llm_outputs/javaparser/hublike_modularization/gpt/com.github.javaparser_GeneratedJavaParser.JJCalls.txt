    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 1 (com.github.javaparser.Token). Incoming dependencies: 1 (from com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParser). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only a single incoming and a single outgoing dependency for JJCalls, so it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
