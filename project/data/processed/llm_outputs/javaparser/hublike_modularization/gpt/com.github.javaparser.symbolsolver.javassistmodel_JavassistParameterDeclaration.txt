    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the class to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. JavassistParameterDeclaration has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistFactory. Because there are no incoming links and the number of direct outgoing dependencies is small and limited to these specific abstractions, it does not meet the criteria for a hub."
