    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization not detected because the class has outgoing dependencies to 5 other abstractions (BaseNodeMetaModel, BlockStmt, CompilationUnit, MethodDeclaration, SourceRoot) but has 0 incoming dependencies. The smell requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming dependency set is empty, so the hub condition is not met."
