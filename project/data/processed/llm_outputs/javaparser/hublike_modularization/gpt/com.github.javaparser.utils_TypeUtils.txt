    "justification": "Type com.github.javaparser.utils.TypeUtils has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (from com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionMethodDeclaration and com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedPrimitiveType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class lacks outgoing connections and has a small number of incoming connections, so it is not a hub."
