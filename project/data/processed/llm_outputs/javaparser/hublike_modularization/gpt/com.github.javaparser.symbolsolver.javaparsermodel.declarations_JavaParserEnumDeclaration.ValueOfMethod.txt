    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: incoming_dependencies is empty (no classes depend on this class). Outgoing dependencies are limited to 3 distinct abstractions: com.github.javaparser.ast.AccessSpecifier, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserEnumDeclaration. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class has zero incoming and only three outgoing, so it does not meet the smell criteria."
