    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 4 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.AccessSpecifier, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.RecordDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.Parameter). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; since incoming is absent and outgoing is small, this is not a hub."
