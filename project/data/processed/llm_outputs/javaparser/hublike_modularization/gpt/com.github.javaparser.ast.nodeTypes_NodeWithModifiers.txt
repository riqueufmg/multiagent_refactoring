    "justification": "NodeWithModifiers has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 3 outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.ast.AccessSpecifier, com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList, and com.github.javaparser.ast.Modifier. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming links are absent and outgoing links are few. Although some of the outgoing targets themselves have multiple dependencies, by the provided data and the requirement to consider the class in isolation, NodeWithModifiers does not meet the hub-like criteria."
