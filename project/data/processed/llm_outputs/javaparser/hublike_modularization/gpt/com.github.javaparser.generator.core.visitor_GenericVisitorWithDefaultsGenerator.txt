    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only outgoing dependencies to five distinct abstractions (BaseNodeMetaModel, BlockStmt, CompilationUnit, MethodDeclaration, SourceRoot). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming couplings and does not show a large number of outgoing couplings."
