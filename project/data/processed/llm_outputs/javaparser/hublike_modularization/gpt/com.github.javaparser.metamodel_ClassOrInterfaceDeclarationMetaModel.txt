    "justification": "Although ClassOrInterfaceDeclarationMetaModel has multiple incoming references (notably com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel, which lists ClassOrInterfaceDeclarationMetaModel among a very large set of meta-models, and com.github.javaparser.ast.body.ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration which depends on it), its direct outgoing dependencies are minimal: only com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel is listed as an outgoing dependency. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming side is large but the outgoing side is not, so the smell is not detected."
