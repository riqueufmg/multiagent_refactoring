    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SuperExprMetaModel has a single outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and only two incoming dependencies in the provided data (com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.SuperExpr and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). This yields three distinct adjacency links in total. A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the observed number of connections is small, so the smell is not present."
