    "justification": "Hub-like modularization not detected: the class has 4 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeParametrizable, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedReferenceType) and 0 incoming dependencies. A hub requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing links; here incoming dependencies are absent and the outgoing count is small. Even though some outgoing targets themselves depend on many types, the analysis must consider the class in isolation, so it is not a hub."
