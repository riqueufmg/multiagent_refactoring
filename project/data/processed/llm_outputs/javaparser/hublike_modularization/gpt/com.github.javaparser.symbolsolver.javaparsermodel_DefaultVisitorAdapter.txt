    "justification": "The class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (106 distinct external classes in the provided list, e.g. com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.UnaryExpr, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ClassOrInterfaceType), but zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many dependencies in both directions (many incoming and many outgoing). Because there are no incoming dependencies in the provided data, the hub-like modularization smell is not detected."
