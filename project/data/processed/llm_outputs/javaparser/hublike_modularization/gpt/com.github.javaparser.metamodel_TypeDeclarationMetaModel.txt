    "justification": "TypeDeclarationMetaModel has a single outgoing dependency: com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel, and only two incoming dependents: com.github.javaparser.ast.body.TypeDeclaration and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows few incoming classes and only one outgoing class (even though JavaParserMetaModel references many meta-models, it is a single incoming dependent), so this class does not meet the criterion for a hub."
