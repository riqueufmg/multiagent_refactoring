    "class": "com.github.javaparser.serialization.JavaParserJsonSerializer.JsonRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (analyzed_package.dependencies = [] and outgoing_dependencies = []). It has a single incoming dependency entry (from com.github.javaparser.serialization.JavaParserJsonSerializer). Although that incoming class depends on many abstractions, JsonRange itself is depended on by only one other abstraction and does not depend on others. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; JsonRange does not meet this (incoming count = 1, outgoing count = 0)."
