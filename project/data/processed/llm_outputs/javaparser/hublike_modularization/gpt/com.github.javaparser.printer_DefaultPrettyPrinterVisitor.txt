    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor has a large number of outgoing dependencies (117 distinct outgoing dependencies, e.g. com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression, com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter, com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.PrinterConfiguration, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration), but it has 0 incoming dependencies in the provided data. Because the incoming dependency count is zero, the condition of having both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies is not met, so the smell is not detected."
