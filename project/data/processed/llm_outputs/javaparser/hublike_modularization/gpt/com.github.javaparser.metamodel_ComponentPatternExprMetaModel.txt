    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ComponentPatternExprMetaModel has no outgoing dependencies (dependencies: []). It has only two incoming references recorded: com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ComponentPatternExpr and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel. Although JavaParserMetaModel itself references many meta-model classes, ComponentPatternExprMetaModel is referenced by only these two classes and does not depend on many others. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks that pattern (no outgoing deps and only minimal incoming refs), so it is not a hub."
