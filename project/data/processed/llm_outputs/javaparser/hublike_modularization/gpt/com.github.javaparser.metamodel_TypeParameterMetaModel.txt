    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires the class to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. In the provided data, TypeParameterMetaModel has a single outgoing dependency: com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel. It has incoming references from two classes: com.github.javaparser.ast.type.TypeParameter and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel. The counts of incoming (2) and outgoing (1) dependencies are low and do not constitute a hub connecting a large number of other abstractions, so the smell is not detected."
