    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.JavaSymbolSolver) and 1 outgoing dependency (to com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedPrimitiveType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and many outgoing); these counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
