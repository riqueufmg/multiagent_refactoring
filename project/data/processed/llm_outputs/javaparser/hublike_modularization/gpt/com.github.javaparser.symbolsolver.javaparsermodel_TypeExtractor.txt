    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeExtractor has a large number of outgoing dependencies (68 distinct referenced abstractions including com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, etc.), but it has only a single incoming dependency recorded (only com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade depends on TypeExtractor). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires the abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; here outgoing fan-out is high while incoming fan-in is minimal, so the smell is not detected when the class is considered in isolation."
