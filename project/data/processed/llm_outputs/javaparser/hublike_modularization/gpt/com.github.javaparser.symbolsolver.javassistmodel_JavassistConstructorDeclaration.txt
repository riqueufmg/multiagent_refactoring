    "justification": "JavassistConstructorDeclaration has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions (AccessSpecifier; ResolvedParameterDeclaration; JavassistMethodLikeDeclarationAdapter; ResolvedType; TypeSolver; JavassistFactory; ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration) but has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies means this class is not a hub."
