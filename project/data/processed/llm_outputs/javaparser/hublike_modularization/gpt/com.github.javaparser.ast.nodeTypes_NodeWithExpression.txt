    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NodeWithExpression has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []), and only two direct outgoing dependencies (StaticJavaParser and Expression). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. Although the two depended-on classes (StaticJavaParser and Expression) themselves reference many other types, NodeWithExpression itself does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
