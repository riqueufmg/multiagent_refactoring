    "justification": "The analyzed class javaparser.GenericClass.NestedBar has 0 incoming dependencies and 0 outgoing dependencies (incoming_dependencies and outgoing_dependencies arrays are empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; since both counts are zero, this smell is not present."
