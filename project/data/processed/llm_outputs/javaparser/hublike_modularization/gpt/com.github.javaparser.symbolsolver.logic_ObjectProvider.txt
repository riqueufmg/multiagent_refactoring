    "justification": "ObjectProvider has only one direct outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedReferenceType) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here there are not multiple direct dependents or dependencies, so the smell is not detected. (The listed dependencies of ResolvedReferenceType are second-level and do not count as direct dependencies of ObjectProvider.)"
