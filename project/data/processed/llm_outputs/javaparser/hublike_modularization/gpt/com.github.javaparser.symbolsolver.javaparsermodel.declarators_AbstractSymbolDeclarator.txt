    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (to com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver). Although that outgoing target depends on 3 other abstractions, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies required for Hub-like Modularization."
