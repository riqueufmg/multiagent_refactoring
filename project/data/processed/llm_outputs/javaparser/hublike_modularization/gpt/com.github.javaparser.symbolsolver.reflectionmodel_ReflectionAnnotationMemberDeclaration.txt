    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The provided data shows 6 outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression, com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedPrimitiveType, and 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies (incoming count = 0), the class does not meet the definition of a hub (which requires many incoming and outgoing connections)."
