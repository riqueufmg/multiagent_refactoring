    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.serialization.JavaParserJsonSerializer). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships with other abstractions. Here the analyzed class lacks outgoing links and has a single incoming link, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
