    "justification": "CsmToken has many outgoing and incoming ties: outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions (com.github.javaparser.TokenTypes, com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserConstants, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.utils.LineSeparator, com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter, com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElement) and is referenced by 5 distinct classes (com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Kept, DifferenceElementCalculator, LexicalPreservingPrinter, Removed, RemovedGroup). These connections span multiple packages (core parser types, AST, printer, lexicalpreservation) and include shared/common types (e.g., TokenTypes, Node, LineSeparator) between CsmToken and its clients, indicating the class functions as a central hub linking many abstractions. The breadth of both incoming and outgoing dependencies meets the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
