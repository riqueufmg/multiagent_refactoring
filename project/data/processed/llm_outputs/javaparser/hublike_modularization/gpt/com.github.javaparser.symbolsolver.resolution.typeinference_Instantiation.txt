    "justification": "Instantiation has only 2 outgoing dependencies (InferenceVariable, ResolvedType) and is directly referenced by 2 incoming classes (BoundSet, InstantiationSet). A hub-like module would have many incoming and outgoing dependency edges to many other abstractions; the provided data shows only a small number of direct connections. (Note: BoundSet itself has many dependencies, but those are not direct dependencies of Instantiation in the provided data.)"
