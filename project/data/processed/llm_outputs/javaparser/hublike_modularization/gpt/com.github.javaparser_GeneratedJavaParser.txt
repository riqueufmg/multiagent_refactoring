    "justification": "Although GeneratedJavaParser has a very large number of outgoing dependencies (the outgoing_dependencies list includes dozens of distinct AST node, expression, statement, type and utility classes such as com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.IfStmt, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MethodCallExpr, com.github.javaparser.TokenRange, com.github.javaparser.JavaToken, com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserTokenManager, com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression, com.github.javaparser.utils.Pair, etc.), it has very few incoming dependencies in the provided data. Only two classes are shown as depending on it (com.github.javaparser.JavaParser and com.github.javaparser.ParseStart). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing side is large but the incoming side is small, so the smell is not detected."
