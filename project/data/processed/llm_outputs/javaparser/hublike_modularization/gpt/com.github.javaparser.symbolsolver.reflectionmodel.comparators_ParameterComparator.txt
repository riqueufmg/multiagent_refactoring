    "justification": "ParameterComparator has 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.comparators.ClassComparator) and 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.comparators.MethodComparator). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are minimal (1 each), so the smell is not present."
