    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DoStatementContext has 0 incoming dependencies and 6 outgoing direct dependencies (PatternVariableResult, TypeSolver, Expression, PatternVariableVisitor, NormalCompletionVisitor, DoStmt). Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and only has a small set of outgoing dependencies. Transitive/deeper dependency lists of the outgoing targets are not counted when analyzing the class in isolation."
