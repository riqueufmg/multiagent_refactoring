    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are minimal: only com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel (1 outgoing). Incoming dependencies are limited to two distinct classes: com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ArrayCreationExpr and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel (2 incoming). Although JavaParserMetaModel itself lists many meta-models, that represents a single incoming dependency from JavaParserMetaModel to ArrayCreationExprMetaModel, not many independent incoming connections. Because the analyzed class has only 1 outgoing and 2 incoming dependencies (not a large number on both sides), it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
