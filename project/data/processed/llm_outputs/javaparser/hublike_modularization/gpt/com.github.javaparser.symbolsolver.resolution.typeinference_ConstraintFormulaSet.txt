    "justification": "ConstraintFormulaSet has a small number of relationships: 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ConstraintFormula, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet) and 2 incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeInference, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the observed in-degree and out-degree here are low. Although BoundSet appears both as incoming and outgoing (reciprocal dependency), the overall coupling cardinality is not large enough to qualify as a hub."
