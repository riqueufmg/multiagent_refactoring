    "justification": "YamlPrinter has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and 3 direct outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList, com.github.javaparser.metamodel.NodeMetaModel, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although one outgoing target (com.github.javaparser.ast.Node) itself lists many dependencies (e.g., PrinterConfiguration, Range, Comment, TokenRange, visitors, metamodel classes, etc.), the analyzed class lacks incoming links and has only three direct outgoing links, so it does not qualify as a hub."
