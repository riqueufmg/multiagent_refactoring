    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 10 distinct abstractions (Context, MethodUsage, SymbolReference, ReflectionMethodResolutionLogic, ResolvedType, TypeSolver, ReflectionFactory, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ReflectionClassAdapter, InferenceContext) — showing moderate outward connectivity. Incoming dependencies: only 1 abstraction (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.SymbolSolver) depends on this class. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming coupling is minimal while outgoing is the primary contributor. Therefore this class does not qualify as a hub (many incoming and outgoing) based on the provided data."
