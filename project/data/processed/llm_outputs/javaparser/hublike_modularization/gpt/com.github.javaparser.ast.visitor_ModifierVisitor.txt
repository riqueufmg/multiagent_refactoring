    "justification": "ModifierVisitor has a large number of outgoing dependencies (e.g., com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression, com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.Statement, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit and many other AST node types and comment types) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because incoming dependencies are absent, this class is not exhibiting Hub-like Modularization."
