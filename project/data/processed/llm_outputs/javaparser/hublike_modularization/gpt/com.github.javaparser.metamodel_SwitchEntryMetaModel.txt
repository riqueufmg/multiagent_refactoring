    "justification": "SwitchEntryMetaModel has a small number of dependencies: only one outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependents (com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.SwitchEntry and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Hub-like Modularization is characterized by an abstraction having incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low incoming and outgoing counts, so the smell is not detected."
