    "class": "com.example.Alpha.CustomInterface",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 0 outgoing dependencies (incoming_dependencies: [], outgoing_dependencies: []). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class has none, so the smell is not detected."
