    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (to com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion (no incoming dependencies and only a single outgoing dependency)."
