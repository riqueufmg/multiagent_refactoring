    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (17 distinct abstractions) spanning core resolution and AST components (examples: com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade, com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.MethodResolutionLogic, com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.ConstructorResolutionLogic, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, and multiple AST node types). At the same time it has multiple incoming dependencies (4 different context classes depend on it: EnumDeclarationContext, ClassOrInterfaceDeclarationContext, AnnotationDeclarationContext, RecordDeclarationContext). Because it both depends on many core abstractions across several responsibility areas and is referenced by multiple other contexts, it functions as a central hub linking many modules and therefore exhibits Hub-like Modularization."
