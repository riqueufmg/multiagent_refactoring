    "justification": "MethodDeclarationMetaModel has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and only 2 incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Although JavaParserMetaModel references many meta-model classes and PropertyMetaModel has its own dependencies, MethodDeclarationMetaModel itself does not have a large number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships required to qualify as a hub."
