    "justification": "ResolvedUnionType has a small set of relationships: 2 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType) and 2 incoming dependents (com.github.javaparser.ast.type.UnionType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). Because both incoming and outgoing adjacency are limited (only two distinct other abstractions each), it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization, which requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions."
