    "class": "javaparser.GenericClass.Foo",

    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from javaparser.GenericClass). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; these counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
