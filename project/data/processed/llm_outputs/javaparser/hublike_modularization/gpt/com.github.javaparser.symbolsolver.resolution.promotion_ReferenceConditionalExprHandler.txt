    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ReferenceConditionalExprHandler has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeHelper and com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although the outgoing TypeHelper and ResolvedType types themselves reference many classes, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
