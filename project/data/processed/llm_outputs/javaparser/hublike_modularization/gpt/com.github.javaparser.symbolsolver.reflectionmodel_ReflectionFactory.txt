    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ReflectionFactory has a large number of outgoing dependencies (11 distinct types: e.g. AccessSpecifier, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedType, AbstractTypeDeclaration, ReflectionTypeParameter, TypeSolver, ResolvedPrimitiveType, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ResolvedVoidType, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedReferenceType) and many incoming dependents (15 distinct classes reference it: e.g. ReflectionMethodDeclaration, ReflectionClassDeclaration, ReflectionAnnotationDeclaration, ReflectionParameterDeclaration, ReflectionEnumDeclaration, ReflectionRecordDeclaration, ReflectionTypeParameter, ReflectionClassAdapter, ReflectionInterfaceDeclaration, ReflectionConstructorDeclaration, ReflectionFieldDeclaration, JavaParserEnumDeclaration, ClassLoaderTypeSolver, ReflectionTypeSolver, ReflectionPatternDeclaration). These connections span multiple packages (symbolsolver.reflectionmodel, resolution.types, resolution.declarations, javaparsermodel, resolution.typesolvers, etc.), indicating the class both depends on and is depended upon by a large number of other abstractions. This pattern matches the Hub-like Modularization smell."
