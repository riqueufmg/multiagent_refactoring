    "detection": true,
    "justification": "TypeHelper has a large number of both outgoing and incoming dependencies. Outgoing: TypeHelper depends on at least 15 distinct abstractions (examples: ResolvedType, TypeSolver, Expression, LambdaExpr, JavaParserFacade, MethodType, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedPrimitiveType, ReferenceTypeImpl, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, FunctionalInterfaceLogic, LeastUpperBoundLogic, Pair, SymbolReference). Incoming: at least 10 distinct abstractions depend on TypeHelper (examples: BoundSet, LeastUpperBoundLogic, TypeContainedByType, ExpressionCompatibleWithType, TypeCompatibleWithType, TypeSubtypeOfType, TypeSameAsType, SubtypeOfBound, SameAsBound, ReferenceConditionalExprHandler). The presence of many callers from diverse type-inference constraint and bounds classes plus many core type/system dependencies indicates TypeHelper acts as a central hub, satisfying the Hub-like Modularization smell."
