    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ArrayType.Origin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ArrayType.Origin has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ArrayType). The incoming class's dependency list contains 18 entries (e.g. com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitor, com.github.javaparser.utils.Pair, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ArrayType.Origin, ...), but the analyzed class itself is referenced by a single other abstraction and does not depend on other abstractions. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing relationships; this class has neither, so the smell is not present."
