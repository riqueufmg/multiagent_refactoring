    "justification": "NodeWithJavadoc has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only four outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.javadoc.Javadoc, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.Comment, com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.JavadocComment). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships. Given 0 incoming and only 4 outgoing, this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
