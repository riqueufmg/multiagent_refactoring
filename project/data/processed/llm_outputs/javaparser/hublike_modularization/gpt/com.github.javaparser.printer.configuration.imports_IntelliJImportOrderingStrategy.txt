    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only one outgoing dependency: com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although NodeList itself depends on several types (com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitor, com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitor, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.AstObserver, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node), those are indirect; considering the class in isolation, it does not exhibit hub-like dependency characteristics."
