    "justification": "The analyzed class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []) and only a single incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Difference). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming count = 1 and outgoing count = 0, so this class is not a hub."
