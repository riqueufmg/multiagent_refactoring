    "justification": "ReflectionTypeSolver has a small number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships: incoming from 2 classes (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.TypeSolverBuilder, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.constraintformulas.TypeCompatibleWithType) and outgoing to 2 classes (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils.ModuleLayerHelper, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionFactory). There is no evidence in the provided data of many distinct incoming or outgoing abstractions directly coupled to ReflectionTypeSolver (the many types listed are dependencies of ReflectionFactory, not direct dependencies of ReflectionTypeSolver). Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
