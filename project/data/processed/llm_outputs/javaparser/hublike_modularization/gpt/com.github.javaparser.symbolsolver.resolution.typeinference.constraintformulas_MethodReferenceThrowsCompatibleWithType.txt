    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MethodReferenceExpr, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming_count=0 and outgoing_count=3, so it is not a hub. While the outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, that does not make the analyzed class a hub in isolation."
