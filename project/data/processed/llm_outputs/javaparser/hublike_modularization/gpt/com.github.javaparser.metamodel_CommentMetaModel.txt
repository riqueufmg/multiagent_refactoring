    "justification": "CommentMetaModel has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and only 2 incoming dependencies listed (com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.Comment and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). The definition of Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only a small number of incoming/outgoing relationships, so the smell is not detected."
