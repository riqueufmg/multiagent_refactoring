    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.DifferenceElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DifferenceElement has multiple incoming dependencies (5 distinct classes depend on it: LexicalDifferenceCalculator, Difference, ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor, Reshuffled, Added) but only a small number of outgoing dependencies (2 distinct abstractions referenced: LexicalDifferenceCalculator, CsmElement). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing. The provided data shows high incoming fan-in but low outgoing fan-out, so it does not meet the symmetric 'hub-like' criterion."
