    "justification": "LineCommentMetaModel has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only two incoming dependencies: com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.LineComment and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; LineCommentMetaModel does not meet that criterion."
