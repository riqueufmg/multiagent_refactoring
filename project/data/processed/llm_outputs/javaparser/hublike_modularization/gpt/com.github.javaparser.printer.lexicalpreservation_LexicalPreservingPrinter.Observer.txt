    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. This class has outgoing dependencies to 4 classes: com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.AstObserver, com.github.javaparser.JavaToken, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty, and com.github.javaparser.utils.LineSeparator, and has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Because it lacks incoming dependencies and the outgoing count is not large, the hub-like modularization smell is not detected."
