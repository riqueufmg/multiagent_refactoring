    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to (default package).C and (default package).ConstantA (2 outgoing), but the incoming_dependencies list is empty (0 incoming). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class lacks incoming links and has only two outgoing links, so it does not qualify as a hub."
