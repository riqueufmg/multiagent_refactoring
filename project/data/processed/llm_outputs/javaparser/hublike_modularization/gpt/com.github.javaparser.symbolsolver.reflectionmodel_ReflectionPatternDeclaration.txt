    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionFactory, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; neither condition is met here, so the smell is not detected."
