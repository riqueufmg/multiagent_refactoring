    "justification": "MethodReferenceExpr participates in many incoming and outgoing relationships: outgoing dependencies include core AST and support abstractions (Expression, Node, NodeList, TokenRange, Range, JavaParserMetaModel, MethodReferenceExprMetaModel, ObservableProperty, ResolvedMethodDeclaration, Utils), showing it depends on multiple subsystems. It is referenced by a large and diverse set of incoming classes across visitors, symbol resolution, parsing and printing (for example: many ast.visitor classes such as VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, EqualsVisitor, HashCodeVisitor, ModifierVisitor, CloneVisitor, VoidVisitorAdapter, GenericVisitorAdapter, PrettyPrintVisitor, DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor, NodeFinderVisitor; parser/runtime classes such as GeneratedJavaParser; and symbol-solver classes such as JavaParserFacade, TypeExtractor, TypeInference, MethodReferenceExprContext, MethodReferenceThrowsCompatibleWithType, DefaultVisitorAdapter). The multiplicity and diversity of both incoming (numerous visitors, symbol-solver, parser and printer clients) and outgoing dependencies indicate MethodReferenceExpr acts as a hub linking many abstractions, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
