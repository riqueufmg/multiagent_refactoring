    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorSet",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "VisitorSet has only one direct outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitor) and one incoming dependency (com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorSet.EqualsHashcodeOverridingFacade). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Considering the class in isolation, VisitorSet's direct fan-in and fan-out are both low (1 each). Although GenericVisitor itself references many AST types, those are transitive from VisitorSet and do not increase VisitorSet's direct number of dependencies under the provided data, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
