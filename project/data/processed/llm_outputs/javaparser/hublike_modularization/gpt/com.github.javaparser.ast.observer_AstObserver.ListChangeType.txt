    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.AstObserver). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and outgoing dependencies with numerous other abstractions; here the dependency counts are minimal, so the smell is not present."
