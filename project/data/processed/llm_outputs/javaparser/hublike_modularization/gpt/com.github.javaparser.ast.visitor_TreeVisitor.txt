    "justification": "TreeVisitor has 0 incoming dependencies and only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.Node). Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction itself to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. While the single outgoing target (Node) has many dependencies, the analysis must consider TreeVisitor in isolation, so it does not qualify as a hub."
