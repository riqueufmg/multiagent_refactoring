    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavaParserAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JavaParserAdapter has many outgoing dependencies (25 distinct types listed, e.g. ParserConfiguration, JavaParser, CompilationUnit, ParseResult, numerous AST node types such as Name, MethodDeclaration, Type, BlockStmt), but very few incoming dependencies (only 1 incoming: com.github.javaparser.StaticJavaParser). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions (many incoming and many outgoing). Because incoming dependency count is minimal while outgoing is large, this class does not meet the bidirectional 'hub' criterion."
