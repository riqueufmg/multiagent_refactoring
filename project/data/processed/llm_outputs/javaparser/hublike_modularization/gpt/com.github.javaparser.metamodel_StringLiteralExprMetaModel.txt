    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (from com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.StringLiteralExpr and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not exhibit a large number in either direction."
