    "detection": true,
    "justification": "ResolvedType has a very large number of incoming dependencies (132 distinct classes in the provided data) from many packages and subsystems (examples: com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.JavaSymbolSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionClassDeclaration, numerous symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference classes, many AST node types such as MethodCallExpr/Expression/Type, and many resolution/model types). It also has multiple outgoing dependencies (9 distinct types listed: ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedTypeVariable, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, Context, ResolvedPrimitiveType, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedUnionType, ResolvedLambdaConstraintType, ResolvedArrayType). The combination of very high incoming coupling (many clients) and several outgoing dependencies indicates ResolvedType acts as a central/hub abstraction connecting a large number of other abstractions, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
