    "justification": "NumericConditionalExprHandler has only two outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedPrimitiveType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType) and zero incoming dependencies. Although ResolvedType itself depends on many other abstractions, the analyzed class does not exhibit both widespread incoming and outgoing connections required for Hub-like Modularization."
