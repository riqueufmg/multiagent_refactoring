    "justification": "ResolvedDeclaration has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions: com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedFieldDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedParameterDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedEnumConstantDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedMethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypePatternDeclaration. It has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; because incoming dependencies are absent (0), ResolvedDeclaration does not qualify as a hub. (Note: some of its outgoing targets themselves depend on additional types, e.g., ResolvedTypeDeclaration depends on several declarations and ResolvedMethodDeclaration depends on ResolvedType, but those do not create incoming edges to ResolvedDeclaration.)"
