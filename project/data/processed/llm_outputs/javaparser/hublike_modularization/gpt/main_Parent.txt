    "justification": "The class main.Parent has 0 incoming dependencies and 0 outgoing dependencies (incoming_dependencies and outgoing_dependencies are empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; since both counts are zero, this class does not exhibit the smell."
