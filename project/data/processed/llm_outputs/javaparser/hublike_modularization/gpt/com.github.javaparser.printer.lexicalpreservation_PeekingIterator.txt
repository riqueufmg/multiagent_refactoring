    "justification": "PeekingIterator is not a hub: it has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; PeekingIterator does not meet this (incoming count = 1, outgoing count = 0)."
