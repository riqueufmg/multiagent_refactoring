    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies and no outgoing dependencies (incoming_dependencies = [], outgoing_dependencies = []). Since Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions, this class does not exhibit the smell."
