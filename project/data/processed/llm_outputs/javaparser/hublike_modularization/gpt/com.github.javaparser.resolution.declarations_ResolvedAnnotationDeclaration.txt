    "justification": "ResolvedAnnotationDeclaration has 0 outgoing dependencies (no listed outgoing_dependencies) but has multiple incoming dependencies (5): com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.JavaSymbolSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.AnnotationDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.AnnotationExpr, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeDeclaration. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; since this class has no outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the criterion for a hub."
