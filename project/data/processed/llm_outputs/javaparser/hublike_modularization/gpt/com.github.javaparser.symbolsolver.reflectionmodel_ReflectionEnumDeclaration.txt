    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ReflectionEnumDeclaration has a relatively large number of outgoing dependencies (15 distinct target abstractions, e.g. ResolvedEnumConstantDeclaration, TypeSolver, SymbolReference, ResolvedType, ReflectionMethodResolutionLogic, ReflectionFactory, ReflectionClassAdapter, MethodUsage, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, InferenceContext, etc.) but only 2 incoming dependencies (ReflectionEnumConstantDeclaration and SymbolSolver). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the incoming degree is small, so this class does not meet the definition of a hub in isolation."
