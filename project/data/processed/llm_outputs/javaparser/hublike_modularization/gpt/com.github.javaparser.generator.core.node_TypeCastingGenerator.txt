    "justification": "TypeCastingGenerator has multiple outgoing dependencies (StaticJavaParser, BaseNodeMetaModel, CompilationUnit, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, JavaParserMetaModel, Pair, SourceRoot) but has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies prevents this class from being a hub."
