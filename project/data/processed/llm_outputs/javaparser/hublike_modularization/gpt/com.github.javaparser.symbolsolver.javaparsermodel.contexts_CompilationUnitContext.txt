    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. CompilationUnitContext has 12 outgoing dependencies (SymbolReference, Name, JavaParserFacade, MethodDeclaration, TypeSolver, SymbolSolver, ResolvedTypeDeclaration, Node, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, CompilationUnit, ClassOrInterfaceType, MethodResolutionLogic) but zero incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies in the provided data, the class does not meet the 'both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions' criterion and therefore is not a hub."
