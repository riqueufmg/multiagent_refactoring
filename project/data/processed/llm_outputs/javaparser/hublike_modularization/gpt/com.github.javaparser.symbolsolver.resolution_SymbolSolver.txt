    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.SymbolSolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "SymbolSolver has many outgoing dependencies (16 distinct abstractions: TypeSolver, ReflectionEnumDeclaration, ResolvedTypeDeclaration, SymbolReference, ResolvedType, ast.Type, Context, ReflectionClassDeclaration, Node, ReflectionInterfaceDeclaration, MethodUsage, ReflectionAnnotationDeclaration, ResolvedPrimitiveType, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, JavaParserFactory, etc.), and multiple incoming clients depend on it (at least 4 identified: JavaParserFacade, TypeExtractor, JavaParserEnumDeclaration, CompilationUnitContext). The class therefore both uses and is used by a large number of other abstractions across solver, reflection-model, AST types, resolved-types and factory/context components, matching the hub-like modularization smell (central coordinator with many incoming and outgoing links)."
