    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.LiteralExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LiteralExprMetaModel has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has only two incoming dependencies: com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.LiteralExpr and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel. A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing ties. Here incoming count is small (2) and outgoing count is zero, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria. Note: JavaParserMetaModel depends on many meta-model classes (including LiteralExprMetaModel), but that makes JavaParserMetaModel highly connected rather than making LiteralExprMetaModel a hub."
