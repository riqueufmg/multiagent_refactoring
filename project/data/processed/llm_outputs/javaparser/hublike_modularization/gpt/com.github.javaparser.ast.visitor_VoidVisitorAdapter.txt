    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. VoidVisitorAdapter has a large number of outgoing dependencies (107 distinct dependent classes listed) but has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Because the incoming dependency count is zero, the criterion of having large dependencies in both directions is not met, so this is not detected as Hub-like Modularization."
