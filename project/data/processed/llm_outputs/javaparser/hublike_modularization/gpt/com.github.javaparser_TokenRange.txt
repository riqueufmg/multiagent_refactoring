    "justification": "TokenRange has very high fan-in (referenced by 127 different classes in the provided data — examples include com.github.javaparser.JavaToken, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression, com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.Statement, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Type, com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, etc.). However, its fan-out is minimal: it only depends on one abstraction (com.github.javaparser.JavaToken). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions (many incoming and many outgoing). Because TokenRange's outgoing dependencies are not large, the hub-like modularization smell is not detected."
