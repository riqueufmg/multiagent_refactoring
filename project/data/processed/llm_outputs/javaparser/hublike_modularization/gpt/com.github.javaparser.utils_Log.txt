    "justification": "Log has only 2 incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot, com.github.javaparser.generator.core.CoreGenerator) and 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.utils.Log.Adapter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows small counts, so Log is not a hub."
