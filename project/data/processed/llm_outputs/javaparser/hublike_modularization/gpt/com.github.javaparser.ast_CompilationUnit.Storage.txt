    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit.Storage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a very small set of dependencies: incoming dependencies from 1 abstraction (com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit) and outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit and com.github.javaparser.ParseStart). Total distinct connected abstractions = 2. Although there is a bidirectional relationship with com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, the number of incoming and outgoing links is not large, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
