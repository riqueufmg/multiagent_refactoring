    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only one outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and only two incoming dependents (com.github.javaparser.ast.body.CallableDeclaration and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Although JavaParserMetaModel references many meta-models, that counts as a single incoming dependency to CallableDeclarationMetaModel. There is not a large number of distinct incoming and outgoing dependencies required for Hub-like Modularization."
