    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorSet) and 0 incoming dependencies. The low counts (1 outgoing, 0 incoming) do not meet the 'hub-like' criteria, so the smell is not detected."
