    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 3 distinct abstractions (com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.LambdaExpr) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies means this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
