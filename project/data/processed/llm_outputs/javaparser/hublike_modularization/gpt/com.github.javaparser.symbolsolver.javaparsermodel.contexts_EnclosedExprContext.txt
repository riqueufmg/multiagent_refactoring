    "justification": "EnclosedExprContext has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.EnclosedExpr, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; here the incoming degree is zero and the outgoing degree is minimal, so the smell is not present."
