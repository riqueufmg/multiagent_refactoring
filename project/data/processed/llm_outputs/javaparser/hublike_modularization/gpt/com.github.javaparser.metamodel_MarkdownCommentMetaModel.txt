    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.MarkdownCommentMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []), so it does not have many outgoing links. It only has two incoming dependents (com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.MarkdownComment and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Although JavaParserMetaModel references many meta-model types (including MarkdownCommentMetaModel), the analyzed class itself does not depend on a large number of other abstractions. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class lacks the outgoing side, so the smell is not detected."
