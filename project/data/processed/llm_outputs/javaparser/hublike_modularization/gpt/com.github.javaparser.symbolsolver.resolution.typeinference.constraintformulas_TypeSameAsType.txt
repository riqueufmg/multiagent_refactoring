    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeSameAsType has only 3 outgoing dependencies (TypeHelper, BoundSet, ResolvedType) and a single incoming dependency (BoundSet). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows small, limited coupling, so this class is not a hub."
