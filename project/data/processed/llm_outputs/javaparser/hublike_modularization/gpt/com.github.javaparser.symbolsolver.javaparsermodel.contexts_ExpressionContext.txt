    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing is small. (Note: TypeSolver itself depends on three classes, but those are not additional direct incoming dependencies to ExpressionContext.)"
