    "detection": false,
    "justification": "VarValidator has only outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (ProblemReporter, VariableDeclarationExpr, VarType) and has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; VarValidator lacks incoming edges and only references three classes, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria. Note: the detailed dependency lists of the three outgoing classes do not create incoming dependencies to VarValidator and therefore do not make it a hub."
