    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ImportOrderingStrategy has only one direct outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList) and only one incoming dependent class (com.github.javaparser.printer.DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor). Although the incoming class and the outgoing NodeList themselves reference many other types, ImportOrderingStrategy itself does not have a large number of distinct incoming and outgoing dependencies, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
