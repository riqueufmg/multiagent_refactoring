    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.VoidTypeMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "VoidTypeMetaModel has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (from com.github.javaparser.ast.type.VoidType and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). The JavaParserMetaModel entry shows many outgoing dependencies from that class, but those are not outgoing dependencies of VoidTypeMetaModel. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; VoidTypeMetaModel lacks outgoing links and does not exhibit a large number of incoming links, so the smell is not detected."
