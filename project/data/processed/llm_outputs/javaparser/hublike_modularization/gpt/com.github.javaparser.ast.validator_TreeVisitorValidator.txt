    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.TreeVisitorValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TreeVisitorValidator has 0 incoming dependencies (no classes depend on it) and only 3 outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.ProblemReporter, com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator, and com.github.javaparser.ast.Node. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; the provided data shows neither many incoming nor many outgoing relationships for this class, so the smell is not present."
