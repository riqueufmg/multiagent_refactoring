    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeCompatibleWithType has multiple outgoing dependencies (ResolvedType, TypeSolver, ReflectionTypeSolver, ReferenceTypeImpl, BoundSet, TypeHelper) but has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; because incoming_dependencies is empty, the class does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell in isolation."
