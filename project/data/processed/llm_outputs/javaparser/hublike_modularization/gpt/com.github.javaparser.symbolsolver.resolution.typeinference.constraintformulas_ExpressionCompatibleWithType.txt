    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.constraintformulas.ExpressionCompatibleWithType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ExpressionCompatibleWithType has a high number of outgoing dependencies (examples: FunctionalInterfaceLogic, Pair, InferenceVariable, JavaParserFacade, ResolvedType, Statement, TypeSolver, Expression, TypeInferenceCache, ControlFlowLogic, TypeInference, BoundSet, LambdaExpr, MethodType, EnclosedExpr, BlockStmt, TypeHelper, ConditionalExpr), indicating substantial fan-out across many packages. However, it has only a single incoming dependency in the provided data (referenced by com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeInference). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires having dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here fan-out is large but fan-in is minimal, so the class does not meet the definition of a hub."
