    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class Added has a small set of outgoing dependencies (TextElement, DifferenceElement, LexicalDifferenceCalculator, CsmElement) and only a single incoming dependency (Difference). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections; Added does not exhibit a large number of incoming dependents despite one outgoing dependency (LexicalDifferenceCalculator) itself being highly connected."
