    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of both outgoing and incoming dependencies in the provided data: 20 outgoing dependencies (examples: DifferenceElementCalculator, CsmConditional, CsmAttribute, CsmList, NodeText, CsmSingleReference, CsmSequence, CsmMix, ConcreteSyntaxModel, CsmElement, Node, Difference) and 8 incoming dependencies (examples: Kept, DifferenceElementCalculator, LexicalPreservingPrinter, Removed, Difference, RemovedGroup, DifferenceElement, Added). This bidirectional connectivity to many distinct abstractions (AST Node, concrete-syntax model classes, lexical-preservation classes, printers and tokens) matches the Hub-like Modularization smell, where the abstraction acts as a central hub with numerous incoming and outgoing relationships."
