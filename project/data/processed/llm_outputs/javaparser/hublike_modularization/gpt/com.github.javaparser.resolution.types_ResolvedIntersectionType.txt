    "justification": "ResolvedIntersectionType has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.type.IntersectionType). While one outgoing dependency (ResolvedType) itself depends on many types, ResolvedIntersectionType does not exhibit a large number of direct incoming and outgoing relationships required to classify it as a hub."
