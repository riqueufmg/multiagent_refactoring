    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Java5Validator has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator and com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships; in isolation this class does not exhibit a large number of incoming or outgoing connections. Although the two outgoing targets themselves list multiple dependencies, the class under analysis only directly depends on two abstractions, so it is not a hub."
