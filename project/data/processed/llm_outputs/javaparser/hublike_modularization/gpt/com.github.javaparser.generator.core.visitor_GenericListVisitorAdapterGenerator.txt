    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only five outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BaseNodeMetaModel, com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.BlockStmt, com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; this class lacks incoming connections and its outgoing degree is small, so the smell is not present."
