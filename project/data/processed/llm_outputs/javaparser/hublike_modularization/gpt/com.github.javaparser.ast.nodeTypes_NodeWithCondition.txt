    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NodeWithCondition has 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although the referenced Expression type itself depends on many other types (≈47 listed), NodeWithCondition in isolation only directly depends on a single abstraction and has no incoming ties, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
