    "justification": "TextElementMatcher has 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElement) and is referenced by 3 incoming classes (NodeText, TextElement, TextElementMatchers). There are 3 distinct other abstractions interacting with this class. This is a small number of both incoming and outgoing relationships, so it does not constitute a hub-like modularization."
