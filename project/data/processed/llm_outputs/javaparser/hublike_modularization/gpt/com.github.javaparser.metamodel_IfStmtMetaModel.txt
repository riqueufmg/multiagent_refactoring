    "detection": false,
    "justification": "IfStmtMetaModel has a small number of dependencies in the provided data: only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and 2 incoming dependents (com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.IfStmt and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing. The metrics here show limited fan-out (1) and limited fan-in (2), so it does not meet the hub-like criterion. Note: although JavaParserMetaModel itself references many meta-model classes, that represents a single incoming dependency source rather than many distinct incoming dependents for IfStmtMetaModel."
