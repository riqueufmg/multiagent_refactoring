    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has a single incoming dependency from com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.SwitchEntry only. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; here there is only one incoming and zero outgoing relationships, so it is not a hub."
