    "justification": "CsmString has outgoing dependencies to only three abstractions (com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node) and has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; these conditions are not met for CsmString. (Although some referenced classes like Node have many dependencies, the analysis is limited to CsmString in isolation.)"
