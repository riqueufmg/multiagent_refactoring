    "justification": "ResolvedTypeTransformer has only 2 incoming dependents (com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem.ReferenceTypeImpl, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedReferenceType) and a single outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). The counts of incoming and outgoing relationships are low; therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization in the provided data."
