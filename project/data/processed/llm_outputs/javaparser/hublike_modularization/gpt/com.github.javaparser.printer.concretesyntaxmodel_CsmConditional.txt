    "justification": "CsmConditional has a small set of direct outgoing dependencies (5): com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmElement, com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmConditional.Condition, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty, com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter. It is referenced by a modest number of incoming dependencies (4): com.github.javaparser.printer.ConcreteSyntaxModel, com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmElement, com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalDifferenceCalculator, com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.changes.Change. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the counts here are small. Note that some outgoing targets (e.g. Node) have many transitive dependencies, but considering the class in isolation and its direct relations, CsmConditional does not exhibit hub-like coupling."
