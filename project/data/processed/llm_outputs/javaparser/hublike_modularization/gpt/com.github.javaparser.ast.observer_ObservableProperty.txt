    "justification": "ObservableProperty has a very large number of incoming dependencies from many packages and classes (examples: com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Type, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, many com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.* classes like MethodCallExpr and Name, and printer/lexicalpreservation classes such as com.github.javaparser.printer.ConcreteSyntaxModel and com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalPreservingPrinter), indicating it is widely used. However, its outgoing dependency set is small (only 4 listed: com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty.Type, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList, com.github.javaparser.utils.Utils). Because hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of dependencies in both directions (many incoming and many outgoing), ObservableProperty does not meet the definition: incoming dependencies are numerous but outgoing dependencies are limited."
