    "justification": "Incoming dependencies are empty (no other abstractions depend on this class). Outgoing dependencies are limited to three abstractions: com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.TypePatternExpr, and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserSymbolDeclaration. Although those target classes list multiple dependencies of their own, the analyzed class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing ties required for Hub-like Modularization."
