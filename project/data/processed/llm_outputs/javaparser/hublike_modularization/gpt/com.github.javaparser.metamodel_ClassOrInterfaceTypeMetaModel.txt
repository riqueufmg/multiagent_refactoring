    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ClassOrInterfaceTypeMetaModel has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and 2 incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ClassOrInterfaceType and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions. Although JavaParserMetaModel itself depends on many meta-model classes (including ClassOrInterfaceTypeMetaModel), ClassOrInterfaceTypeMetaModel does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
