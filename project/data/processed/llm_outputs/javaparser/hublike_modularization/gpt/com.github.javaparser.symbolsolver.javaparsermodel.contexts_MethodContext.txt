    "justification": "MethodContext has outgoing dependencies to three abstractions (com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node) but has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because incoming dependencies = 0, MethodContext does not meet the definition of a hub."
