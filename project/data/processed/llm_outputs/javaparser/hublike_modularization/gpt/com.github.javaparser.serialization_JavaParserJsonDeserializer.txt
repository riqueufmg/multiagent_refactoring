    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and 9 outgoing dependencies: StaticJavaParser, BaseNodeMetaModel, CompilationUnit, Node, JavaParserMetaModel, PropertyMetaModel, NodeList, Position, JavaToken. Because there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing dependency set is limited in size, the class does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
