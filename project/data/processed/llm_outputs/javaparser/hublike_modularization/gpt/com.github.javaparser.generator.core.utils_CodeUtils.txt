    "justification": "CodeUtils has only one direct outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Type) and only one incoming dependency (com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.PropertyGenerator). Although the Type class shows many dependencies, those are indirect/transitive from CodeUtils. The provided data shows CodeUtils does not have a large number of distinct incoming and outgoing direct relationships required to classify it as Hub-like Modularization."
