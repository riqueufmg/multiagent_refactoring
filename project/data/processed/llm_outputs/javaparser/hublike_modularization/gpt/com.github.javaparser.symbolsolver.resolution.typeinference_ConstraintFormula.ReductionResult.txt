    "justification": "ReductionResult has 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet) and 1 incoming dependency (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ConstraintFormula). Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; ReductionResult shows only a single incoming and a single outgoing dependency, so it is not a hub. (BoundSet has many dependencies, but those are not direct dependencies of ReductionResult.)"
