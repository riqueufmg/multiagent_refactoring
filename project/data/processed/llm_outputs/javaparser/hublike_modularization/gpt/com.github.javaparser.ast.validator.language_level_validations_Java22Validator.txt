    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Java22Validator has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.ProblemReporter, com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because incoming dependencies are absent and the outgoing count is small, the smell is not detected for this class."
