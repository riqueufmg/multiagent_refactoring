    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here, Parsedness has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.ast.Node). Although Node's dependency list includes Node.Parsedness among many entries, Parsedness itself is referenced by a single class and does not depend on other abstractions. Counts: incoming clients = 1, outgoing dependencies = 0. Therefore it is not a hub."
