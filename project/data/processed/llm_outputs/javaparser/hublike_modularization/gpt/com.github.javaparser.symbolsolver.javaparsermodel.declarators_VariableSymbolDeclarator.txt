    "justification": "Incoming dependencies are empty (no other abstractions depend on this class). Outgoing dependencies are limited to three abstractions: com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.VariableDeclarationExpr, and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserSymbolDeclaration. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has neither a large number of incoming nor outgoing connections, so it is not a hub."
