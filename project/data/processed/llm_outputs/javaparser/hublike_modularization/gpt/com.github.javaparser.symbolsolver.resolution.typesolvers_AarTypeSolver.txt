    "justification": "AarTypeSolver has a small number of outgoing dependencies (3: com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.JarTypeSolver) and a single incoming dependency (1: com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.TypeSolverBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low incoming and outgoing counts, so the smell is not detected."
