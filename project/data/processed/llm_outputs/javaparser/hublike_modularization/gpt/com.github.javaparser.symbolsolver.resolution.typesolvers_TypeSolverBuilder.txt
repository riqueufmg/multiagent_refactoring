    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeSolverBuilder has multiple outgoing dependencies (6): com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, JavaParserTypeSolver, ReflectionTypeSolver, AarTypeSolver, ClassLoaderTypeSolver, JarTypeSolver, but it has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The absence of incoming dependencies prevents this class from being a hub."
