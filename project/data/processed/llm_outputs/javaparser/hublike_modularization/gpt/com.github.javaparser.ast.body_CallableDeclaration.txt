    "detection": true,
    "justification": "CallableDeclaration has many outgoing dependencies (12) to diverse core abstractions and infrastructure: CallableDeclaration.Signature, ReceiverParameter, NodeList, SimpleName, TokenRange, ObservableProperty, JavaParserMetaModel, ArrayType, Node, Type, Parameter, CallableDeclarationMetaModel. It also has multiple incoming dependencies (4) from higher-level abstractions that use it: TypeDeclaration, BodyDeclaration, AbstractGenerator, Generator. The combination of numerous outgoing links to core AST types, meta-model and observer/token types, plus several incoming links from important container/generator classes, indicates the class acts as a hub connecting many unrelated abstractions, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
