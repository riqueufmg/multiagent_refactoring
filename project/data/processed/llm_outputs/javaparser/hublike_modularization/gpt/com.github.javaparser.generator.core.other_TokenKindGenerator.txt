    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. TokenKindGenerator has outgoing dependencies to 8 other abstractions (EnumDeclaration, IntegerLiteralExpr, CompilationUnit, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, EnumConstantDeclaration, SwitchStmt, SwitchEntry, SourceRoot) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies, it does not meet the 'both incoming and outgoing with a large number' criterion and therefore is not a hub."
