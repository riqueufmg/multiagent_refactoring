    "detection": false,
    "justification": "BinaryExprContext has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct abstractions (PatternVariableResult, TypeSolver, PatternVariableVisitor, Node, BinaryExpr) but has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies in the provided data, BinaryExprContext is not a hub-like module."
