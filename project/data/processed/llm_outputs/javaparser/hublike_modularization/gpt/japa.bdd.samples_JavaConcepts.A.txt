Incoming dependencies: 1 entry (japa.bdd.samples.JavaConcepts) which lists dependencies [com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, japa.bdd.samples.JavaConcepts.A, japa.bdd.samples.JavaConcepts.QWE]. With only one incoming relation and zero outgoing relations, the class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions and therefore is not a hub-like module."
