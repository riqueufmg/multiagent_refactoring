    "detection": true,
    "justification": "BodyDeclaration has a large number of outgoing dependencies (21 distinct abstractions) including many specific body types and core AST primitives: EnumConstantDeclaration, TypeDeclaration, AnnotationDeclaration, AnnotationMemberDeclaration, InitializerDeclaration, FieldDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, ConstructorDeclaration, RecordDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, CallableDeclaration, CompactConstructorDeclaration, Node, NodeList, TokenRange, ObservableProperty, Range, JavaParserMetaModel, BodyDeclarationMetaModel, Utils, etc. It also has many incoming dependencies (8 distinct abstractions) from major components that treat it as a central element: TypeDeclaration, NodeWithMembers, ObjectCreationExpr, JavaParser, StaticJavaParser, JavaParserAdapter, GeneratedJavaParser, NodeMetaModelGenerator. Several elements appear in both directions (e.g., TypeDeclaration, Node, NodeList, JavaParserMetaModel/BodyDeclarationMetaModel, ObservableProperty, TokenRange), indicating bidirectional coupling with many parts of the system. The combination of high outgoing and high incoming coupling across many different abstractions (core AST nodes, parser components, and metamodel utilities) meets the definition of a hub-like modularization."
