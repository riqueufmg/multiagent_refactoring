    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (no other abstractions depend on it) and only 3 direct outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserSymbolDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.FieldDeclaration. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows no incoming edges and a small number of outgoing edges, so the smell is not present."
