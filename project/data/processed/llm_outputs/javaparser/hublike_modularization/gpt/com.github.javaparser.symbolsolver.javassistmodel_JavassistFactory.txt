    "detection": true,
    "justification": "JavassistFactory has a large number of incoming dependencies (10 distinct client classes) and multiple outgoing dependencies (6 distinct abstractions), indicating bidirectional connectivity typical of a hub. Incoming dependents include JarTypeSolver and many package peers: JavassistEnumDeclaration, JavassistMethodDeclaration, JavassistInterfaceDeclaration, JavassistConstructorDeclaration, JavassistRecordDeclaration, JavassistFieldDeclaration, JavassistClassDeclaration, JavassistParameterDeclaration, and JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter — showing many classes rely on this factory. Outgoing dependencies include core resolution and AST abstractions: com.github.javaparser.ast.AccessSpecifier, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, ResolvedPrimitiveType, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, and ResolvedVoidType. Because it both depends on and is depended on by many core types and many peers, it functions as a hub-like abstraction."
