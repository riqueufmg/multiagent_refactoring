    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.NoCommentHashCodeVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. The provided data shows NoCommentHashCodeVisitor has a large number of outgoing dependencies (e.g., TraditionalJavadocComment, WildcardType, UnaryExpr, TextBlockLiteralExpr, ModuleDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, VariableDeclarator, SimpleName, Node, CompilationUnit, ClassOrInterfaceType, many AST node and type classes) but zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is an empty list). Because there are no incoming dependencies, this class does not satisfy the 'both incoming and outgoing with a large number' criterion, so it is not detected as hub-like."
