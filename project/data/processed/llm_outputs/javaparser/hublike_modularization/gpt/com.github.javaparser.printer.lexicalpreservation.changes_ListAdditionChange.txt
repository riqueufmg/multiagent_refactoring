    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only 4 outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.changes.NoChange, com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty, and com.github.javaparser.ast.Node. Because there are no incoming dependencies and only a small set of outgoing links, it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
