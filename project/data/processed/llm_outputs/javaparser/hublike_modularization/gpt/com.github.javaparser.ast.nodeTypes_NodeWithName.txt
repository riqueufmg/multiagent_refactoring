    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. NodeWithName has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Name, com.github.javaparser.StaticJavaParser, com.github.javaparser.utils.Utils). Because there are no incoming dependencies and the outgoing set is small, it does not meet the hub-like criterion."
