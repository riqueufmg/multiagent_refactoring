    "justification": "com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorList has a single outgoing dependency: com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitor, and a single incoming dependency: com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorList.EqualsHashcodeOverridingFacade. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here both incoming and outgoing counts are low. (While GenericVisitor itself depends on many AST classes, those are dependencies of GenericVisitor, not direct dependencies of VisitorList.)"
