    "justification": "Not a hub: Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. This class has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []) and only three direct outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, and com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ArrayAccessExpr. Although those outgoing classes themselves reference other types, the analyzed class lacks the large number of both incoming and outgoing links required to be considered a hub."
