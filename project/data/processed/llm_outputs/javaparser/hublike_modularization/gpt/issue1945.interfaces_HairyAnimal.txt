    "justification": "HairyAnimal has 3 incoming dependencies (issue1945.implementations.WoolRenderer, issue1945.main.MainIssue1945, issue1945.interfaces.HairTypeRenderer) and 1 outgoing dependency (issue1945.interfaces.HairType). The total number of distinct incoming/outgoing relationships is small, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (no large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies)."
