    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Java9Validator has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator and com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.SingleNodeTypeValidator). Because there are no incoming links and the number of outgoing links is small, the conditions for a hub-like modularization smell are not met."
