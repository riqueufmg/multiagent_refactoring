    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are empty (no outgoing links). Incoming dependencies are only two classes: com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.EmptyStmt and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; EmptyStmtMetaModel has neither a large number of incoming nor any outgoing dependencies. Note: although JavaParserMetaModel lists many dependencies, that only indicates one incoming connection to EmptyStmtMetaModel, not many bidirectional links."
