    "justification": "JsonNode has only one outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel) and only one incoming depender (com.github.javaparser.serialization.JavaParserJsonSerializer). Although JavaParserMetaModel itself lists many dependent meta-model classes, those are indirect and not direct incoming/outgoing dependencies of JsonNode. With only a single direct incoming and a single direct outgoing link, JsonNode does not meet the criterion of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions and therefore is not a hub-like module."
