    "justification": "UpgradeJavaMessage has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration) and 1 incoming dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.ProblemReporter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; the provided data shows a single incoming and a single outgoing relation, so it does not qualify as hub-like."
