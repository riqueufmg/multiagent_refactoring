    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.BinaryExpr.Operator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.BinaryExpr) and one outgoing dependency (to com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.AssignExpr). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low incoming and outgoing dependency counts, so the smell is not present."
