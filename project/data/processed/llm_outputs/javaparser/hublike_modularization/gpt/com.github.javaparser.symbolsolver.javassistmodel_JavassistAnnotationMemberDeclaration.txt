    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and 4 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies and a small set of outgoing dependencies indicates this is not a hub."
