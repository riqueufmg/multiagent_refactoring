    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. CommonValidators has outgoing dependencies to three provided abstractions: com.github.javaparser.metamodel.NodeMetaModel, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression, and com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList (Expression itself references many classes transitively). However, the analysis shows zero incoming dependencies for CommonValidators. Because there are no incoming dependencies, the class does not exhibit the required pattern of having both large incoming and outgoing coupling, so the smell is not detected."
