    "detection": true,
    "justification": "RecordPatternExpr has a substantial number of both outgoing and incoming dependencies. Outgoing: 10 direct dependencies (Node, Type, NodeList, VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, JavaParserMetaModel, TokenRange, ReferenceType, ObservableProperty, RecordPatternExprMetaModel). Incoming: at least 20 distinct abstractions depend on it (numerous visitor and core classes such as VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, HashCodeVisitor, EqualsVisitor, CloneVisitor, PrettyPrintVisitor, DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor, GeneratedJavaParser, Expression, and many Void/Generic visitor adapters). The presence of many incoming edges (widely referenced by visitors/parsers) combined with multiple outgoing edges to core AST/meta-model types shows the class acts as a hub linking many abstractions, meeting the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
