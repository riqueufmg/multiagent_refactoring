    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and 10 outgoing dependencies (SymbolReference, JavaParserAnonymousClassDeclaration, JavaParserFacade, TypeSolver, NodeList, ObjectCreationExpr, ReflectionClassDeclaration, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, JavaParserFactory, MethodResolutionLogic). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; here the incoming degree is zero, so the hub-like smell is not present."
