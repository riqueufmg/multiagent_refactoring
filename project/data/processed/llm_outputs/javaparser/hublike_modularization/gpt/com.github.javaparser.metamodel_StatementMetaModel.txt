    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.StatementMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "StatementMetaModel has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has only two incoming dependents: com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.Statement and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel (incoming count = 2). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; StatementMetaModel lacks outgoing links and has only two incoming links, so it is not a hub."
