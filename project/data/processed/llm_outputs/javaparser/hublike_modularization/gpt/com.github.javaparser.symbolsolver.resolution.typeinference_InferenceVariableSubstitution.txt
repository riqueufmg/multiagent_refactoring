    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 6 distinct classes reference InferenceVariableSubstitution (Bound, SubtypeOfBound, CapturesBound, SameAsBound, FalseBound, ThrowsBound). Outgoing dependencies: only 2 distinct classes are depended on by InferenceVariableSubstitution (InferenceVariable, ResolvedType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. While this class has several incoming references, its outgoing dependency set is small (2), so it does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
