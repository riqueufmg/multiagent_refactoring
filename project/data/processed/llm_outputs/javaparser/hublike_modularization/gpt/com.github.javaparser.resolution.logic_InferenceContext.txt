    "detection": true,
    "justification": "InferenceContext has broad outgoing coupling to 8 core resolution abstractions (ResolvedReferenceType, TypeSolver, ResolvedType, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, InferenceVariableType, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedLambdaConstraintType) while being referenced by 7 distinct clients (MethodDeclarationCommonLogic, ReflectionAnnotationDeclaration, ReflectionEnumDeclaration, ReflectionInterfaceDeclaration, TypeExtractor, LambdaExprContext, MethodReferenceExprContext). The incoming callers come from multiple packages and varied responsibilities (symbolsolver.declarations.common, reflectionmodel, javaparsermodel, javaparsermodel.contexts), and the outgoing targets are central type/resolution classes. This combination of many incoming and many outgoing connections demonstrates a hub-like modularization smell."
