    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ResolvedMethodLikeDeclaration has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (3: ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ResolvedParameterDeclaration, ResolvedType) and a small number of incoming dependents (3: JavaSymbolSolver, JavassistMethodLikeDeclarationAdapter, MethodResolutionLogic). Although one outgoing neighbor (ResolvedType) itself depends on many types, the smell definition requires the abstraction itself to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. Given only 3 incoming and 3 outgoing direct relationships in the provided data, this class does not qualify as hub-like modularization."
