    "justification": "Navigator has a large number of both outgoing and incoming dependencies. Outgoing dependencies (11) include: com.github.javaparser.ast.body.EnumDeclaration, ConstructorDeclaration, CompilationUnit, TypeDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, Node, VariableDeclarator, MethodDeclaration, SwitchStmt, FieldDeclaration, ReturnStmt. Incoming dependencies (21) include many core symbol-solver and context classes such as JavaSymbolSolver, JavaParserFacade, JavaParserFactory, TypeExtractor, JavaParserMethodDeclaration, various JavaParser* declarations, multiple context classes (LambdaExprContext, MethodReferenceExprContext, ForEachStatementContext, ForStatementContext, TryWithResourceContext, SwitchEntryContext), and JavaParserTypeSolver. Because Navigator is referenced by many other abstractions and itself depends on many AST node types, it matches the Hub-like Modularization smell (high both-way coupling)."
