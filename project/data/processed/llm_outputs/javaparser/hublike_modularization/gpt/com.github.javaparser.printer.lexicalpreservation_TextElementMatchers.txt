    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElementMatchers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TextElementMatchers has a small number of direct outgoing dependencies (3): TextElement, TextElementMatcher, and com.github.javaparser.ast.Node. It has a single incoming dependency from NodeText. The total set of directly connected abstractions is therefore limited (4 distinct classes). Although one of its outgoing targets (Node) itself has many dependencies, the analysis must consider the class in isolation; TextElementMatchers does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships and thus does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
