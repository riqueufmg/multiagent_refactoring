    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.Solver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization requires the abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Solver has 7 outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.Context, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.MethodUsage, and com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Type. It has only 2 incoming dependents in the provided data: com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.TypeExtractor. Because the number of distinct incoming dependents is low (2) and the outgoing dependency set is modest (7), the class does not meet the criterion of having both many incoming and many outgoing connections and therefore is not detected as a hub-like modularization."
