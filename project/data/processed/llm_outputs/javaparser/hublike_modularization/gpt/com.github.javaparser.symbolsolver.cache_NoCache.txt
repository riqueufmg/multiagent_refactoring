    "justification": "NoCache has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.resolution.cache.CacheStats) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing relationships; the provided data does not show a large number of dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
