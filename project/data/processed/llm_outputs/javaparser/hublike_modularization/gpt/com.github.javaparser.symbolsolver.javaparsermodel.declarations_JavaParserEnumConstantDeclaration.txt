    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 4 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.body.EnumConstantDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.resolution.Navigator). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; the provided data shows no incoming links and a small number of outgoing links, so the smell is not present."
