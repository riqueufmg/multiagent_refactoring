    "justification": "ResolvedValueDeclaration has a single outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType) and a modest number of incoming dependents (6 distinct classes: com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.JavaSymbolSolver; com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.TryWithResourceContext; com.github.javaparser.ast.body.VariableDeclarator; com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.NameExpr; com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.FieldAccessExpr; com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.Value). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here outgoing degree = 1 and incoming degree = 6, which does not constitute a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
