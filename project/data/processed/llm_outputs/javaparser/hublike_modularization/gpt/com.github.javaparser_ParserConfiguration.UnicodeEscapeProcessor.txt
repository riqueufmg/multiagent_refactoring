    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming_dependencies: [] and outgoing count = 1, so it does not qualify."
