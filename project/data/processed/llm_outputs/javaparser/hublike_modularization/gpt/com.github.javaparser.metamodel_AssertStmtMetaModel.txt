    "justification": "AssertStmtMetaModel has a small number of incoming and outgoing relations: incoming from com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.AssertStmt and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel (2 incoming abstractions) and a single outgoing dependency to com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel (1 outgoing abstraction). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; these counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
