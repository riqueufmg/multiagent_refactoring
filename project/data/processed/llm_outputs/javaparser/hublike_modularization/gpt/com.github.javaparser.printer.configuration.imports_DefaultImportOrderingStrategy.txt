    "justification": "DefaultImportOrderingStrategy has a single outgoing dependency: com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList. It has a single incoming dependent class in the provided data: com.github.javaparser.printer.DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor (which references DefaultImportOrderingStrategy among many other types). Because there is only one distinct incoming class and one outgoing dependency listed, the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization (it does not have both many incoming and many outgoing relationships)."
