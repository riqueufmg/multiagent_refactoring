    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithIdentifier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NodeWithIdentifier has only one direct outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.utils.Utils) and zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization is characterized by an abstraction having many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class has a single direct connection and therefore does not meet that criterion. (Although Utils has its own dependencies — UnaryExpr, LineSeparator, Node, Provider — those are indirect and, per the isolation constraint, are not counted toward NodeWithIdentifier's direct coupling.)"
