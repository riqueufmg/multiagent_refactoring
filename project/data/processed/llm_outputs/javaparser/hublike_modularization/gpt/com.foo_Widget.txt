    "class": "com.foo.Widget",

    "justification": "Widget has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct abstractions (com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.CombinedTypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ParseException, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade) but has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; because there are no incoming dependencies for Widget, the hub-like smell is not present."
