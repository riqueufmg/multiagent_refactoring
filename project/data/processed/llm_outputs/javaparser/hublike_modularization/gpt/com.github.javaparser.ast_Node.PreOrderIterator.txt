    "justification": "No incoming or outgoing dependencies were detected (incoming_dependencies = 0, outgoing_dependencies = 0). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; this class has neither, so it is not a hub."
