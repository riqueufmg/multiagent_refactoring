    "justification": "Not detected: the class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionEnumDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType) but has no incoming dependencies (incoming count = 0). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the absence of incoming dependencies prevents this class from being a hub."
