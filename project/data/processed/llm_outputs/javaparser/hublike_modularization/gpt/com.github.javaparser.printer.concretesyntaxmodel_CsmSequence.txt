    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CsmSequence has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node) and only 1 incoming depender in the provided data (com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalDifferenceCalculator). While the outgoing targets (SourcePrinter and Node) themselves list many dependencies, the class under analysis directly connects to only a small number of other abstractions (outgoing=2, incoming=1). Therefore, based on the provided data and considering the class in isolation, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
