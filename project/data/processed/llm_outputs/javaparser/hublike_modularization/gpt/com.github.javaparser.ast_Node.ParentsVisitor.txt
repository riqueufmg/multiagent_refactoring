    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Node.ParentsVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ParentsVisitor has a single outgoing dependency: com.github.javaparser.ast.Node (dependencies list contains only that entry) and it has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. While the provided outgoing_dependencies show many dependencies for class Node, those belong to com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, not to Node.ParentsVisitor. Therefore, Node.ParentsVisitor does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
