    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.Value",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Value has only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedValueDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType) while it has 6 incoming dependents (StatementContext, LambdaExprContext, ClassOrInterfaceDeclarationContext, TryWithResourceContext, RecordDeclarationContext, Context). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Here the incoming set is moderate but the outgoing set is small (2), so Value does not meet the \"hub\" criterion. (Note: ResolvedType—one of the two outgoing dependencies—itself lists many dependent types in the provided data, but Value's direct outgoing fan-out remains low.)"
