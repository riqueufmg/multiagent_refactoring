    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ResolvedTypeVariable has a moderate number of incoming dependencies (7 distinct clients: ReflectionMethodResolutionLogic, MethodCallExprContext, TypeParameter, LazyType, ResolvedType, ResolvedReferenceType, MethodResolutionLogic) indicating it is widely used. However, its outgoing dependency set is small (3 dependencies: com.github.javaparser.resolution.Context, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration). The smell requires the abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing ties; here only incoming ties are numerous while outgoing ties remain limited, so it does not meet the hub-like modularization criteria."
