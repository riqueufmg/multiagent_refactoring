    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.CompilationUnitGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit and com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing couplings. Although the two outgoing targets themselves reference many types (CompilationUnit -> ~25 types, SourceRoot -> ~9 types), those are not direct incoming dependencies of CompilationUnitGenerator, so the class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
