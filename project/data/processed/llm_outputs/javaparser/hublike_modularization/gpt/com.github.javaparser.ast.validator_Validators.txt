    "justification": "Validators has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.ProblemReporter, com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class lacks incoming dependencies and has a small number of outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not detected."
