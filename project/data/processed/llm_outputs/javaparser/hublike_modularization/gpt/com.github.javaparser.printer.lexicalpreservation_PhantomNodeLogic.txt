    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PhantomNodeLogic has only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.AstObserver and com.github.javaparser.ast.Node) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The observed low outgoing count (2) and absence of incoming dependencies do not meet that criterion. Although one of its targets (Node) itself depends on many classes, that transitive connectivity does not make PhantomNodeLogic a hub when considered in isolation."
