    "justification": "NodeWithSimpleName is not a hub. Incoming dependencies are empty (no classes depend on it) and it has only three direct outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.NameExpr, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.SimpleName, and com.github.javaparser.utils.Utils. Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing links; these counts are low. (Although the outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, that does not make NodeWithSimpleName a hub because it lacks numerous direct incoming/outgoing relationships.)"
