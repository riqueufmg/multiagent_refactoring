    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.body.RecordDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.ProblemReporter, com.github.javaparser.ast.Modifier). Although those three target classes themselves reference many other abstractions (RecordDeclaration -> 11 deps, ProblemReporter -> 3 deps, Modifier -> 9 deps), the analyzed class does not exhibit both large incoming and large outgoing coupling required for Hub-like Modularization."
