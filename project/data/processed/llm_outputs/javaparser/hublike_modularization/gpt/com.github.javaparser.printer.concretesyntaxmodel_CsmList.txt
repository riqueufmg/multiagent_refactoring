    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CsmList has 7 outgoing dependencies (ConcreteSyntaxModel, Node, CsmElement, NodeList, ObservableProperty, PrintingHelper, SourcePrinter) and a single incoming dependency (LexicalDifferenceCalculator). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and many outgoing connections; here the incoming fan-in is low (1) and the outgoing fan-out is moderate and largely confined to a small set of related parser/printer types, so it does not qualify as a hub."
