    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.RecordDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "RecordDeclarationMetaModel has a very small number of dependencies: only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and only 2 incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.body.RecordDeclaration and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing ties with a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are low, so this class is not a hub."
