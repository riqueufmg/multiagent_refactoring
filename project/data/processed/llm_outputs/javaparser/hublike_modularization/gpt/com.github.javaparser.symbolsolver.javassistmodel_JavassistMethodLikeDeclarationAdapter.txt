    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistMethodLikeDeclarationAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively small number of dependencies: 6 outgoing dependencies (ResolvedParameterDeclaration, ResolvedType, TypeSolver, ResolvedMethodLikeDeclaration, JavassistUtils, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration) and 2 incoming dependencies (JavassistMethodDeclaration, JavassistConstructorDeclaration). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions. The incoming set is limited to two closely related classes and the outgoing set is modest, so this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
