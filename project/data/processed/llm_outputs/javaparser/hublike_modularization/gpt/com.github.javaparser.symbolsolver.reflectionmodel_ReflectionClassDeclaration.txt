    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionClassDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ReflectionClassDeclaration has a large number of outgoing dependencies (19 distinct abstractions) including ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, TypeSolver, ReflectionMethodDeclaration, MethodResolutionLogic, ResolvedReferenceType, SymbolReference, ResolvedType, ReflectionFactory, ReflectionClassAdapter, Node, MethodUsage, AccessSpecifier, ResolvedMethodDeclaration and ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration. However, it has a small set of incoming dependencies (3 distinct clients): AnonymousClassDeclarationContext, JavaParserTypeDeclarationAdapter, and SymbolSolver. Because the hub-like modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many dependencies both incoming and outgoing, the asymmetry here (many outgoing but only a few incoming) indicates the class is not a hub in the sense defined."
