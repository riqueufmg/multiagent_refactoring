    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. In isolation, EnumDeclarationContext has 5 outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.JavaParserTypeDeclarationAdapter, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.EnumDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, and 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies (and thus it does not exhibit the required many-to-many coupling), the smell is not detected."
