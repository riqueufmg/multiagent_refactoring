    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MethodComparator has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ClassComparator, ParameterComparator) and only 2 incoming dependents (ReflectionClassDeclaration, ReflectionRecordDeclaration). The total number of distinct connected abstractions is small and does not show the large many-to-many incoming/outgoing connectivity characteristic of a hub-like modularization. (Note: ParameterComparator's dependency on ClassComparator does not increase MethodComparator's incoming/outgoing degree.)"
