    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. MethodCallExprContext has many outgoing dependencies (analyzed_package.dependencies count = 19; outgoing_dependencies entries = 20, e.g. NameExpr, ResolvedTypeVariable, MethodResolutionLogic, JavaParserFacade, ResolvedType, MethodCallExpr, ContextHelper, ReferenceTypeImpl, MethodUsage, etc.) but has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies count = 0). Because there are no incoming dependencies, it does not meet the definition of a hub (highly connected both ways), so the smell is not detected."
