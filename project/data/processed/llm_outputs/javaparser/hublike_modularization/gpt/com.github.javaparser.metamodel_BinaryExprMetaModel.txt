    "justification": "BinaryExprMetaModel has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and only 2 incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.BinaryExpr and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Hub-like Modularization is characterized by an abstraction having many incoming and many outgoing connections; the provided data shows small counts on both sides, so this class does not exhibit a hub-like modularization smell."
