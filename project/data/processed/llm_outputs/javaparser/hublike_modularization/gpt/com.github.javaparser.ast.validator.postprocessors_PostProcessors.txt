    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PostProcessors has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes (com.github.javaparser.Processor, com.github.javaparser.ParseResult, com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration) and incoming dependencies from 2 classes (com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration, com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration.LanguageLevel). The total number of distinct other abstractions involved is 4, and although there is a mutual dependency with ParserConfiguration, the number of incoming and outgoing relationships is small and does not meet the \"large number of other abstractions\" criterion for Hub-like Modularization."
