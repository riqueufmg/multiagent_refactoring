    "justification": "CatchClauseMetaModel has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and only 2 incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.CatchClause and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows limited incoming/outgoing links for CatchClauseMetaModel. (Note: PropertyMetaModel and JavaParserMetaModel themselves reference many other types, but that does not make CatchClauseMetaModel a hub given its own low degree of incoming/outgoing dependencies.)"
