    "justification": "ConfigurablePrinter has only two outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.printer.Printer and com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.PrinterConfiguration) and a single incoming dependency from com.github.javaparser.ast.Node. The total number of distinct incoming/outgoing connected abstractions is small (3), so it does not exhibit the many-to-many dependency pattern characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
