    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NodeWithTokenRange has a single outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.TokenRange) and a single incoming dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.ProblemReporter). The outgoing TokenRange further depends on JavaToken, but NodeWithTokenRange itself does not show many direct incoming or outgoing relationships. Because both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are low (one each), this does not meet the 'large number of other abstractions' criterion for Hub-like Modularization."
