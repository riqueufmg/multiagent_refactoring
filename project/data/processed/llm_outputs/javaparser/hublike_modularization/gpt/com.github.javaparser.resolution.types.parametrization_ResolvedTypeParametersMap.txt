    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of outgoing dependencies (3: ResolvedTypeParametersMap.Builder, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration) and a small number of incoming dependencies (5: JavaParserEnumDeclaration, MethodUsage, ReferenceTypeImpl, ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedTypeParametrized). Because Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, the observed counts (total distinct related abstractions = 8) do not indicate a hub-like role."
