    "detection": false,
    "justification": "PrettyPrinter has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = 0) and only five direct outgoing dependencies (Printer, VoidVisitor, Node, PrettyPrinterConfiguration, PrinterConfiguration). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships. Although some of the outgoing targets (e.g. VoidVisitor, Node) themselves reference many types, the PrettyPrinter class itself does not show a large number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies, so it does not qualify as a hub."
