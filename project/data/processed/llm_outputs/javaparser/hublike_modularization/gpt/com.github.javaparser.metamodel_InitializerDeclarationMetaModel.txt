    "detection": false,
    "justification": "InitializerDeclarationMetaModel has a very small set of direct dependencies: 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and 2 incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.body.InitializerDeclaration and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Although JavaParserMetaModel depends on many meta-model classes (including InitializerDeclarationMetaModel), that makes JavaParserMetaModel a hub, not InitializerDeclarationMetaModel. The class itself does not have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
