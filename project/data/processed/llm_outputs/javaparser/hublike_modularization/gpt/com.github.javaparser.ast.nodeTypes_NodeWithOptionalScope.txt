    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (none). Direct outgoing dependencies: 1 -> com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. NodeWithOptionalScope has only a single direct outgoing dependency and no incoming dependencies. (Note: com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression itself lists many dependent types, but those are indirect; per the requirement to consider the class in isolation, they do not make NodeWithOptionalScope a hub.)"
