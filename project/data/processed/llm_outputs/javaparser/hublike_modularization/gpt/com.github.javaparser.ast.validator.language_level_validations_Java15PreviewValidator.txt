    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 0 outgoing dependencies (incoming_dependencies: [], outgoing_dependencies: []). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; since both dependency lists are empty, this class does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell."
