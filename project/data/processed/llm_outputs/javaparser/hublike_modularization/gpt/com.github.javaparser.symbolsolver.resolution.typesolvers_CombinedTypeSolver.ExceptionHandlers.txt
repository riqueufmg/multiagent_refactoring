    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.CombinedTypeSolver, as shown in incoming_dependencies). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
