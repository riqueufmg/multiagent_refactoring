    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.ObjectIdentityHashCodeVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a very large number of outgoing dependencies (references to many distinct AST types such as TraditionalJavadocComment, WildcardType, UnaryExpr, MethodDeclaration, Node, CompilationUnit, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, etc.), but there are no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing couplings. Because this class lacks incoming dependencies, it does not satisfy the hub-like modularization smell."
