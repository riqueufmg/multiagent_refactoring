    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.MethodReferenceExprContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (18 distinct dependencies: SymbolReference, MethodUsage, FunctionalInterfaceLogic, JavaParserFacade, ResolvedType, VariableDeclarator, ReturnStmt, TypeSolver, ObjectCreationExpr, MethodReferenceExpr, ResolvedMethodDeclaration, ResolvedConstructorDeclaration, ResolvedLambdaConstraintType, Navigator, InferenceContext, MethodResolutionLogic, MethodCallExpr, etc.) but has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; because there are no incoming dependencies, this class does not meet the definition of a hub."
