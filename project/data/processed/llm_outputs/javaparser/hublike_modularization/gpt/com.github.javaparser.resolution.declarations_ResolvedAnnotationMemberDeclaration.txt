    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ResolvedAnnotationMemberDeclaration has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression) and only 2 incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.JavaSymbolSolver and com.github.javaparser.ast.body.AnnotationMemberDeclaration). A Hub-like Modularization would show a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; the provided data shows low fan-in and fan-out for this class (incoming=2, outgoing=1), so the smell is not detected. Note: Expression itself has many dependencies, but the analysis considers the class in isolation and the class does not directly depend on a large set of other abstractions."
