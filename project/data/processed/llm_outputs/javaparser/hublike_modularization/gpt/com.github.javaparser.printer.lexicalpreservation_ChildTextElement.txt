    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.ChildTextElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ChildTextElement has 4 outgoing dependencies: LexicalPreservingVisitor, NodeText, LexicalPreservingPrinter, and Node, and 4 incoming dependents: DifferenceElementCalculator, Difference, TextElementIteratorsFactory, and LexicalPreservingVisitor. The dependency graph is small and concentrated within the lexicalpreservation printing subsystem (same package area) rather than spanning a large number of distinct abstractions. Because the number and scope of both incoming and outgoing connections are limited, it does not meet the criterion for Hub-like Modularization."
