    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ClassExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ClassExpr has a relatively large number of incoming dependencies (~22 distinct callers, mainly many visitor and utility classes), but only 9 outgoing dependencies (VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, JavaParserMetaModel, TokenRange, ObservableProperty, Type, Node, ClassExprMetaModel, Range). The hub-like modularization smell requires both high fan-in and high fan-out; here the outgoing dependency set is not large, so ClassExpr does not meet the criterion for a hub-like abstraction."
