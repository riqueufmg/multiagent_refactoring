    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. ExampleClass has 2 outgoing dependencies (a.b.c.DataObjectFactory, a.b.c.DataObject) and 0 incoming dependencies. The absence of incoming dependencies and the small number of outgoing dependencies indicate it is not a hub."
