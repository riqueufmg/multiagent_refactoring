    "justification": "AstResolutionUtils has a large number of both incoming and outgoing ties: outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions (com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithAnnotations, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithMembers, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFactory) and incoming dependencies from 8 distinct declaration classes (JavaParserTypeVariableDeclaration, JavaParserAnonymousClassDeclaration, JavaParserAnnotationDeclaration, JavaParserTypeAdapter, JavaParserEnumDeclaration, JavaParserRecordDeclaration, JavaParserClassDeclaration, JavaParserInterfaceDeclaration). Many of the outgoing dependencies are core AST and resolution services (Node, NodeWithAnnotations/Members, TypeSolver, SymbolReference, JavaParserFactory), while the incoming set consists of many different declaration types that all depend on AstResolutionUtils. This pattern — a utility used by many different modules and itself depending on many core abstractions — matches the hub-like modularization smell."
