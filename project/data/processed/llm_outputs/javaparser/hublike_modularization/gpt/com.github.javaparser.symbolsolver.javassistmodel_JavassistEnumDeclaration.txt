    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. JavassistEnumDeclaration has 0 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies: []), so it is not a hub. Although it has multiple outgoing dependencies (11 distinct dependencies including AccessSpecifier, SymbolReference, Context, ResolvedType, ResolvedFieldDeclaration, TypeSolver, JavassistFactory, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, JavassistUtils, JavassistClassDeclaration, JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter), the absence of incoming links prevents classification as hub-like."
