    "justification": "Hub-like modularization is not detected: the class has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and only 2 incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.LocalClassDeclarationStmt and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Although JavaParserMetaModel lists many dependencies, LocalClassDeclarationStmtMetaModel itself is referenced by only two abstractions and depends on only one, which does not constitute a hub with large numbers of incoming and outgoing relationships."
