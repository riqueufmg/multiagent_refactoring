    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LeastUpperBoundLogic has 7 outgoing dependencies (ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedType, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, TypeHelper, LeastUpperBoundLogic.TypeSubstitution, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedReferenceType) and 3 incoming dependents (TypeExtractor, MethodCallExprContext, TypeHelper). Although it interacts with several types, the number of incoming dependents is small and the outgoing dependencies are limited to a focused set of type- and inference-related abstractions. Therefore it does not exhibit the characteristic many-to-many incoming and outgoing connectivity required for a hub-like modularization smell."
