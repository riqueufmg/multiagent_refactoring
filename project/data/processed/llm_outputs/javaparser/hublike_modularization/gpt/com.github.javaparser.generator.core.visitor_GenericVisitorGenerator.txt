    "detection": false,
    "justification": "GenericVisitorGenerator has 0 incoming dependencies and only 4 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot, com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BaseNodeMetaModel). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections to other abstractions. The absence of incoming dependencies (and a small number of outgoing dependencies) means this class does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell in isolation."
