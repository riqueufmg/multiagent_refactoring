    "justification": "Not detected as Hub-like Modularization: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 3 incoming dependents (JarTypeSolver, CombinedTypeSolver, TypeSolver). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Here outgoing_dependencies = [] and incoming_dependencies count = 3 (each of JarTypeSolver, CombinedTypeSolver, and TypeSolver list com.github.javaparser.resolution.UnsolvedSymbolException in their dependency lists), which is insufficient to classify it as a hub."
