    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.promotion.ConditionalExprHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ConditionalExprHandler has a small number of direct relationships: only one outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType) and two incoming dependents (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.TypeExtractor and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.promotion.ConditionalExprResolver). Although ResolvedType itself depends on many types, ConditionalExprHandler does not directly depend on those abstractions. Because the class does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing direct dependencies, it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
