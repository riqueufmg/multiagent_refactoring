    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only six outgoing dependencies (StaticJavaParser, BaseNodeMetaModel, CompilationUnit, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, SourceRoot). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships; this class lacks incoming links and the number of outgoing connections is not sufficiently large to qualify as a hub."
