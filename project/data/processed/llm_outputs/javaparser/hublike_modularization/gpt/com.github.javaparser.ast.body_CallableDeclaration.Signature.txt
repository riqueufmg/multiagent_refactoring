    "justification": "CallableDeclaration.Signature has 0 outgoing dependencies (dependencies list is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.ast.body.CallableDeclaration). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criteria."
