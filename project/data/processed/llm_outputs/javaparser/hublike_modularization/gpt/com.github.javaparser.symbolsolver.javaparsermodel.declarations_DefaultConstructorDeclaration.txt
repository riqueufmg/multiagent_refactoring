    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and only 3 direct outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.AccessSpecifier, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedParameterDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections. Although one outgoing dependency (ResolvedType) itself references many types, DefaultConstructorDeclaration does not have the large number of incoming/outgoing relationships required for the smell."
