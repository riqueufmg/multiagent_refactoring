    "detection": false,
    "justification": "CsmUnindent has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 direct outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter and com.github.javaparser.ast.Node). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependency links to a large number of other abstractions. Although the outgoing classes (SourcePrinter and Node) themselves reference many types, those are transitive dependencies of CsmUnindent and do not change the fact that CsmUnindent has few direct incoming/outgoing links. Therefore it is not a hub."
