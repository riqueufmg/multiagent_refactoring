    "justification": "Although Context has a very large number of incoming dependencies (dozens of distinct classes across many packages reference com.github.javaparser.resolution.Context — e.g. MethodDeclarationCommonLogic, JavaParserFacade, many reflectionmodel.* and javaparsermodel.* classes, Solver, multiple ast.type.* classes), its outgoing dependency set is small: only three direct outgoing dependencies are listed (com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.Value, com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here incoming degree is high but outgoing degree is low when the class is considered in isolation, so the smell is not detected."
