    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParser). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Here LookaheadSuccess lacks outgoing dependencies and has a single incoming reference, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
