    "justification": "Reshuffled has a small set of connections: 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmElement, com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.DifferenceElement, com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmMix) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships with other abstractions; the counts and listed dependencies here are limited, so the smell is not present."
