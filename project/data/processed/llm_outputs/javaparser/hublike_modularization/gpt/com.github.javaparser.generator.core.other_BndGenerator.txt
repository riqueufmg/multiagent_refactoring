    "justification": "BndGenerator has only one outgoing dependency: com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot, and it has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced SourceRoot (the single outgoing target) itself lists many dependencies, BndGenerator itself does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing relations, so it is not a hub."
