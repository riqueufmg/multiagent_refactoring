    "justification": "CompilationUnitMetaModel has only a single outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and only two incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; the provided data shows neither side has a large number of connections."
