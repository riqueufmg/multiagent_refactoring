    "justification": "Hub-like modularization is not detected because RangedList has a small number of direct relationships. Outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.TokenRange, com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList, com.github.javaparser.JavaToken (3 direct dependencies). Incoming dependencies: only com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParser references RangedList (1 incoming). Although some of those related classes (e.g., NodeList, JavaToken) themselves depend on many types, RangedList itself does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies required for a hub-like smell."
