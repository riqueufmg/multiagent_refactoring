    "detection": true,
    "justification": "BoundSet exhibits hub-like modularization: it has a high fan-out (19 outgoing dependencies) to many abstractions such as InferenceVariable, TypeHelper, InstantiationSet, Bound, Substitution, ConstraintFormulaSet, TypeSameAsType, TypeSubtypeOfType, various bounds (SubtypeOfBound, CapturesBound, SameAsBound), Pair, and others; and a high fan-in (12 incoming dependencies) where many other classes depend on it, including TypeInference, ConstraintFormulaSet, ConstraintFormula, ConstraintFormula.ReductionResult, InstantiationSet, and multiple constraint-formula classes (ExpressionCompatibleWithType, TypeSubtypeOfType, TypeSameAsType, TypeCompatibleWithType, TypeContainedByType, LambdaThrowsCompatibleWithType, MethodReferenceThrowsCompatibleWithType). The combination of many incoming and outgoing relationships makes BoundSet a central hub between many abstractions."
