    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.NodeGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NodeGenerator has 0 incoming dependencies and 7 outgoing dependencies (BaseNodeMetaModel, CompilationUnit, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, JavaParserMetaModel, Pair, SourceRoot). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing connections. Because incoming_dependencies is empty (no incoming links) and the number of direct outgoing dependencies is limited (7), NodeGenerator does not meet the 'both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions' condition. Note: some outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, but per the isolation constraint those transitive/delegate counts do not change NodeGenerator's lack of incoming dependencies."
