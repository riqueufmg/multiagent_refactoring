    "justification": "Incoming dependencies: 0 (no classes depend on japa.bdd.samples.JavaConcepts). Outgoing dependencies: 3 — com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit, japa.bdd.samples.JavaConcepts.A, japa.bdd.samples.JavaConcepts.QWE. Although com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit itself references many types, JavaConcepts has only a single direct dependency on that type and only two additional direct internal dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming = 0 and outgoing is small, so the smell is not detected."
