    "detection": true,
    "justification": "NodeText has a high number of incoming and outgoing connections: incoming dependencies from at least 8 distinct classes (LexicalDifferenceCalculator, DifferenceElementCalculator, LexicalPreservingPrinter, Difference, TextElementIteratorsFactory, ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor, DefaultLexicalPreservingPrinter, ChildTextElement) and outgoing dependencies to 4 distinct abstractions (TextElementMatchers, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, TextElementMatcher, TextElement). The incoming callers include core lexical-preservation components (e.g., LexicalPreservingPrinter, LexicalDifferenceCalculator, Difference) while the outgoing edges link to AST Node and multiple text-related types, indicating NodeText functions as a central connector between many modules — a characteristic hub-like modularization smell."
