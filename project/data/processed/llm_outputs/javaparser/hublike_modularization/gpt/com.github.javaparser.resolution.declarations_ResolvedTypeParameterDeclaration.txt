    "justification": "Although ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration has a very large number of incoming dependencies (31 distinct classes in the provided data — e.g. MethodDeclarationCommonLogic, ReflectionClassDeclaration, JavaParserTypeParameter, MethodUsage, LazyType, ReferenceTypeImpl, TypeInference, InferenceContext, MethodResolutionLogic), its outgoing dependency set is small (3 classes: com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedReferenceType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeParametrizable, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions; here the fan-in is large but the fan-out is limited, so the smell is not detected."
