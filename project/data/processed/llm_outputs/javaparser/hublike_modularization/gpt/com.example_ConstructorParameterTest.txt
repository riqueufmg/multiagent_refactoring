    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.quality.Preconditions) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition, so the smell is not detected."
