    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SameAsBound has only 3 outgoing dependencies (InferenceVariableSubstitution, TypeHelper, ResolvedType) and only 1 incoming dependency (BoundSet). The class does not have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, so it does not meet the Hub-like Modularization smell criteria."
