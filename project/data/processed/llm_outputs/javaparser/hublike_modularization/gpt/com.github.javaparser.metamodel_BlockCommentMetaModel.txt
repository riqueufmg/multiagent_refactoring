    "justification": "BlockCommentMetaModel has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has only two incoming dependents (BlockComment and JavaParserMetaModel). Although JavaParserMetaModel itself references many meta-model classes, BlockCommentMetaModel does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections required for Hub-like Modularization."
