    "justification": "ReferenceTypeMetaModel has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (from com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ReferenceType and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here outgoing = 0 and incoming is small, so it is not a hub."
