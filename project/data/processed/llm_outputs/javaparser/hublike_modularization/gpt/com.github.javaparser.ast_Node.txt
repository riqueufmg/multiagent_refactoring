    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Node",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has both a large set of outgoing dependencies and a very large set of incoming dependencies, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell. Outgoing dependencies (explicit in the analyzed_package) include many unrelated abstractions such as com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitor, com.github.javaparser.Position, com.github.javaparser.printer.Printer, com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.Comment, com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel, com.github.javaparser.TokenRange, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty, com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList, com.github.javaparser.resolution.SymbolResolver, com.github.javaparser.Range, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node.Parsedness and others (24 distinct outgoing entries). Incoming dependencies show that dozens of other classes across many packages depend on Node (for example com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.JavaSymbolSolver, many symbolsolver.* classes, com.github.javaparser.ast.type.* classes such as UnionType, ArrayType, TypeParameter, ClassOrInterfaceType, many ast.body.* classes like MethodDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, VariableDeclarator, numerous ast.stmt.* classes, many visitor implementations, printers, lexical-preservation and serialization components, observers and validators). Because Node both depends on many other abstractions and is depended upon by a very large number of other abstractions across the codebase, it functions as a central hub and therefore exhibits Hub-like Modularization."
