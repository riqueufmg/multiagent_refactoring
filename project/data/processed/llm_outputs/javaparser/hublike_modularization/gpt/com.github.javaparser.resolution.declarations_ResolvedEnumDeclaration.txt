    "justification": "ResolvedEnumDeclaration has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedEnumConstantDeclaration) and 4 incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.JavaSymbolSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.FieldAccessContext, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.EnumDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeDeclaration). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections; here the outgoing coupling is minimal and the incoming references (4 callers) are not a 'large number', so the class is not a hub."
