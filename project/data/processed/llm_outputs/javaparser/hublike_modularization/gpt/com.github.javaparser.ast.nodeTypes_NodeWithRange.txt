    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NodeWithRange has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two direct outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.Range and com.github.javaparser.ast.Node. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing links; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 2. Although the outgoing target com.github.javaparser.ast.Node itself lists many dependencies, those are transitive and, per the constraint to analyze the class in isolation, do not make NodeWithRange a hub."
