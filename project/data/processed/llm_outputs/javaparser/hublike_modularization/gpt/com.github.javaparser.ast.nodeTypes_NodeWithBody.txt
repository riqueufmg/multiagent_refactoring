    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithBody",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NodeWithBody has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.BlockStmt, com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.Statement) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing targets themselves reference many other classes (BlockStmt -> 9 dependencies; Statement -> 26 dependencies), NodeWithBody in isolation does not exhibit a large number of incoming dependencies, so it is not a hub."
