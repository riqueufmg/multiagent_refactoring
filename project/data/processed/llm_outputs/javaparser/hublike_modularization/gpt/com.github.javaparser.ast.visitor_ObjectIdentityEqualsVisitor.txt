    "justification": "Although the class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (105 distinct other abstractions, e.g. com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.UnaryExpr, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit), it has zero incoming dependencies in the provided data. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires both many incoming and many outgoing connections; here incoming dependencies = 0, so the smell is not detected."
