    "justification": "NodeWithExtends has a small number of outgoing dependencies (3: com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ClassOrInterfaceType, com.github.javaparser.StaticJavaParser, com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList) and only one incoming dependency (1: com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.JavaParserTypeDeclarationAdapter). It therefore does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in both directions and does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
