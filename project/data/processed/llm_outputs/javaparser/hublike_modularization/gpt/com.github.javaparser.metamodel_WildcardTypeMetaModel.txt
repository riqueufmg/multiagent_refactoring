    "detection": false,
    "justification": "WildcardTypeMetaModel has only one outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and only two incoming dependents in the provided data (com.github.javaparser.ast.type.WildcardType and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Although JavaParserMetaModel itself references many meta-model classes, that still counts as a single incoming abstraction. Because both the number of distinct incoming and outgoing dependencies for WildcardTypeMetaModel are low, it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
