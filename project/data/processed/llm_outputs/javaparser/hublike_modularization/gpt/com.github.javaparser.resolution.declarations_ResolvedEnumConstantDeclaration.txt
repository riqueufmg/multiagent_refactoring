    "justification": "ResolvedEnumConstantDeclaration has multiple incoming dependencies (5 distinct dependents: com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.JavaSymbolSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionEnumDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.EnumConstantDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedEnumDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedDeclaration) but has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing count is zero, so the hub-like smell is not present."
