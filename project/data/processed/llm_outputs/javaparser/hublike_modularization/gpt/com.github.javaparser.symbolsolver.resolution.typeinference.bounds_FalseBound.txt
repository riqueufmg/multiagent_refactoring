    "detection": false,
    "justification": "FalseBound has only one outgoing dependency (InferenceVariableSubstitution) and only one incoming dependent class (Bound). The total number of distinct incoming and outgoing abstraction dependencies is very small (1 outgoing, 1 incoming), so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
