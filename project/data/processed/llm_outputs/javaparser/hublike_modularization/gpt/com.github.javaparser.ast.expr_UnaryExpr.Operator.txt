    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.UnaryExpr) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although the incoming class (com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.UnaryExpr) references many other types, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit multiple incoming/outgoing connections, so the smell is not detected."
