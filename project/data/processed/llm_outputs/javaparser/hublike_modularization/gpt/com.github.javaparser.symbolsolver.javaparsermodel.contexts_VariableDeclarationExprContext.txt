    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver (outgoing deps: 3), com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.VariableDeclarationExpr (outgoing deps: 12), and com.github.javaparser.ast.Node (outgoing deps: 24). Because there are no incoming dependencies and the incoming degree is zero, the class does not meet the requirement of having many dependencies in both directions and therefore is not a hub."
