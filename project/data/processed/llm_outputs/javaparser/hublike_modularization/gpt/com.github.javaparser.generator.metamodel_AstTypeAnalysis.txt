    "justification": "AstTypeAnalysis has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependents (NodeMetaModelGenerator, InitializePropertyMetaModelsStatementsGenerator). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; AstTypeAnalysis lacks outgoing dependencies and has a small number of incoming dependents, so it does not qualify."
