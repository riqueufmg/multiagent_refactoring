    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. CsmTextBlock has outgoing dependencies to three abstractions: com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty, and com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, but it has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). With only 3 outgoing and 0 incoming relationships, it does not meet the 'hub' condition of having a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
