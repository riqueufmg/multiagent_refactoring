    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 incoming dependencies and 6 direct outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.AccessSpecifier, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedParameterDeclaration, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.ast.body.ConstructorDeclaration). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although one outgoing dependency (JavaParserFacade) itself lists many transitive dependencies, the analysis must consider the class in isolation and only direct incoming/outgoing links count; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 6, so the hub smell is not present."
