    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing); this class does not meet that criterion."
