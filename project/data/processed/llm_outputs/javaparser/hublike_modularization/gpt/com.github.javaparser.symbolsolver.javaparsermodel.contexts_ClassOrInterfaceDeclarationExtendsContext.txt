    "justification": "Not a hub: the analyzed class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only three outgoing dependencies (SymbolReference, TypeSolver, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class lacks incoming dependencies and therefore does not meet the criterion."
