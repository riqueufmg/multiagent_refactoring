    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.constraintformulas.TypeContainedByType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeContainedByType has 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeHelper, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType) and 0 incoming dependencies. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Here the analyzed class is linked directly to only three other abstractions and has no incoming links, so it does not meet the criterion for a hub. (Note: the three target classes themselves show many dependencies, but that does not make the analyzed class a hub since its own incoming/outgoing degree is low.)"
