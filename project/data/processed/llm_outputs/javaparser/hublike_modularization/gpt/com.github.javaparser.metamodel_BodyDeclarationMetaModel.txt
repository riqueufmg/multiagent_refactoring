    "justification": "BodyDeclarationMetaModel has a low outgoing dependency set (1 outgoing: com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and a small incoming set (2 incoming references in the provided data: com.github.javaparser.ast.body.BodyDeclaration and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Because it does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, it does not qualify as a hub-like modularization smell."
