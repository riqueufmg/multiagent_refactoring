    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (≈15 distinct types such as TypeSolver, ResolvedTypeDeclaration, SymbolReference, ResolvedReferenceType, JavaParserFacade, AstResolutionUtils, ResolvedType, Context, ObjectCreationExpr, AccessSpecifier, ObjectCreationContext, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceType, JavaParserFactory) but only two incoming dependents are listed (JavaParserFacade and AnonymousClassDeclarationContext). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions. Because incoming coupling is low (2) despite multiple outgoing links, this class does not meet the criterion for a hub-like module."
