    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AcceptGenerator has 0 incoming dependencies and 6 outgoing dependencies (StaticJavaParser, BaseNodeMetaModel, CompilationUnit, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, SourceRoot). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. In isolation, AcceptGenerator does not exhibit a large number of incoming dependencies and its outgoing count (6) is not indicative of a hub, so the smell is not detected."
