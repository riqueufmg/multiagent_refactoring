    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Java11Validator has only one outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator) and no incoming dependencies. The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows neither a large number of outgoing dependencies nor any incoming dependencies. While Validator itself depends on ProblemReporter and Node, those are indirect and do not make Java11Validator a hub."
