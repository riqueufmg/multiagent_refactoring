    "detection": false,
    "justification": "AbstractTypeDeclaration is referenced by a relatively large number of other abstractions (6 incoming): com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionMethodDeclaration, ReflectionClassDeclaration, ReflectionFactory, ReflectionEnumDeclaration, ReflectionRecordDeclaration, and ReflectionConstructorDeclaration. However, it has only a single outgoing dependency in the provided data: com.github.javaparser.resolution.MethodUsage (1 outgoing). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Because AbstractTypeDeclaration shows many incoming but only one outgoing dependency (incoming = 6, outgoing = 1), it does not meet the 'both many incoming and many outgoing' criterion and therefore is not detected as a hub."
