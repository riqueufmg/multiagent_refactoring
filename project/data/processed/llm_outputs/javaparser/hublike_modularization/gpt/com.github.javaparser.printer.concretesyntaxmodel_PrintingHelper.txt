    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.PrintingHelper",

    "justification": "PrintingHelper has 0 outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only 2 incoming dependencies (from com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmAttribute and com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmList). Both incoming entries list PrintingHelper among a small set of dependencies, so the class does not exhibit the high number of both incoming and outgoing connections required for Hub-like Modularization (incoming=2, outgoing=0)."
