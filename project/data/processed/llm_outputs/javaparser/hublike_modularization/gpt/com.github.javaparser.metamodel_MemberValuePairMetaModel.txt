    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.MemberValuePairMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MemberValuePairMetaModel has a very small number of direct dependencies: one outgoing dependency to com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel, and only two incoming dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MemberValuePair and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Hub-like Modularization is characterized by an abstraction having incoming and outgoing relationships with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low incoming (2) and low outgoing (1) counts, so this class is not a hub. Note: although JavaParserMetaModel itself references many meta-model classes, that constitutes a single incoming dependency to MemberValuePairMetaModel in the given data and does not make MemberValuePairMetaModel a hub."
