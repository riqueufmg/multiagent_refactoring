    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem.ReferenceTypeImpl, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies; because incoming_dependencies is empty and outgoing count is small, the smell is not detected. (Note: the outgoing targets themselves depend on many classes, but the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like connectivity.)"
