    "justification": "ResolvedWildcard.BoundType has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedWildcard). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing links); the provided data shows minimal connections, so the smell is not present."
