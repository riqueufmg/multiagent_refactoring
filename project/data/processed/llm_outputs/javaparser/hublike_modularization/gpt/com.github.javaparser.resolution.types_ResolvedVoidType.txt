    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedVoidType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ResolvedVoidType has multiple incoming dependencies (used by ReflectionFactory, TypeExtractor, JavassistFactory, JavassistUtils, and VoidType) but only a single outgoing dependency (depends on com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many both incoming and outgoing ties; here the outgoing dependencies are minimal (one), so ResolvedVoidType is not a hub."
