    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ListReplacementChange has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = 0) and only four direct outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.changes.NoChange, com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty, and com.github.javaparser.ast.Node. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing links; here incoming = 0 and outgoing = 4, so it does not qualify as a hub. (While some of those outgoing classes themselves have many dependencies, the analysis is constrained to the class in isolation.)"
