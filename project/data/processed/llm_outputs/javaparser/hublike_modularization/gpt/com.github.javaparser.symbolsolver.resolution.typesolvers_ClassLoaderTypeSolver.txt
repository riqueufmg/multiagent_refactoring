    "justification": "ClassLoaderTypeSolver has 4 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils.ModuleLayerHelper, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionFactory) and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.TypeSolverBuilder). Both the number of incoming (1) and outgoing (4) relationships are low and do not indicate an abstraction acting as a hub with many incoming and outgoing connections, so Hub-like Modularization is not detected."
