    "justification": "CsmComment has only 3 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.Comment, com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node) and a single incoming dependency (com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmOrphanCommentsEnding). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the provided counts are low, so the smell is not detected."
