    "justification": "ExpressionMetaModel has many incoming dependencies (e.g., referenced by com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression which lists ExpressionMetaModel among its dependencies, and by com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel which also lists ExpressionMetaModel among many meta-model dependencies), but it has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; since outgoing dependencies are absent, the smell is not detected."
