    "justification": "PropertyMetaModel has a very large number of incoming dependencies (~99 distinct classes depend on it, e.g. PackageDeclarationMetaModel, ImportDeclarationMetaModel, JavaParserMetaModel, JavaParserJsonDeserializer, PropertyGenerator, ModifierVisitorGenerator, RemoveMethodGenerator, ReplaceMethodGenerator), but a small number of outgoing dependencies (3: com.github.javaparser.utils.CodeGenerationUtils, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BaseNodeMetaModel). The definition of Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Because PropertyMetaModel has many incoming but only few outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the definition and is not classified as hub-like."
