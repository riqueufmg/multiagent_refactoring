    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ResolvedInterfaceDeclaration has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 5 incoming dependencies (ReflectionInterfaceDeclaration, JavaParserInterfaceDeclaration, TypeInference, JavassistInterfaceDeclaration, ResolvedTypeDeclaration). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; here the lack of outgoing dependencies and the small number of incoming dependents means the class is not a hub."
