    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ThrowsBound has outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.InferenceVariableSubstitution, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.InferenceVariable) and only 1 incoming dependency from a single abstraction (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeInference). Although TypeInference has many dependencies overall, ThrowsBound itself does not have a large number of distinct incoming and outgoing relationships, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
