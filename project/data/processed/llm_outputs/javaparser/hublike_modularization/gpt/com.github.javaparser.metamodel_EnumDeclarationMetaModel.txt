    "justification": "EnumDeclarationMetaModel has only 1 outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and only 2 incoming dependents (com.github.javaparser.ast.body.EnumDeclaration and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the counts here are small and do not indicate a hub."
