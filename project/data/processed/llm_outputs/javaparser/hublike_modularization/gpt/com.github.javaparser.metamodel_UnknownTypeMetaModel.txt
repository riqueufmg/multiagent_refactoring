    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies for this class are empty. Incoming dependencies list only two classes: com.github.javaparser.ast.type.UnknownType and com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing = 0 and incoming = 2, so the class is not a hub. (Although JavaParserMetaModel itself lists many dependencies, those are its outgoing links and do not make UnknownTypeMetaModel have many incoming/outgoing dependencies in the provided, class-isolated data.)"
