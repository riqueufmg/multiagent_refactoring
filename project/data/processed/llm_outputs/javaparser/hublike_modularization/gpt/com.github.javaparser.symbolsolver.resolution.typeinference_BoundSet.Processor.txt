    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies for this class are empty (no outgoing edges). There is a single incoming dependency entry (from com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet). Although BoundSet's dependency list references many types, BoundSet.Processor itself has only one incoming relationship and zero outgoing relationships in the provided data, so it does not exhibit a hub-like pattern of having many incoming and outgoing dependencies."
