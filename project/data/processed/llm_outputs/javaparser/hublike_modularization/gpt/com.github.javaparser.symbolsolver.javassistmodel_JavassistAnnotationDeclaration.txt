    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only four direct outgoing dependencies (ResolvedType, TypeSolver, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter). Although those outgoing targets themselves depend on multiple other abstractions, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships required for a hub-like modularization smell."
