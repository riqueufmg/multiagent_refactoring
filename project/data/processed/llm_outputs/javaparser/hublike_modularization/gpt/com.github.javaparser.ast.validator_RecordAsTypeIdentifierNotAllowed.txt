    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 abstractions (com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Name, com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.ProblemReporter, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.SimpleName) but has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Since there are no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only a small number of outgoing dependencies, this class does not exhibit the Hub-like Modularization smell."
