    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java17Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Java17Validator has 0 incoming dependencies and only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator and com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Because this class has no incoming dependencies and a very small number of outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module. Note: although ParserConfiguration (one outgoing target) has many dependencies itself, the analysis is limited to the examined class in isolation and therefore only the Java17Validator's direct incoming/outgoing counts are relevant."
