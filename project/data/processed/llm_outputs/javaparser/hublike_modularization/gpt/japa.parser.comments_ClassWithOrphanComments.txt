    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and 0 incoming dependencies (both outgoing_dependencies and incoming_dependencies are empty). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class has none, so the smell is not detected."
