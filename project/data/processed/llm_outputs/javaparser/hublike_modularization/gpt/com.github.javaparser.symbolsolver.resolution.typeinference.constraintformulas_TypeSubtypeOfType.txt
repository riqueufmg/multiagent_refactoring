    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.constraintformulas.TypeSubtypeOfType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeSubtypeOfType has a small set of outgoing dependencies (4): com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeHelper, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType. It has a single incoming dependency listed (1): com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet (which references TypeSubtypeOfType). Although some of its neighbor classes (e.g., TypeHelper, BoundSet) have many dependencies, the class itself shows low fan-out (4) and low fan-in (1). Under the provided, isolated data this does not meet the criterion of having large numbers of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub-like modularization."
