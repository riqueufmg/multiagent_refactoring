    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.VisitorValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "VisitorValidator has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only two outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.ProblemReporter and com.github.javaparser.ast.Node. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Because incoming dependencies = 0 and outgoing dependencies = 2 (only two distinct abstractions), VisitorValidator does not meet the hub-like criteria. Note: the many dependencies listed for com.github.javaparser.ast.Node are dependencies of Node itself and do not increase VisitorValidator's incoming/outgoing connectivity."
