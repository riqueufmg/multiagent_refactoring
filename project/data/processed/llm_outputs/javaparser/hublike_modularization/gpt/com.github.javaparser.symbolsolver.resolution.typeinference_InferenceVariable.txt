    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.InferenceVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "InferenceVariable has many incoming dependencies (10 distinct clients: Bound, TypeInference, Instantiation, BoundSet, BoundSet.VariableDependency, InferenceVariableSubstitution, ProperLowerBound, ProperUpperBound, ExpressionCompatibleWithType, ThrowsBound) but only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration and com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing fan-out is very small, so the class is not a hub."
