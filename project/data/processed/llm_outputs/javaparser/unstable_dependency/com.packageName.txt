  "justification": "com.packageName has Ce=0 (no outgoing dependencies) and Ca=1 (one incoming dependency from (default package) with Ce=2, Ca=0). Its stability I = Ca/(Ca+Ce) = 1.0 (highly stable). The Unstable Dependency smell requires the package to depend on less stable packages, but com.packageName has no outgoing dependencies to less stable components; instead an unstable (default package) depends on it. Therefore the smell is not present."
