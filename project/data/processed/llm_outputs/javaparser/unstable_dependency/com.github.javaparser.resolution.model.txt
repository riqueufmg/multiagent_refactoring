"detection": true,
"justification": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.model has Ce=2 and Ca=14 => instability I=2/(2+14)=0.125 (stable). Its outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.resolution.types (Ce=6, Ca=23 => I=6/(6+23)=0.207) and com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations (Ce=3, Ca=25 => I=3/(3+25)=0.107). The dependency to com.github.javaparser.resolution.types is to a less stable package (I=0.207 > 0.125), violating the Stable Dependencies Principle and constituting an Unstable Dependency smell. The dependency to com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations (I=0.107 < 0.125) is acceptable. Additionally, the analyzed package has many incoming dependents (Ca=14 and multiple packages depend on it), reinforcing that it is relatively stable and should not depend on less stable packages."
