Outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser (Ce=16, Ca=38 => I = 16/54 = 0.296) and com.github.javaparser.ast.type (Ce=17, Ca=23 => I = 17/40 = 0.425). Both outgoing dependencies have lower instability (0.296 and 0.425) than the analyzed package (0.667), so the package depends on more stable packages. Incoming dependency from com.github.javaparser exists but does not create an unstable-dependency violation for this package. Therefore the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated and the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
