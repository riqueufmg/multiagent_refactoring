"detection": false,
"justification": "The analyzed package has Ce=0 and Ca=1 -> stability I = 1.0 (fully stable). It has no outgoing dependencies (Ce=0), so it does not depend on any other packages, and therefore cannot depend on less-stable packages. There is one incoming dependency from com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel (Ce=17, Ca=7 -> stability ≈0.29), i.e. a less-stable package depends on this stable package. Since the smell arises when a package depends on less-stable packages and this package has no outgoing dependencies to less-stable components, the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
