"justification": "Analyzed package instability I = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 2/(2+5) = 0.2857. Outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.ast I = 14/(14+44) = 0.2414 and com.github.javaparser.utils I = 10/(10+35) = 0.2222 — both are more stable than the analyzed package (no violation on outgoing edges). However, incoming dependency com.github.javaparser.ast (I = 0.2414) depends on com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration (I = 0.2857). That means a more stable package depends on a less stable one, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle (dependencies should point toward more stable packages). This incoming edge constitutes an unstable dependency smell."
