"package": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.cache",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has Ce=0 (no outgoing dependencies) and Ca=2 (two incoming dependencies), resulting in instability I = 0/(0+2) = 0 (completely stable). Outgoing dependencies list is empty, so it does not depend on any less-stable packages. It is depended upon by com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.cache and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers, which means dependencies flow toward this stable package, conforming to the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
