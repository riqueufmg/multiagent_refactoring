"justification": "Ce = 0 (no outgoing dependencies) and Ca = 0 (no incoming dependencies). The package has an empty list of outgoing_dependencies and incoming_dependencies, so it does not depend on any less-stable packages and cannot violate the Stable Dependencies Principle; therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
