"package": "foo.bar.differentpackage",
"detection": false,
"justification": "foo.bar.differentpackage has Ce=1 and Ca=0 (instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 1/(0+1) = 1.0). Its outgoing dependency is foo.bar which has Ce=0 and Ca=1 (instability I = 0/(1+0) = 0.0). The package therefore depends on a more stable package (0.0 < 1.0), which satisfies the Stable Dependencies Principle. There are no incoming dependencies affecting its stability. Hence no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
