"justification": "The package has Ce=0 (no efferent/outgoing dependencies) and outgoing_dependencies is empty, so it does not depend on any other package. Incoming dependencies Ca=0 and incoming_dependencies is empty indicate it has no dependents either. Because there are no outgoing dependencies, there is no possibility of depending on less stable packages, so the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
