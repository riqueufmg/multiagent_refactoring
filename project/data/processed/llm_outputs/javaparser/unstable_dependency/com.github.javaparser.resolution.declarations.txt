  "justification": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations has Ce=3 and Ca=25 (instability I = 3/(25+3) ≈ 0.107). Its outgoing dependencies are: com.github.javaparser.ast (Ce=14, Ca=44, I = 14/(14+44) ≈ 0.241), com.github.javaparser.resolution.types (Ce=6, Ca=23, I = 6/(6+23) ≈ 0.207), and com.github.javaparser.ast.expr (Ce=14, Ca=31, I = 14/(14+31) ≈ 0.311). All three outgoing dependencies have higher instability than the analyzed package (their I > 0.107), so the package depends on less stable packages and violates the Stable Dependencies Principle — therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
