"justification": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core has Ce=2 and Ca=0 (instability I = 2/(0+2) = 1.0) and outgoing dependencies to com.github.javaparser.utils (Ce=10, Ca=35, I = 10/45 ≈ 0.222) and com.github.javaparser (Ce=16, Ca=38, I = 16/54 ≈ 0.296). Both dependent packages are substantially more stable (lower instability) than the analyzed package, and there are no incoming dependencies to com.github.javaparser.generator.core. Therefore the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated and the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
