"justification": "The package has instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 11/(12+11) = 0.478. It has outgoing dependencies to packages with higher instability: com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor (I = 11/(11+11) = 0.50) and com.github.javaparser.javadoc (I = 5/(5+5) = 0.50). Because com.github.javaparser.ast.comments depends on these less stable (higher-I) packages, it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle and exhibits the Unstable Dependency smell."
