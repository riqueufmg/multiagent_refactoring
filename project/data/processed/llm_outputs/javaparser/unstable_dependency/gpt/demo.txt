"package": "demo",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'demo' has Ce=1 and Ca=0 (instability I = 1.0). Its only outgoing dependency is 'com.github.javaparser.utils' which has Ce=10 and Ca=35 (instability I ≈ 0.222). Because 'demo' depends on a more stable package (lower instability), the Stable Dependency Principle is not violated. There are no incoming dependencies to 'demo' that would alter this assessment, so no unstable dependency smell is detected."
