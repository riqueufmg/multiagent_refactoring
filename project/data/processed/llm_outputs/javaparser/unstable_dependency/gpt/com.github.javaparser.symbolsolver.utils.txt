"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=3, Ca=1 -> Instability I = 3/(3+1) = 0.75. Outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers (Ce=14, Ca=13 -> I ≈ 0.519), com.github.javaparser.utils (Ce=10, Ca=35 -> I ≈ 0.222), com.github.javaparser (Ce=16, Ca=38 -> I ≈ 0.296). All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than the analyzed package (0.75), so the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated. Incoming dependency listed (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers, I ≈ 0.519) is also more stable than the analyzed package. Therefore there is no Unstable Dependency smell for this package."
