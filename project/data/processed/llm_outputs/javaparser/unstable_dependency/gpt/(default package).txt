"justification": "The (default package) has Ce=2 and Ca=0 (stability I=0) and no incoming dependencies. Its outgoing dependencies are com.github.javaparser.quality (Ca=3, Ce=0, stability I=1) and com.packageName (Ca=1, Ce=0, stability I=1). Because the package depends on more stable packages (higher Ca and I) rather than less stable ones, the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
