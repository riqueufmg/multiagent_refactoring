"package": "com.foo",

"justification": "com.foo has Ce=5 and Ca=0 (stability I = 0.00). All outgoing dependencies are more stable than com.foo: com.github.javaparser.ast.body (Ca=29, Ce=12, I≈0.707), com.github.javaparser (Ca=38, Ce=16, I≈0.704), com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers (Ca=13, Ce=14, I≈0.482), com.github.javaparser.ast (Ca=44, Ce=14, I≈0.759), com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel (Ca=10, Ce=24, I≈0.294). Because com.foo depends only on packages with higher stability values, it does not violate the Stable Dependency Principle and therefore does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell. Additionally, com.foo has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0)."
