"package": "bar",
"detection": false,
"justification": "Package 'bar' has no outgoing dependencies (Ce=0) and no incoming dependencies (Ca=0); both outgoing_dependencies and incoming_dependencies lists are empty, so it does not depend on any less-stable package and therefore does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
