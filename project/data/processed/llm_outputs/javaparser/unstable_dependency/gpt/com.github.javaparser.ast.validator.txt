"package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has Ce=6 and Ca=3, giving instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 6/9 = 0.6667. One of its outgoing dependencies, com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations, has Ce=3 and Ca=1, instability I = 3/4 = 0.75, which is less stable (higher instability) than com.github.javaparser.ast.validator. Because com.github.javaparser.ast.validator depends on a package (language_level_validations) that is more unstable than itself, the Stable Dependencies Principle is violated. Other outgoing dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.expr I≈0.311, com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes I≈0.555, com.github.javaparser I≈0.296, com.github.javaparser.ast.type I≈0.425, com.github.javaparser.ast I≈0.241) are more stable, but the single dependency to a less stable package is sufficient to classify this package as having an Unstable Dependency smell. Incoming coupling (Ca=3) shows some clients depend on this package, reinforcing that depending on a less stable package is undesirable."
