"justification": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.logic has Ce=6 and Ca=6 => instability I = 6/(6+6) = 0.5000. It has an outgoing dependency to com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers which has Ce=14 and Ca=13 => instability I = 14/(14+13) = 0.5185, which is more unstable than 0.5000, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. All other outgoing dependencies are more stable (com.github.javaparser.resolution I=0.2727, com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem I=0.2632, com.github.javaparser.resolution.types I=0.2069, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations I=0.1071, com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic I=0.3571), so the presence of the dependency to com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers constitutes an unstable dependency smell."
