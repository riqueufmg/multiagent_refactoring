"package": "another",
"detection": false,
"justification": "Package 'another' has Ce = 0 and Ca = 0, with no outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. Because it does not depend on any other packages (outgoing dependencies = 0), it cannot depend on less stable components; therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
