"justification": "The analyzed package has Ce=4 and Ca=0, giving instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 4/(0+4) = 1.00 (highly unstable). Its outgoing dependencies have instabilities: com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations I = 20/(20+7) = 0.7407, com.github.javaparser.resolution I = 9/(9+24) = 0.2727, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr I = 14/(14+31) = 0.3111, com.github.javaparser.ast.body I = 12/(12+29) = 0.2927. All outgoing packages are more stable (lower instability) than the analyzed package. Although the analyzed package has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0), it does not depend on less stable components, so the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
