"package": "a.b.c",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package a.b.c has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies: []) and no incoming dependencies. Its metrics show Ce=0 and Ca=0, so it does not depend on other packages and cannot depend on less stable packages. Therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
