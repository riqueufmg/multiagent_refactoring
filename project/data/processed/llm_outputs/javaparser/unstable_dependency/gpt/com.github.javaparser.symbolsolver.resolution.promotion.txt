"package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.promotion",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The analyzed package has Ce=3 and Ca=1 (stability I = 1/(1+3) = 0.25), indicating it is relatively unstable. It has three outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.resolution.types (Ce=6, Ca=23, I = 23/(23+6) ≈ 0.793), com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference (Ce=17, Ca=5, I = 5/(5+17) ≈ 0.227), and com.github.javaparser.resolution.promotion (Ce=1, Ca=2, I = 2/(2+1) ≈ 0.667). According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, the package should only depend on packages with higher stability (higher I). One outgoing dependency (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference, I ≈ 0.227) is less stable than the analyzed package (I = 0.25), which is a violation and constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell. The other outgoing dependencies are more stable and do not violate the principle (I ≈ 0.793 and 0.667)."
