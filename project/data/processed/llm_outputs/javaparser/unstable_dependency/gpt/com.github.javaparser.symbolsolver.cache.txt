"package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.cache",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has Ce=1 and Ca=1 (instability I = 1/(1+1) = 0.5). Its only outgoing dependency is com.github.javaparser.resolution.cache (Ce=0, Ca=2, I = 0/(0+2) = 0), i.e., it depends on a more stable package, which complies with the Stable Dependencies Principle. There is an incoming dependency from com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers (Ce=14, Ca=13, I ≈ 0.52), but incoming dependencies do not cause this package to have an unstable dependency. Hence, no unstable dependency smell is detected."
