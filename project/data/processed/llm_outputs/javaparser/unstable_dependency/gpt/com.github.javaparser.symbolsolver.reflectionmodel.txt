"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has Ce=17 and Ca=7 giving instability I = 7/(7+17) ≈ 0.292. It has outgoing dependencies to packages that are less stable (lower I): com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution (Ce=20, Ca=6, I ≈ 0.231) and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts (Ce=21, Ca=5, I ≈ 0.192). Because it depends on these less stable packages, it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle and exhibits the Unstable Dependency smell."
