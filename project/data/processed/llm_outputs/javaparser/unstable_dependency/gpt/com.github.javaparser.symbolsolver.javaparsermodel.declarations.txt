"package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package has instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 20/(20+7) = 0.741 (Ce=20, Ca=7). It has outgoing dependencies to packages that are less stable (higher I) than itself, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. Specifically: com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts has I = 21/(21+5) = 0.808 (Ce=21, Ca=5) and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution has I = 20/(20+6) = 0.769 (Ce=20, Ca=6). Because the analyzed package depends on these more unstable packages, the Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
