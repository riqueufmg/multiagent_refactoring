  "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "The package has Ce=21 and Ca=5, giving instability I = 21/(21+5) = 0.808. The Stable Dependencies Principle requires that a package only depends on packages that are more stable (lower instability). All measured outgoing dependencies have lower instability values than 0.808 — examples: com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference I=17/(17+5)=0.773, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution I=20/(20+6)=0.769, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations I=20/(20+7)=0.741, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel I=17/(17+7)=0.708, com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver I=21/(21+9)=0.700, and core framework packages (e.g. com.github.javaparser I=0.296, com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations I=0.107) are much more stable. Incoming coupling is low (Ca=5) relative to efferent coupling. Since the analyzed package does not depend on any package less stable than itself, the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
