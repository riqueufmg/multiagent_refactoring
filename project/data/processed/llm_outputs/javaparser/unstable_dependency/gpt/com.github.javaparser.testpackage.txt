"package": "com.github.javaparser.testpackage",
"detection": false,
"justification": "No unstable dependency detected because the package has no outgoing dependencies (Ce = 0, dependencies = []). There are also no incoming dependencies (Ca = 0). With Ce = 0 the package does not depend on any other (potentially less stable) packages, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated."
