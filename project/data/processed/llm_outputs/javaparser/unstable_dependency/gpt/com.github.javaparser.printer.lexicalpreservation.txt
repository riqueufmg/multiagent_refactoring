"justification": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation has Ce=16, Ca=3 (stability I = 3/(3+16) = 0.1579). It has an outgoing dependency to com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.changes which has Ce=6, Ca=1 (stability I = 1/(1+6) = 0.1429), i.e. a less stable package (0.1429 < 0.1579). According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should depend only on packages that are more stable (higher I); depending on the 'changes' package (lower I) constitutes an unstable dependency. (All other outgoing dependencies have equal or higher stability than 0.1579.)"
