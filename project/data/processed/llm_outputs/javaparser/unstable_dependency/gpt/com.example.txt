"justification": "com.example has Ce=1 and Ca=0 (instability I = 1.0). It has one outgoing dependency to com.github.javaparser.quality which has Ce=0 and Ca=3 (instability I = 0.0). There are no incoming dependencies to com.example. Because com.example depends on a more stable package (I_com.example > I_dependency) the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected, so no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
