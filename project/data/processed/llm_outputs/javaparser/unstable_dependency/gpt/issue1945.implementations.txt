"justification": "issue1945.implementations has Ce=1 and Ca=0 (stability I = 0/(0+1) = 0). It has an outgoing dependency to issue1945.interfaces, which has Ce=0 and Ca=2 (stability I = 2/(2+0) = 1). The dependency direction is from a less stable package (I=0) to a more stable package (I=1), so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
