"detection": false,
"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=2, Ca=1 => stability I = 1/(1+2) = 0.333. Outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser (Ce=16, Ca=38 => I = 38/(38+16) = 0.704) and com.github.javaparser.ast.type (Ce=17, Ca=23 => I = 23/(23+17) = 0.575). Both outgoing packages have higher stability (0.704 and 0.575) than the analyzed package (0.333), so the package depends on more stable packages. Incoming dependency com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node has Ce=7, Ca=0 (I=0) but this is a client of the analyzed package. Therefore there is no unstable-dependency smell for com.github.javaparser.generator.core.utils."
