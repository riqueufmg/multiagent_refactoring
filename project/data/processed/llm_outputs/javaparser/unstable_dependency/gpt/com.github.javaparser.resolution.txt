"package": "com.github.javaparser.resolution",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package com.github.javaparser.resolution is relatively stable (Ce=9, Ca=24 -> instability I = 9/(9+24) = 0.2727) but it has outgoing dependencies to packages that are less stable (i.e. have higher instability I), violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. Offending outgoing dependencies (their Ce, Ca and instability I): com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.parametrization (Ce=2, Ca=5, I=0.2857), com.github.javaparser.ast.body (Ce=12, Ca=29, I=0.2927), com.github.javaparser.ast.expr (Ce=14, Ca=31, I=0.3111), com.github.javaparser.ast.type (Ce=17, Ca=23, I=0.4250). These four have I > 0.2727, so com.github.javaparser.resolution depends on less stable packages. The package also has many incoming dependencies (Ca=24) reinforcing that it is a stable package that should not depend on less stable ones, confirming the unstable dependency smell."
