"justification": "issue1945.interfaces has Ce=0 and Ca=2 (instability I = 0/(0+2) = 0) and no outgoing dependencies. Both incoming packages (issue1945.implementations: Ce=1, Ca=0; issue1945.main: Ce=1, Ca=0) depend on this package. The dependency direction is from less stable packages (instability 1) to this more stable package, which complies with the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
