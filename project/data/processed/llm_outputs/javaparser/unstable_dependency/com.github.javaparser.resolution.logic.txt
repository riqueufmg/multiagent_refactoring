Outgoing dependencies and their instabilities: com.github.javaparser.resolution (Ce=9, Ca=24, I≈0.273), com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem (Ce=5, Ca=14, I≈0.263), com.github.javaparser.resolution.model (Ce=2, Ca=14, I≈0.125), com.github.javaparser.resolution.types (Ce=6, Ca=23, I≈0.207), com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations (Ce=3, Ca=25, I≈0.107). All outgoing packages have lower instability (are more stable) than com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected. Note: there is a mutual dependency with com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem, but that package is more stable (I≈0.263). Incoming dependents are generally more unstable (examples: symbolsolver.declarations.common I=1.0, reflectionmodel I≈0.708, symbolsolver.javaparsermodel I≈0.706), which indicates the analyzed package is relatively stable and being depended upon by less stable packages. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
