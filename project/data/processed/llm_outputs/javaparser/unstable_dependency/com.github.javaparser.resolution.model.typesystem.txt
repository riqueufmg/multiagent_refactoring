"justification": "The package com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem has Ce=5 and Ca=14 => Instability I = 5/(14+5) = 0.263. It has outgoing dependencies to several packages whose instability is higher (i.e., they are less stable): com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.parametrization (Ce=2, Ca=5 => I=2/7 = 0.286), com.github.javaparser.resolution (Ce=9, Ca=24 => I=9/33 = 0.273), and com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic (Ce=5, Ca=9 => I=5/14 = 0.357). Depending on these packages with I > 0.263 violates the Stable Dependencies Principle (a stable package should only depend on more stable packages). Note also the package has substantial incoming coupling (Ca=14, many incoming dependents), which reinforces that it is relatively stable and thus should not depend on less stable packages. Therefore an Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
