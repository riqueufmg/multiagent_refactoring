"package": "com.github.javaparser.resolution",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.resolution' has outgoing dependencies to packages that are less stable (higher instability index) than itself. For example, it depends on 'com.github.javaparser.ast.body' (I=0.29), 'com.github.javaparser.ast' (I=0.24), 'com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt' (I=0.25), and 'com.github.javaparser.ast.expr' (I=0.31), all of which have lower instability indices compared to 'com.github.javaparser.resolution' (I=0.27). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable (higher instability index) than itself."
