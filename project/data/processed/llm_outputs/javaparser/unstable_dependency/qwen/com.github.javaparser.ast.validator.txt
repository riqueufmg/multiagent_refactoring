"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.ast.validator' has a stability metric (I) of 0.667, calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 6/(3+6). It depends on packages such as 'com.github.javaparser.ast.expr' (I = 0.31), 'com.github.javaparser.ast.type' (I = 0.42), and 'com.github.javaparser' (I = 0.29), which are more stable than itself. However, it also depends on 'com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations' (I = 0.75), which is less stable than itself, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. Additionally, the package 'com.github.javaparser' depends back on 'com.github.javaparser.ast.validator', creating a cyclic dependency that contributes to instability."
