"package": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.model",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.model' has outgoing dependencies on 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.types' and 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations'. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we must evaluate the stability of these dependencies in comparison to the analyzed package. Stability is calculated as Ce / (Ca + Ce), where Ce is efferent couplings and Ca is afferent couplings. For 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.model', stability = 2 / (14 + 2) = 0.125. For 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.types', stability = 6 / (23 + 6) = 0.207. For 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations', stability = 3 / (25 + 3) = 0.107. The analyzed package depends on 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.types', which is more stable (0.207 > 0.125), and 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations', which is less stable (0.107 < 0.125). However, since one of the dependencies is more stable and the other is less stable, and considering that the overall architectural direction does not clearly violate the Stable Dependencies Principle in a significant way, this is not classified as an Unstable Dependency smell."
