"package": "com.example",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.example' has outgoing dependency on 'com.github.javaparser.quality'. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we need to calculate stability metrics. Stability is calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) where Ce is efferent couplings (outgoing dependencies) and Ca is afferent couplings (incoming dependencies). For 'com.example': Ce=1, Ca=0, so stability = 1/(0+1) = 1.0 (completely stable). For 'com.github.javaparser.quality': Ce=0, Ca=3, so stability = 0/(3+0) = 0.0 (completely unstable). Since 'com.example' (stability=1.0) depends on 'com.github.javaparser.quality' (stability=0.0), it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle - a stable package should not depend on an unstable package. However, the analyzed package 'com.example' itself is completely stable (Ce=1, Ca=0), so it does not exhibit unstable dependency smell."
