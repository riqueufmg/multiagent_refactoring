"justification": "The package japa.bdd.samples has outgoing dependency on com.github.javaparser.ast. The stability of japa.bdd.samples is 1.0 (Ce=1, Ca=0), while com.github.javaparser.ast has stability of 0.24 (Ce=14, Ca=44). Since japa.bdd.samples (stability=1.0) depends on com.github.javaparser.ast (stability=0.24), it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle as it depends on a less stable package, which is acceptable. However, this is actually a violation of the principle which states packages should depend on more stable packages. But given that japa.bdd.samples has stability of 1.0 (most unstable), it cannot depend on packages with higher stability since all packages have some level of instability. The justification needs to be corrected: japa.bdd.samples (instability=1.0) depends on com.github.javaparser.ast (instability=0.76), following the principle that unstable packages should depend on more stable ones, but since japa.bdd.samples is maximally unstable (I=1.0), this represents a potential smell. Actually, re-evaluating: japa.bdd.samples has Ce=1, Ca=0, so I=1.0. com.github.javaparser.ast has Ce=14, Ca=44, so I=14/(14+44)=14/58≈0.24. Since japa.bdd.samples (I=1.0) depends on com.github.javaparser.ast (I=0.24), this means an unstable package depends on a more stable package, which is correct according to the Stable Dependencies Principle."
