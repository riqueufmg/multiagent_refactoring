It depends on packages like 'com.github.javaparser.resolution' (I = 0.27), 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations' (I = 0.11), and 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.types' (I = 0.21), which are more stable than itself. However, it also depends on less stable packages such as 'com.github.javaparser.utils' (I = 0.22) and 'com.github.javaparser.printer' (I = 0.62), violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
