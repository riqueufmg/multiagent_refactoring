"package": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration' has a stability metric (I) of 0.286, calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 2/(5+2). Its outgoing dependencies include 'com.github.javaparser.utils' (I=0.222) and 'com.github.javaparser.ast' (I=0.241), both of which are more stable (lower I values) than the analyzed package itself. However, it also has incoming dependencies from packages like 'com.github.javaparser.ast' (I=0.241) and 'com.github.javaparser.printer' (I=0.615), indicating that it is depended upon by both less stable and more stable packages. The Unstable Dependency smell is detected because while it correctly depends on more stable packages, its own instability makes it vulnerable to changes in its dependencies, and it creates a dependency chain where less stable packages (like itself) end up depending on more stable ones, which violates the Stable Dependencies Principle when considering the overall architecture."
