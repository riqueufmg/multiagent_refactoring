"package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.naming",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.naming' has 11 outgoing dependencies and 0 incoming dependencies (Ca=0). To determine if there's an Unstable Dependency, we must evaluate the stability of this package and compare it with the stability of its dependencies. Stability is calculated as Ce / (Ca + Ce). For this package, stability = 11 / (0 + 11) = 1.0, indicating it is maximally unstable. However, since it has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0), it does not depend on any other package in a way that would violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell because it doesn't depend on packages that are less stable than itself; rather, its own instability is at maximum due to having only outgoing dependencies."
