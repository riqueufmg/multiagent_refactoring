{
"package": "(default package)",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package (default package) has instability value of 1.0 (Ce=2, Ca=0, so I/(I+D) = 2/(2+0) = 1.0), making it highly unstable. It depends on com.packageName (instability = 0/(0+1) = 0.0) and com.github.javaparser.quality (instability = 0/(0+3) = 0.0), both of which are completely stable (instability = 0.0). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle as an unstable package should not depend on more stable packages - the dependency direction should go from stable to unstable, not the reverse."
