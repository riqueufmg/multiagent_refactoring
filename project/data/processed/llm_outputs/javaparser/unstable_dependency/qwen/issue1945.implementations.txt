"package": "issue1945.implementations",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'issue1945.implementations' has a dependency on 'issue1945.interfaces'. The stability of 'issue1945.implementations' is 0.25 (Ce=1, Ca=0, so Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 1/1 = 1, but since Ce+Ca=1, stability = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 1/1 = 1.0, however with Ce=1 and Ca=0, it's actually unstable). Let me recalculate: Stability = Ce/(Ce+Ca). For 'issue1945.implementations': Ce=1, Ca=0, so Stability = 1/(1+0) = 1.0 (completely unstable). For 'issue1945.interfaces': Ce=0, Ca=2, so Stability = 0/(0+2) = 0.0 (completely stable). Since the dependent package 'issue1945.implementations' (stability=1.0) depends on a more stable package 'issue1945.interfaces' (stability=0.0), this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and is NOT an unstable dependency."
