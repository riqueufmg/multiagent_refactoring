"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution' has a stability metric (Ca=6, Ce=20) that indicates it is relatively unstable (high efferent coupling). It depends on several other packages including 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel', 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel', and 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers', which are also relatively unstable (high Ce values). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
