"package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.observer",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.ast.observer' has outgoing dependencies on 'com.github.javaparser.utils', 'com.github.javaparser.ast', and 'com.github.javaparser.ast.body'. To determine if there is an unstable dependency, we calculate the stability (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) for each dependency: 'com.github.javaparser.utils' has I = 10/(35+10) = 0.22, 'com.github.javaparser.ast' has I = 14/(44+14) = 0.24, and 'com.github.javaparser.ast.body' has I = 12/(29+12) = 0.29. The analyzed package has I = 3/(12+3) = 0.2. Since the analyzed package is less stable than all its dependencies, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
