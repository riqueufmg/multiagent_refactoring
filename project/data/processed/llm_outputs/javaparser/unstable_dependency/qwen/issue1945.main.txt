"package": "issue1945.main",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'issue1945.main' has an outgoing dependency on 'issue1945.interfaces'. To evaluate stability, we compare the instability values: issue1945.main has Ce=1, Ca=0, so instability = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 1/1 = 1.0. The dependency 'issue1945.interfaces' has Ce=0, Ca=2, so instability = 0/(0+2) = 0.0. Since the dependent package (issue1945.main with instability 1.0) is more unstable than the dependency (issue1945.interfaces with instability 0.0), this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. The more unstable package depends on the more stable package, so there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
