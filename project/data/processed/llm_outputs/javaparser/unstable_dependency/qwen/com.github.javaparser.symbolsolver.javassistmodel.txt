It depends on 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel' (stability = 24/(24+10) = 0.705), 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution' (stability = 20/(20+6) = 0.769), and 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver' (stability = 21/(21+9) = 0.7), all of which have lower stability values, indicating they are less stable. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle."
