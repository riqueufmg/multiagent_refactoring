"package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils",

"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils' has outgoing dependencies to 'com.github.javaparser.utils', 'com.github.javaparser', and 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers'. To determine if there is an unstable dependency, we need to compare the stability (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) of the analyzed package with its dependencies. The analyzed package has Ce=3 and Ca=1, so its instability I=3/(1+3)=0.75. The dependencies have the following instabilities: 'com.github.javaparser.utils' has Ce=10, Ca=35, I=10/(10+35)=0.22; 'com.github.javaparser' has Ce=16, Ca=38, I=16/(16+38)=0.296; 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers' has Ce=14, Ca=13, I=14/(14+13)=0.518. Since the analyzed package (I=0.75) depends only on packages that are more stable (lower I values), it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Note that one of its dependencies is itself ('com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils'), which does not constitute an unstable dependency."
