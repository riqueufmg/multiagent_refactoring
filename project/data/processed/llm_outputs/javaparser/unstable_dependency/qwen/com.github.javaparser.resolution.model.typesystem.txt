"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem' depends on packages that are less stable than itself. Specifically, it depends on 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic' (stability = 0.36) and 'com.github.javaparser.resolution' (stability = 0.27), both of which have lower stability (higher instability) compared to the analyzed package (stability = 0.43). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
