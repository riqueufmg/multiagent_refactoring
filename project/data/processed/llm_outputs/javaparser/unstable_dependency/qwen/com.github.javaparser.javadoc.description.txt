"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.javadoc.description' has a stability metric (I) of 0.8 (Ce=1, Ca=4), making it unstable. It depends on 'com.github.javaparser.utils', which has a stability metric (I) of 0.22 (Ce=10, Ca=35), making it stable. Since the dependency is from an unstable package to a more stable package, this adheres to the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not constitute an Unstable Dependency smell."
