"justification": "The package 'foo.bar.differentpackage' has stability of 0.5 (Ce=1, Ca=0, so Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 1/1 = 1, but since Ce=1 and Ca=0, stability = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 1/(1+0) = 1, however the formula is Ce/(Ce+Ca) when Ce+Ca > 0, so it's 1/1 = 1.0 for outgoing and 0/1 = 0 for incoming perspective, but for stability we use Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 1/(1+0) = 1.0. The dependent package 'foo.bar' has stability of 0 (Ce=0, Ca=1, so 0/(0+1) = 0). Since the dependent package 'foo.bar' (stability=0) is less stable than 'foo.bar.differentpackage' (stability=1.0), this would normally indicate an unstable dependency. However, the package 'foo.bar.differentpackage' has only 1 outgoing dependency and 0 incoming dependencies, making it maximally unstable (instability=1.0) and it depends on a maximally stable package (instability=0), which follows the Stable Dependencies Principle."
