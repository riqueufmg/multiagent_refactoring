"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node' depends on several other packages, some of which are less stable than itself. Stability is calculated as I = Ce / (Ca + Ce), where Ce is efferent couplings and Ca is afferent couplings. For 'com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node', I = 7 / (0 + 7) = 1.0, indicating it is completely unstable. However, it depends on packages like 'com.github.javaparser.utils' (I = 10/45 ≈ 0.22), 'com.github.javaparser.ast' (I = 14/58 ≈ 0.24), and 'com.github.javaparser' (I = 16/54 ≈ 0.30), which are more stable than itself. But it also depends on 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel' (I = 5/18 ≈ 0.28) and others with similar or lower stability. Since the package depends on components that are not strictly more stable than itself, it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, thus constituting an Unstable Dependency smell."
