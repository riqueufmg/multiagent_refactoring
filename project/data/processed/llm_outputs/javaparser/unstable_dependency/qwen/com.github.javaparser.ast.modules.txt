"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.ast.modules' has a stability metric (Ce/(Ce+Ca)) of 6/(6+7) = 0.46. It depends on packages like 'com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor' (stability = 11/(11+11) = 0.5), 'com.github.javaparser.ast' (stability = 14/(14+44) = 0.24), and 'com.github.javaparser' (stability = 16/(16+38) = 0.296). While some dependencies are to less stable packages, it also depends on 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel' (stability = 5/(5+13) = 0.278) and others with similar or slightly higher stability. However, the overall pattern shows dependencies on packages with comparable or only marginally higher stability, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle which requires dependencies to be on significantly more stable packages."
