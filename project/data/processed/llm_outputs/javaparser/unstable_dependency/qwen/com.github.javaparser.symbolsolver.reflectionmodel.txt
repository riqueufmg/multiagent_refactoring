"package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel' has a stability metric (Ce/(Ce+Ca)) of 17/(17+7) = 0.708, indicating it is relatively unstable. It depends on several packages that are more stable or equally stable, such as 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.logic' (stability 0.5), 'com.github.javaparser.utils' (stability 0.222), 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations' (stability 0.107), and others with lower instability values. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, an unstable package should not depend on other less stable packages. However, some of its dependencies like 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution' have high instability (20/(20+6) = 0.769), which violates the principle."
