"justification": "The package 'demo' has outgoing dependency to 'com.github.javaparser.utils'. The stability of 'demo' is 1.0 (Ce=1, Ca=0, I=0/1=0, S=1-0=1). The stability of 'com.github.javaparser.utils' is 0.965 (Ce=10, Ca=35, I=35/45=0.778, S=1-0.778=0.222, but considering only Ce and Ca, Ce/(Ce+Ca)=10/45=0.222, so S=1-0.222=0.778 is incorrect. Actually, S=Ca/(Ca+Ce)=35/45=0.778 for instability, so stability S=1-0.778=0.222. The demo package (S=1.0) depends on a more stable package (S=0.222), which follows the Stable Dependencies Principle."
