"justification": "The package com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.imports has a stability value of 0.25 (Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 1/(1+3) = 0.25). It depends on com.github.javaparser.ast which has a stability value of 0.76 (Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 14/(14+4) = 0.76). Since the analyzed package (0.25) is less stable than the package it depends on (0.76), it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
