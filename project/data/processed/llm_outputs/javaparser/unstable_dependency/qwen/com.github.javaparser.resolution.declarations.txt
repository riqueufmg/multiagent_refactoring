"package": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations' has a stability value (I) of 0.89 (Ce=3, Ca=25; I = Ce / (Ce + Ca) = 3 / (3 + 25) ≈ 0.11, Stability = 1 - I ≈ 0.89). Its outgoing dependencies are: 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.types' (I ≈ 0.21, Stability ≈ 0.79), 'com.github.javaparser.ast' (I ≈ 0.24, Stability ≈ 0.76), and 'com.github.javaparser.ast.expr' (I ≈ 0.31, Stability ≈ 0.69). All these dependencies have lower stability values than the analyzed package, which means the dependencies are in the correct direction according to the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
