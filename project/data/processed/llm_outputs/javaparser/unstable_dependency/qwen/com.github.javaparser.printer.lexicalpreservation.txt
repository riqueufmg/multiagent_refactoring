"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation' depends on several packages that are less stable (higher Ce/(Ce+Ca) ratio) than itself. For example, it depends on 'com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.changes' which has a stability of 0.857 (Ce=6, Ca=1), and 'com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel' with stability of 0.7 (Ce=7, Ca=3), both of which are less stable than the analyzed package's stability of approximately 0.842 (Ce=16, Ca=3). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle."
