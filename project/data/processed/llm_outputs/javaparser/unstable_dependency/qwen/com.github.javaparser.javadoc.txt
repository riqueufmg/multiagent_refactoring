{
"package": "com.github.javaparser.javadoc",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.javadoc' has a stability metric (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) of 0.5, indicating it is neutrally stable. However, it depends on packages like 'com.github.javaparser.utils' (I = 0.22), 'com.github.javaparser.ast' (I = 0.24), and 'com.github.javaparser' (I = 0.29), which are more stable (lower instability values). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Additionally, it depends on 'com.github.javaparser.javadoc.description' (I = 0.2), which is also more stable. Therefore, this constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell."
