"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel' has a stability metric (Ce/(Ce+Ca)) of 24/(24+10) = 0.706. It depends on packages such as 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution' (Ce=20, Ca=6, stability=0.769), 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver' (Ce=21, Ca=9, stability=0.700), and 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel' (Ce=17, Ca=7, stability=0.708). These dependencies have stability values greater than or equal to the analyzed package, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Hence, it exhibits the Unstable Dependency smell."
