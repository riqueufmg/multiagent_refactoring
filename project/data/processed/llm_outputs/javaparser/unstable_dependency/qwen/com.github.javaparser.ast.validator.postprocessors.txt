"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.postprocessors' has an instability value of 0.67 (Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 2/(2+1)), while its outgoing dependency 'com.github.javaparser' has an instability value of 0.29 (Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 16/(16+38)). According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should only depend on packages that are more stable (less unstable) than itself. Since 0.67 > 0.29, this constitutes an unstable dependency."
