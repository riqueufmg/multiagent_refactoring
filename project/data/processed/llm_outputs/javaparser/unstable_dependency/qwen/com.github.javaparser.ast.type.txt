"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.ast.type' has a stability metric (Ca/(Ca+Ce)) of 23/(23+17) = 0.575, indicating it is relatively unstable. It depends on packages like 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.types' (stability = 23/(23+6) = 0.793), 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations' (stability = 25/(25+3) = 0.893), and 'com.github.javaparser.resolution' (stability = 24/(24+9) = 0.727), which are more stable than itself. However, it also depends on less stable packages such as 'com.github.javaparser.utils' (stability = 35/(35+10) = 0.778) and 'com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor' (stability = 11/(11+11) = 0.5), violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
