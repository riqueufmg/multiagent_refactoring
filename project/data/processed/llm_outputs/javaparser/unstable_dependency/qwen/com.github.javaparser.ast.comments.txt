"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.ast.comments' has a stability metric (Ce/(Ce+Ca)) of 11/(11+12) = 0.478. It depends on packages such as 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel' (stability = 5/(5+13) = 0.278), 'com.github.javaparser.utils' (stability = 10/(10+35) = 0.222), and others with lower stability values. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Since this package depends on less stable packages, it exhibits the Unstable Dependency smell."
