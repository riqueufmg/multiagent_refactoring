Specifically, it depends on com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel (stability=0.7) and com.github.javaparser (stability=0.296), both of which have lower stability values than the analyzed package (stability=0.857). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
