It depends on packages such as 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations' (stability = 20/(20+7) ≈ 0.74), 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel' (stability = 24/(24+10) ≈ 0.71), and 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel' (stability = 17/(17+7) ≈ 0.71), which are also unstable or have similar stability. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should depend only on packages that are more stable than itself."
