"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers' has outgoing dependencies on packages that are less stable (higher Ce/(Ce+Ca) ratio) than itself. For example, it depends on 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel' which has a stability of 0.76 (Ce=24, Ca=10), while the analyzed package has a stability of 0.52 (Ce=14, Ca=13). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
