"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.ast.body' has a stability metric (Ce=12, Ca=29) indicating it is relatively unstable (instability = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 12/41 ≈ 0.29). It depends on several other packages, some of which are more stable (e.g., 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel' with Ce=5, Ca=13 → instability ≈ 0.28), but also on less stable ones such as 'com.github.javaparser.utils' (Ce=10, Ca=35 → instability ≈ 0.22) and 'com.github.javaparser.ast.expr' (Ce=14, Ca=31 → instability ≈ 0.31). However, it also depends on packages like 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations' (Ce=3, Ca=25 → instability ≈ 0.11), which is more stable. While not all dependencies violate the Stable Dependencies Principle, the presence of dependencies on less stable packages like 'com.github.javaparser.utils' and 'com.github.javaparser.ast.expr' contributes to the smell of Unstable Dependency."
