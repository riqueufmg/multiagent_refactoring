"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.ast' has a stability value of 0.38, calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 14/(44+14). Among its outgoing dependencies, packages like 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel' (stability 0.28), 'com.github.javaparser.ast.modules' (stability 0.46), and 'com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor' (stability 0.52) have higher or comparable stability. Although some dependencies such as 'com.github.javaparser.utils' (stability 0.22) and 'com.github.javaparser.printer' (stability 0.62) are less stable, the overall architecture does not exhibit a clear violation of the Stable Dependencies Principle, as several key dependencies are more stable. Therefore, no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
