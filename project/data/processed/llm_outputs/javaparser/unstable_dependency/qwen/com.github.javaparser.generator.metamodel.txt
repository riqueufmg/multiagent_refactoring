"package": "com.github.javaparser.generator.metamodel",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.generator.metamodel' has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0), meaning it is unstable (I=1). All its outgoing dependencies are to packages that have higher stability (lower instability) values. For example, 'com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration' has Ca=5 and Ce=2, making it more stable. Similarly, other dependencies like 'com.github.javaparser.ast' and 'com.github.javaparser' also exhibit higher stability. Therefore, the package follows the Stable Dependencies Principle by depending on more stable packages."
