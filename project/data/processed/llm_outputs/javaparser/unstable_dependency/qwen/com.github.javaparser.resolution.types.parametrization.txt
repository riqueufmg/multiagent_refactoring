"package": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.parametrization",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.parametrization' has outgoing dependencies on 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.types' and 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations'. To determine if this is an unstable dependency, we must assess the stability of these dependencies relative to the analyzed package. Stability is calculated as Ce / (Ca + Ce). For the analyzed package, Ca = 5 and Ce = 2, so its stability is 2 / (5 + 2) = 0.29. The dependency 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.types' has Ca = 23 and Ce = 6, giving it a stability of 6 / (23 + 6) = 0.21. The dependency 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations' has Ca = 25 and Ce = 3, giving it a stability of 3 / (25 + 3) = 0.11. Both dependencies have lower stability values than the analyzed package (0.29), meaning the analyzed package depends on more stable packages. Therefore, the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected, and there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
