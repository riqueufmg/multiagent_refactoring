"justification": "The package has a stability metric (I) of 0.25, making it unstable. Its outgoing dependencies are to packages com.github.javaparser.ast (I=0.84), com.github.javaparser (I=0.74), and com.github.javaparser.ast.validator (I=0.67), all of which are more stable than itself. This follows the Stable Dependencies Principle, hence no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
