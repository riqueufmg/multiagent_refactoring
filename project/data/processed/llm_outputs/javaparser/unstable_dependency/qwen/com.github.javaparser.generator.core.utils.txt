"package": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.utils",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.generator.core.utils' has an instability value of 0.67 (Ce=2, Ca=1), while its outgoing dependency 'com.github.javaparser.ast.type' has an instability value of 0.42 (Ce=17, Ca=23) and 'com.github.javaparser' has an instability value of 0.29 (Ce=16, Ca=38). According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, this package should depend on packages that are more stable (lower instability values) than itself, but it depends on packages with lower instability (more stable), which incorrectly satisfies the principle. However, since this package is relatively unstable and depends on more stable packages, there is no unstable dependency smell based on the direction of stability. Correction: The package depends on more stable packages, hence it does NOT violate the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, the detection should be false."
