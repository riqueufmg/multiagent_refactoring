Stability is calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce). For this package, stability is 17/(5+17) = 0.77. It depends on 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel' which has stability 24/(10+24) = 0.71, and 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers' with stability 14/(13+14) = 0.52. Both dependencies have lower stability, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle."
