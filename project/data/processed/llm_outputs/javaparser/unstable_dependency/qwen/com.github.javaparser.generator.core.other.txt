"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.generator.core.other' has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0), meaning it is unstable (I=1). All its outgoing dependencies are to packages that have higher stability (lower I values) or equal instability, thus adhering to the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
