"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations' has outgoing dependencies on packages that are less stable than itself. Stability is calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce). For this package, stability is 20/(7+20) = 0.74. It depends on 'com.github.javaparser.resolution' (stability = 9/(24+9) = 0.27), 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.core.resolution' (stability = 3/(7+3) = 0.3), and others with lower stability values. According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should only depend on packages more stable than itself, which is violated here."
