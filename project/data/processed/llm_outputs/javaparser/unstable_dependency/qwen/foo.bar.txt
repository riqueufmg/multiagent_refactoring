"package": "foo.bar",
"detection": false,
"justification": "Package foo.bar has stability of 1.0 (Ce=0, Ca=1, stability = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 0/1 = 0). It depends on no packages (Ce=0) and is depended upon by foo.bar.differentpackage which has stability of 1.0 (Ce=1, Ca=0, stability = 1/1 = 1.0). Since foo.bar.differentpackage has higher stability (1.0) than foo.bar (0), the dependency direction follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. No unstable dependency smell detected."
