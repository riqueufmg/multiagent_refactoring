"justification": "The package 'issue1945.interfaces' has no outgoing dependencies (Ce=0), so it cannot have an unstable dependency. While it has incoming dependencies from 'issue1945.implementations' and 'issue1945.main', these do not create unstable dependencies for this package since they are incoming rather than outgoing dependencies."
