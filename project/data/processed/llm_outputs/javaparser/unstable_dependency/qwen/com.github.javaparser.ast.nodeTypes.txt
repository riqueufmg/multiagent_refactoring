"package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes",

"justification": "The package 'com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes' has outgoing dependencies to packages that are less stable than itself. For example, it depends on 'com.github.javaparser.utils' (Ce=10, Ca=35), 'com.github.javaparser.ast.body' (Ce=12, Ca=29), and 'com.github.javaparser.ast.expr' (Ce=14, Ca=31), which have higher instability (Ce/(Ce+Ca)) compared to 'com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes' (Ce=10, Ca=8). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
