It depends on packages such as 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel' (stability = 24/(24+10) = 0.706), 'com.github.javaparser.utils' (stability = 10/(10+35) = 0.222), and 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.types' (stability = 6/(6+23) = 0.207), which are less stable than itself. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which states that a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself."
