"package": "foo.bar",
"detection": false,
"justification": "foo.bar has Ce=0 and Ca=1 (instability I = 0/(0+1) = 0). It has no outgoing dependencies and a single incoming dependency from foo.bar.differentpackage (which has Ce=1, Ca=0, instability I = 1). Because foo.bar does not depend on any less-stable packages (no outgoing dependencies) and instead is depended on by a less-stable package, the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
