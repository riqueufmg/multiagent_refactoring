"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=1, Ca=1 -> Instability I = Ca/(Ca+Ce) = 1/2 = 0.50. It has an outgoing dependency to com.github.javaparser.ast (metrics: Ce=14, Ca=44 -> I = 14/(14+44) ≈ 0.24). The analyzed package depends on a more stable package (0.24 < 0.50), which conforms to the Stable Dependencies Principle. Incoming dependency from com.github.javaparser.printer (Ce=16, Ca=10 -> I ≈ 0.62) is less stable than the analyzed package, which does not violate the principle. Therefore there is no unstable dependency smell."
