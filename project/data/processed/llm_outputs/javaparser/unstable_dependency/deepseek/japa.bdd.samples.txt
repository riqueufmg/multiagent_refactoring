"justification": "The analyzed package depends solely on 'com.github.javaparser.ast', which has lower instability (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 14/(44+14) ≈ 0.241) than the analyzed package itself (I = 1/(0+1) = 1.0). Therefore, the dependency is in the direction of increasing stability, adhering to the Stable Dependencies Principle."
