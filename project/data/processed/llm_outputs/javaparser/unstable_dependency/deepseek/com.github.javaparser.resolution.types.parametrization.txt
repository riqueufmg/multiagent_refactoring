  "justification": "The analyzed package's instability (I = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 2/(2+5) ≈ 0.286) is greater than the instability of its outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations (3/(3+25) ≈ 0.107) and com.github.javaparser.resolution.types (6/(6+23) ≈ 0.207). Therefore, the analyzed package depends on more stable components, following the Stable Dependencies Principle."
