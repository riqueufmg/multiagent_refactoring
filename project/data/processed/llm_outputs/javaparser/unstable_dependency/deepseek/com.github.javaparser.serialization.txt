"package": "com.github.javaparser.serialization",

"justification": "The analyzed package has Ca=0 and Ce=12, resulting in instability I=1.0 (maximally unstable). All 12 outgoing dependencies have lower instability values (I<1) because they have Ca>0, making them more stable. Therefore, all dependencies are more stable than the analyzed package, following the Stable Dependencies Principle."
