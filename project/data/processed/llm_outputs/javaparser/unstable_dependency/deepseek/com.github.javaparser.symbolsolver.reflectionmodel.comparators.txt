  "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.comparators",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "The package has Ce=0 and Ca=1, resulting in stability I=0. It has no outgoing dependencies, so it cannot depend on less stable components. The incoming dependency from 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel' (I≈0.708) is more stable, which follows the principle."
