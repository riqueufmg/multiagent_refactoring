Dependencies' stabilities: com.github.javaparser.javadoc.description (0.20), com.github.javaparser.ast (0.24), com.github.javaparser (0.30), com.github.javaparser.utils (0.22), com.github.javaparser.ast.comments (0.48). No dependencies are more stable than the analyzed package. However, the smell is not detected because the definition requires a package to depend on less stable components. Here, the analyzed package depends on components with similar or lower stability, not strictly less stable, and the overall principle violation is ambiguous given the stability values."
