  "justification": "The package 'issue1945.main' depends on 'issue1945.interfaces', which is less stable. 'issue1945.main' has a stability index (I) of 1.0 (Ce=1, Ca=0, I=1/(0+1)=1). 'issue1945.interfaces' has a stability index (I) of 0.0 (Ce=0, Ca=2, I=0/(2+0)=0). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, which requires dependencies to be in the direction of stability."
