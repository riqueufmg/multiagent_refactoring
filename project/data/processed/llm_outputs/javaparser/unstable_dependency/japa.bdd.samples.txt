"justification": "japa.bdd.samples has Ce=1 and Ca=0 (instability I = 1.0) and its only outgoing dependency is com.github.javaparser.ast which has Ce=14 and Ca=44 (instability I ≈ 0.241). Because japa.bdd.samples (highly unstable) depends on a more stable package (com.github.javaparser.ast, higher Ca and much lower instability), the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
