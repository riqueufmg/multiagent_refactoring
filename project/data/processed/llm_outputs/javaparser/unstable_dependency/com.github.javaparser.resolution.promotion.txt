Its only outgoing dependency is com.github.javaparser.resolution.types (Ce=6, Ca=23, I = 23/(23+6) = 0.793), which is more stable than the analyzed package. Therefore the package depends on a more stable package and respects the Stable Dependencies Principle. Incoming dependencies from com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.promotion exist but do not create an unstable dependency here."
