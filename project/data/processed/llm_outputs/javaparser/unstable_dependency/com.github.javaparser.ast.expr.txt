"justification": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr has Ce=14, Ca=31 -> Instability I=14/(14+31)=0.311. It has outgoing dependencies to several packages that are less stable (i.e., have higher instability than 0.311): com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor (Ce=11, Ca=11 -> I=0.50), com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes (Ce=10, Ca=8 -> I=0.556), com.github.javaparser.ast.type (Ce=17, Ca=23 -> I=0.425), and com.github.javaparser.printer (Ce=16, Ca=10 -> I=0.615). Because ast.expr depends on these more unstable packages (higher I), the Stable Dependencies Principle is violated and the Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
