  "package": "com.github.javaparser.quality",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "The package has Ce=0 (no outgoing dependencies) and Ca=3 (three incoming dependencies). Its instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 0/(3+0) = 0, i.e., fully stable. Since it does not depend on any other packages, it cannot depend on less-stable components; therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not present. Incoming dependents include (default package), com.github.javaparser, and com.example, which depend on this package rather than the reverse."
