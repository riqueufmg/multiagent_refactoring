"justification": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution has Ce=20, Ca=6 -> instability I = 20/(20+6) = 0.769 (relatively unstable). It has outgoing dependencies to packages that are less stable (higher instability) than itself, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. Notable offenders: com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel (Ce=17, Ca=3 -> I = 17/20 = 0.85) and com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts (Ce=21, Ca=5 -> I = 21/26 = 0.808). Because the analyzed package depends on these packages with higher instability, the Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
