"package": "com.github.javaparser.serialization",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package has Ce=12 and Ca=0 (instability I = 12/(12+0) = 1.0), i.e. it is maximally unstable. The Unstable Dependency smell would require this package to depend on packages that are less stable (higher instability) than itself. All outgoing dependencies are more stable (lower instability) than com.github.javaparser.serialization: com.github.javaparser.utils I=10/(10+35)=0.222; com.github.javaparser.metamodel I=0.278; com.github.javaparser.ast.body I=0.293; com.github.javaparser.ast.expr I=0.311; com.github.javaparser.resolution I=0.273; com.github.javaparser I=0.296; com.github.javaparser.ast.type I=0.425; com.github.javaparser.ast I=0.241; com.github.javaparser.ast.comments I=0.478; com.github.javaparser.javadoc I=0.5; com.github.javaparser.resolution.types I=0.207; com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations I=0.107. None of the outgoing dependencies have higher instability than the analyzed package. Additionally there are no incoming dependencies (Ca=0), so no other package depends on this unstable package. Therefore the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated and the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
