    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedInterfaceDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom), 4 lines of code (loc), and a low weighted method count (wmc=4). The depth of inheritance tree is 4 (dit) and lack of cohesion is -1.0 (lcom), but given the small size and low complexity, further decomposition would not provide significant benefits. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current scope and responsibilities."
