{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ThrowStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (69 LOC, 14 methods) and complexity (WMC=18) for a statement node in an AST. The high NOM/NOPM ratio (14/14) indicates well-factored methods rather than insufficient decomposition. LCOM value of 0.714 suggests good cohesion within the class. The DIT of 4 indicates appropriate inheritance depth. This appears to be a well-modularized AST node class with appropriate responsibilities for representing throw statements."
