{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a very high number of methods (nom=789), a high number of public methods (nopm=166), and a very high lines of code (loc=10520). The weighted method count (wmc=5113) is also extremely high, indicating significant complexity. These metrics strongly suggest that the class is doing too much and has not been sufficiently decomposed, which aligns with the definition of Insufficient Modularization."
