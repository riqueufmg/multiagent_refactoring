    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavaToken.Kind",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 1 field (nof=1). The lines of code (loc=169) are likely due to documentation or nested content rather than complex implementation. With minimal functionality and low complexity metrics, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization."
