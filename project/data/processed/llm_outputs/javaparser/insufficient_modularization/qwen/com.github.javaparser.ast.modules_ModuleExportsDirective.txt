    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules.ModuleExportsDirective",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 22 methods (nom=22) and 118 lines of code (loc=118), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=33) indicates reasonable complexity. With 2 fields (nof=2) and good cohesion (lcom=0.636), the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization. The inheritance depth (dit=4) is reasonable and does not suggest poor decomposition."
