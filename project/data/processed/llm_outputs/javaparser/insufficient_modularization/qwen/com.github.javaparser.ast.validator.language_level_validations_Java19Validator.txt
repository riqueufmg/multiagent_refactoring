    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java19Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), very low complexity (wmc=1), small size (loc=9), and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The low number of methods and minimal complexity indicate that further decomposition is not necessary, as the class is already sufficiently modularized."
