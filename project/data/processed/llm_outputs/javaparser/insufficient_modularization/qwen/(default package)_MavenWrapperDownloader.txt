    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3) and 5 fields (nof=5), low weighted method count (wmc=8), and reasonable lines of code (loc=84). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, lcom=1.0) indicates it is already well modularized. The class performs a single cohesive responsibility of downloading Maven wrapper with minimal internal complexity."
