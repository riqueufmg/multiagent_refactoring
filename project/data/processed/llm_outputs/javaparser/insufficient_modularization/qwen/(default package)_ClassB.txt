{
    "class": "(default package).ClassB",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 1 public field, 0 methods, 0 public methods, and only 3 lines of code. The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. With such a simple structure and low size, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly decomposed."
