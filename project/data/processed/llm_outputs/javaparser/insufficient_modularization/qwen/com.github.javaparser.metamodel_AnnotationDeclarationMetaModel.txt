    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.AnnotationDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 8 lines of code (loc=8). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed. The depth of inheritance tree is 4 (dit=4) which suggests appropriate inheritance usage rather than excessive complexity. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and fields (nopf=0, nc=0) indicates minimal responsibilities and good separation of concerns."
