{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.PropagatingAstObserver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) with 11 public methods (nopm=11), 70 lines of code (loc=70), and a weighted method count of 21 (wmc=21). While the class has moderate complexity, it is not excessively large or complex. The low number of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and single class dependency (nc=1) suggest focused responsibility. The depth of inheritance tree is minimal (dit=1) and there are no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating a well-contained class that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
