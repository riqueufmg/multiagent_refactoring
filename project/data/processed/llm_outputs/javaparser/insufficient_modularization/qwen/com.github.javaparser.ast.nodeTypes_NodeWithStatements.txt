    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithStatements",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) and 65 lines of code (loc=65), which indicates a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=17) is relatively low, suggesting low complexity. With only 4 dependencies (nc=4) and no public methods (nopm=0), the class appears to have a focused responsibility. The lack of fields (nof=0) and public fields (nopf=0) suggests good encapsulation. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, its current size and complexity are within reasonable limits for effective maintenance and understanding."
