    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0), low complexity (wmc=2), small size (loc=21), and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The low number of methods and complexity metrics indicate that the class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
