    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal lines of code (loc=10), no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), and is already well-decomposed with a depth of inheritance of 3. The low number of fields (nof=2) and methods indicates sufficient modularization has been achieved."
