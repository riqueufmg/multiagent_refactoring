    "class": "com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserTokenManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 124 fields and 54 methods with a total of 2353 lines of code, indicating it is overly large and complex. The weighted method count (WMC) is 1130, which is extremely high, suggesting the class has excessive implementation complexity. The high number of fields (nof=124) and methods (nom=54) along with the substantial lines of code (loc=2353) clearly demonstrate that this class has not been sufficiently decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and complexity."
