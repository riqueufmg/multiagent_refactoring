    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 1 public field, 0 methods, 0 public methods, 3 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or placeholder with insufficient complexity to exhibit insufficient modularization."
