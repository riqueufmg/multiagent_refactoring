    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code (loc=5), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and minimal structural complexity (wmc=0, nc=1, dit=2). The low size and complexity indicate it is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
