    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=0) and 12 lines of code (loc=12), indicating a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 3 fields (nof=0, nopf=0, nc=3) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and focused on a single responsibility. The low complexity and small size do not indicate insufficient modularization."
