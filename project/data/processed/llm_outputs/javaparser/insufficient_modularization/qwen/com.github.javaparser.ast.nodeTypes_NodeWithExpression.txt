    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithExpression",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 10 lines of code (loc=10), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 7 nested classes (nc=7) and no fields or public methods, this interface is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
