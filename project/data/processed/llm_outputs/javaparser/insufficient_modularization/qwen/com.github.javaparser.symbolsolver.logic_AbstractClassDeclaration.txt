    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.logic.AbstractClassDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 5 methods (nom), 7 weighted method count (wmc), and 40 lines of code (loc). With only 9 nested classes (nc) and 5 depth of inheritance (dit), the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization. The low number of methods and manageable lines of code suggest appropriate decomposition."
