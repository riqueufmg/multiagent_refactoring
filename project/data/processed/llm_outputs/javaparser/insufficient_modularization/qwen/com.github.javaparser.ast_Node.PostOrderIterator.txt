    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 85 lines of code (loc=85). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and simple field count indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit complexity that would benefit from further modularization."
