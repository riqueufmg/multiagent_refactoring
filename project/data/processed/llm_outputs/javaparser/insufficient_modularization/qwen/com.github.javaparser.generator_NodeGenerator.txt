{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.NodeGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6), 8 weighted method count (wmc=8), and 37 lines of code (loc=37). The lack of fields (nof=0) and low number of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate minimal complexity. With only 9 nested classes (nc=9) and single inheritance depth (dit=1), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
