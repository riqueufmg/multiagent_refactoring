    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.LocalRecordDeclarationStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 14 methods (nom) and 18 weighted method count (wmc), which is within acceptable limits for a single class. The lines of code (loc) is 70, which is reasonable. The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and low LCOM value (0.714) suggest good cohesion. The class appears to be properly focused on its responsibility as a statement node for local record declarations, with appropriate dependencies only to core AST node types and visitors."
