{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.AnnotationDeclarationContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom), 7 weighted method count (wmc), 26 lines of code (loc), and 1 field (nof). The LCOM value is 0.0 indicating good cohesion. The depth of inheritance tree (dit) is 2 which is reasonable. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains manageable size and complexity metrics."
