    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.UnaryExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18, nopm=18) and 105 lines of code (loc=105), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 23, indicating moderate complexity. The class has 4 fields (nof=4) and 0 public fields (nopf=0), showing proper encapsulation. The LCOM value of 0.555 suggests reasonable cohesion. While the class has multiple dependencies (10 total), this is expected for a complex AST expression node that needs to integrate with various visitor patterns and meta-model components. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
