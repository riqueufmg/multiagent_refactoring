    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods and WMC of 22, which is manageable. The LCOM value of 0.4285714285714285 indicates reasonable cohesion. With only 71 lines of code and 7 fields, the class size is not excessive. The class appears to have a single responsibility with appropriate method count and complexity metrics that do not indicate insufficient modularization."
