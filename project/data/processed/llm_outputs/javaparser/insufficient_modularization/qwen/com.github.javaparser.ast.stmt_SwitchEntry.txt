    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.SwitchEntry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom=24, nopm=24) and 193 lines of code (loc=193), with a high weighted method count (wmc=46). The class also has 10 dependencies, indicating high complexity and potential violation of single responsibility principle. The high number of methods and lines of code suggest that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
