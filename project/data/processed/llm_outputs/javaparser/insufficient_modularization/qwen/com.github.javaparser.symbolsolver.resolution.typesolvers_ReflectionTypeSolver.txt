    "justification": "The class has a low number of fields (4), methods (4), and lines of code (50). The Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) is 5, which is low. The Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM) is 0.75, which is moderate but not high enough to indicate insufficient modularization. The class does not exhibit high complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
