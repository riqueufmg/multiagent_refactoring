    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), small size (loc=12), and follows a clear single responsibility pattern as a metamodel class. The low number of fields (nof=4) and methods indicates proper modularization without excessive internal complexity that would require further decomposition."
