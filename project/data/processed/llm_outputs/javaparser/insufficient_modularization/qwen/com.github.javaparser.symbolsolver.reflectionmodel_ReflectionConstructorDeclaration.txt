    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with all being public (nopm=9), indicating a focused responsibility. The lines of code (loc=50) and weighted method count (wmc=13) are relatively low, suggesting manageable complexity. The lack of fields (nof=2, nc=0) and low method count indicate this class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
