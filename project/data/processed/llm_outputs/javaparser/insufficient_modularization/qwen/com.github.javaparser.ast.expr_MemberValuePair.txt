    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) and 2 fields (nof=2), with a WMC of 20 indicating moderate complexity. The LCOM value of 0.4615384615384615 suggests reasonable cohesion. While the class has multiple dependencies (10), the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The LOC of 80 is relatively small, and the DIT of 3 indicates a reasonable inheritance depth."
