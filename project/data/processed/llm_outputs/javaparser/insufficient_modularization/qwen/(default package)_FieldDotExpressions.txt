    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), 7 lines of code (loc=7), and a Weighted Method Count of 1 (wmc=1). These metrics indicate minimal size and implementation complexity that do not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple nature."
