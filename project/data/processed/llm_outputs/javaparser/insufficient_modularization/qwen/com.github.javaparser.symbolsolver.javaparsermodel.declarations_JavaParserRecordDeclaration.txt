    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (50 total, 47 public) and a high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) of 85, indicating high complexity. The Lines of Code (401) further supports its large size. Although LCOM is low (0.3), suggesting good cohesion, the sheer size and method count indicate that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce complexity and improve maintainability, which aligns with the characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
