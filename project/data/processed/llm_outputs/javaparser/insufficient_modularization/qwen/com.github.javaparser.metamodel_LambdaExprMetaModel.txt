    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.LambdaExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 4 fields which are all property fields (nof=4, nopf=4), and 12 lines of code. The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity, indicates sufficient modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the class appears to be properly focused with no indication of needing further decomposition."
