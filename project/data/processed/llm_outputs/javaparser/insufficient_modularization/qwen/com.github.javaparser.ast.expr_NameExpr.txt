    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.NameExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) and 85 lines of code (loc=85), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=20) indicates reasonable complexity. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and 1 field (nof=1), the class is not overly complex. The LCOM value of 0.6875 suggests reasonable cohesion. The class has 10 dependencies, which is manageable. While the class has multiple methods, its size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a well-contained expression class with appropriate responsibilities."
