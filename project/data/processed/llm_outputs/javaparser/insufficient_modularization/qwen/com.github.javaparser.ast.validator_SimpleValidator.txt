{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.SimpleValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), very low complexity (wmc=2), small size (loc=13), and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The low number of methods and minimal complexity indicate that further decomposition is not necessary as the class is already sufficiently simple and small."
