    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ReturnStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17, nopm=17) with a WMC of 25, which indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. The LOC is 96, which is reasonable for a class with this functionality. The DIT of 4 suggests appropriate inheritance depth. The LCOM of 0.588 indicates some cohesion issues but not severe enough to warrant decomposition. The class has minimal external dependencies and no fanin/fanout, suggesting it's relatively self-contained. While there's room for improvement in cohesion, the metrics do not indicate sufficient severity to classify this as Insufficient Modularization."
