    "class": "demo.Main",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with a low weighted method count (wmc=4), indicating low complexity. The lines of code (loc=31) are relatively small and the class does not exhibit signs of excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The metrics suggest the class is already sufficiently modularized."
