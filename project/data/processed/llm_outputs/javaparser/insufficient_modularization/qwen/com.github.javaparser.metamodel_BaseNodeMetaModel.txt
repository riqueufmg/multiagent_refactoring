    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BaseNodeMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 33 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 21 which is excessive for a single class, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 168 suggesting the class is doing too much. The class contains both fields (nof=9) and many methods (nom=21) that could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
