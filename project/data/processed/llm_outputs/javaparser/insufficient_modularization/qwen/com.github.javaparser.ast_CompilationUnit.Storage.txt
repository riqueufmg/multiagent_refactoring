    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 83 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no public methods or fields suggesting a simple data structure rather than a complex class requiring decomposition. The low fanin and fanout values indicate minimal dependencies, suggesting this is already a well-isolated simple component."
