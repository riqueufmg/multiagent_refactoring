{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.SwitchStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18, nopm=18) and a Weighted Method Count of 29 (wmc=29), indicating high implementation complexity. With 111 lines of code (loc=111) and only 2 fields (nof=2), the class is doing too much work and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and complexity. The high WMC value suggests that the class has complex method implementations that would be better distributed across multiple smaller, more focused classes."
