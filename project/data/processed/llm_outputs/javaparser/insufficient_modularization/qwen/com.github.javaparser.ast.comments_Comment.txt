    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 35 methods (nom), 43 weighted method count (wmc), 158 lines of code (loc), and 9 nested classes (nc). The high number of methods and complexity suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
