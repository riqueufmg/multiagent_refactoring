    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.cache.NoCache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 methods (nom=9, nopm=9) and 37 lines of code (loc=37), which indicates a small and manageable size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=9), suggesting low complexity. With no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be properly modularized with a single, focused responsibility. The lack of complexity and small size do not indicate insufficient modularization."
