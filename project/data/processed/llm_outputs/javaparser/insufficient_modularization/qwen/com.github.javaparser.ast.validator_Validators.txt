    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6, nopm=6), low weight method count (wmc=7), and reasonable lines of code (loc=30). The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion, and the class appears to be well-focused with appropriate responsibilities. No clear indication of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
