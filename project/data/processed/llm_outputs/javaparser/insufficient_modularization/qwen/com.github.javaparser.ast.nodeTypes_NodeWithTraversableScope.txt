    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithTraversableScope",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), very few lines of code (loc=9), and only 2 nested classes (nc=2). The low number of methods and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
