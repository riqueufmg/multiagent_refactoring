    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ProperLowerBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 32 lines of code (loc=32), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=9) is low, suggesting low complexity. With 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains good encapsulation. The Lack of Cohesion in Methods (lcom=0.0) indicates high cohesion, meaning the methods are well-related to each other. The class has no inheritance (dit=0) and no fan-in or fan-out dependencies, suggesting it's a simple, focused class that doesn't require further decomposition."
