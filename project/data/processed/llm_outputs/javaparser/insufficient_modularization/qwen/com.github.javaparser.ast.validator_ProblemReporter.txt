    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4), 28 lines of code (loc=28), and 1 field (nof=1). The LCOM value of 0.75 indicates reasonable cohesion. With only 4 public methods and no private methods (nopm=4, nopf=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
