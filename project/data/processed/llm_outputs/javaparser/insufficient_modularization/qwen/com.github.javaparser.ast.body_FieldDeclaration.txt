    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (31 total, 30 public) and a high Weighted Methods per Class value (49), indicating high complexity. The Lines of Code (202) also suggest a large class. These metrics indicate that the class may not be sufficiently decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
