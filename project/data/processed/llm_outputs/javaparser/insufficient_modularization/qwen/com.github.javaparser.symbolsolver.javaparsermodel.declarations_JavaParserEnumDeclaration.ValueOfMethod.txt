    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserEnumDeclaration.ValueOfMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with WMC=0, NOM=0, and only 79 lines of code. It has minimal responsibilities with only 2 fields and no methods. The DIT=4 indicates reasonable inheritance depth. While the class contains some logic, its size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a well-contained, focused inner class with limited scope and responsibilities."
