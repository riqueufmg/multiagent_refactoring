    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.Solver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 13 methods (nom=13) and 27 lines of code (loc=27), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=13) is also low, suggesting low implementation complexity. With only 1 public method (nopm=0) and no fields (nof=0), the class appears to have a simple interface. The lack of complex dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and reasonable LCOM value indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
