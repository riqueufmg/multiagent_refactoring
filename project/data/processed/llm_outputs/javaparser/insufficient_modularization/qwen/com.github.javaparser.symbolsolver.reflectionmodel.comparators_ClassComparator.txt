    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1) and 1 public method (nopm=1), with low complexity (wmc=6) and minimal size (loc=19). The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and dependencies indicates a focused, well-encapsulated class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
