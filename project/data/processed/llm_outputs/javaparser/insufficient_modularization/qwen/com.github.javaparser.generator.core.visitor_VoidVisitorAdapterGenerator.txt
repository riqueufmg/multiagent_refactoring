    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.VoidVisitorAdapterGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with low complexity (wmc=7), small size (loc=30), and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of methods and low cyclomatic complexity indicate sufficient modularization. The class does not exhibit characteristics of being overly large or complex that would require further decomposition."
