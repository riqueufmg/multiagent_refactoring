    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.postprocessors.Java25PostProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code (loc), no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), and minimal structural complexity (wmc=0). The depth of inheritance tree (dit=16) indicates it inherits from a deep hierarchy but this alone does not indicate insufficient modularization. With such minimal content and no signs of high complexity or large size, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
