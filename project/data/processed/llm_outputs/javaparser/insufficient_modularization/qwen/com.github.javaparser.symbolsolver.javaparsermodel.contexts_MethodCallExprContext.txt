{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.MethodCallExprContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=19), high lines of code (loc=312), and a very high weighted method count (wmc=86), indicating high complexity. The lack of fields (nof=0) and low number of public methods (nopm=5) relative to total methods suggests possible poor decomposition. The high WMC and LOC with significant dependencies indicate the class likely contains too much responsibility and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
