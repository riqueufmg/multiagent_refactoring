    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 14 lines of code (loc=14), which indicates a very small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies, this class appears to be properly modularized with a single, clear responsibility."
