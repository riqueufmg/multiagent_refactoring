{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitorAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom: 103, nopm: 103) and a high lines of code (loc: 536), indicating it may be handling too many responsibilities. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is also high (wmc: 104), suggesting high complexity. Although LCOM is -1.0 which might indicate good cohesion, the sheer size and method count suggest insufficient modularization as the class likely encompasses too many functionalities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
