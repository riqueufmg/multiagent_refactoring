    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.constraintformulas.ExpressionCompatibleWithType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high WMC (45) and a high number of methods (11), indicating high complexity. It also has a significant LOC (165), suggesting a large implementation size. The class directly depends on 17 other classes, which indicates potential functional complexity and lack of clear separation of concerns. These factors together suggest that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
