{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.Statement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 92 methods (nom=92, nopm=92) and 264 lines of code (loc=264), indicating high implementation complexity and size. The high number of dependencies (26 listed) suggests it may be managing too much functionality. The WMC metric of 92 further confirms high complexity. These indicators suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and complexity."
