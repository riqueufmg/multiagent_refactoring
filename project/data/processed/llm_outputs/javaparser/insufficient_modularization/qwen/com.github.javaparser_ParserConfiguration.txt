```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 methods (nom=28, nopm=28) and 21 fields (nof=21, nopf=4), with a high Weighted Method Count (wmc=41) and 339 lines of code (loc=339). These metrics indicate high complexity and size that could benefit from further decomposition. The class has a low LCOM value (0.25) suggesting good cohesion, but the sheer number of methods and fields indicates insufficient modularization as it could be decomposed into smaller, more manageable classes."
