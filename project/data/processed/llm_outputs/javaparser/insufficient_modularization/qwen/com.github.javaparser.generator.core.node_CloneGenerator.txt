    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with a low weighted method count (wmc=2), very few lines of code (loc=10), and no fields (nof=0). The low complexity metrics indicate proper modularization without excessive size or implementation complexity that would require further decomposition."
