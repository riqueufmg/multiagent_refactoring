    "class": "(default package).InnerClassFieldContainer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 4 fields (nof=4), 0 methods (nom=0), 12 lines of code (loc=12), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data container with no signs of insufficient modularization."
