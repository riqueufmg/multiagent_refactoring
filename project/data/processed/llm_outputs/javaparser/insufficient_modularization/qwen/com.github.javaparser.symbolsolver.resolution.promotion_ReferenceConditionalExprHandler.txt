    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.promotion.ReferenceConditionalExprHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 2 fields (nof=2), with a very low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=4) and only 17 lines of code (loc=17). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure indicate it is already well modularized. The class follows single responsibility principle with its focused purpose in handling reference conditional expressions."
