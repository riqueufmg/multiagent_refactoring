{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ConstraintFormulaSet",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5), 6 lines of code (loc=36), and a low weighted method count (wmc=6). The lack of fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and low method complexity indicate sufficient modularization. The LCOM value of 0.4 suggests good cohesion, and the absence of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates the class is not overly connected. The small size and low complexity metrics do not suggest the need for further decomposition."
