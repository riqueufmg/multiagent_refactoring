    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.DoStatementContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 2 public methods (nopm=2), with low complexity (wmc=3) and small size (loc=18). The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and low coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0, nc=0) indicate proper modularization. The DIT of 3 suggests appropriate inheritance depth, and the class appears to have a single, well-defined responsibility."
