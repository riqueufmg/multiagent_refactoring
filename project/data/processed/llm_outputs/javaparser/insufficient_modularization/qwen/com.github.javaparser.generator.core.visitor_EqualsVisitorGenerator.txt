    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 32 lines of code (loc=32) and a low weighted method count (wmc=6). The low number of methods and relatively small size indicate sufficient modularization. No complex dependencies or high complexity metrics suggest the need for further decomposition."
