    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) and a weighted method count of 39 (wmc=39), indicating moderate complexity. With 156 lines of code (loc=156), the class is relatively large for a utility class. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and inheritance (dit=0) suggests it may be a collection of loosely related utility methods that could potentially be further decomposed into more cohesive, smaller modules. The high WMC relative to the number of methods suggests complex method implementations that could benefit from decomposition."
