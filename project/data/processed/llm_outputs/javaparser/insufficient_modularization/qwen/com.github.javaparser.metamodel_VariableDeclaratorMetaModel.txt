    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), small size (loc=11), and minimal fields (nof=3). The lack of methods (nopm=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, lcom=0.0) indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
