    "class": "com.github.javaparser.testpackage.TestClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 6 lines of code (loc=6), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is also low, suggesting minimal complexity. With such few methods and low complexity, there is no indication that further decomposition would be beneficial or that the class suffers from insufficient modularization."
