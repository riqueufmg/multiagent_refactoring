    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 1 public field, 0 methods, 0 public methods, and 3 lines of code. The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. With such low size and complexity metrics, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently simple and decomposed."
