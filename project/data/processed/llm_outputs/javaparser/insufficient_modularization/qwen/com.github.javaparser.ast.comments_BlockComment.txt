    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.BlockComment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13, nopm=13) and 49 lines of code (loc=49), which represents a moderate size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=13) aligns with the method count, indicating straightforward method complexity. The Depth of Inheritance Tree (dit=4) suggests reasonable inheritance structure. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would constitute insufficient modularization. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest a relatively simple, focused class."
