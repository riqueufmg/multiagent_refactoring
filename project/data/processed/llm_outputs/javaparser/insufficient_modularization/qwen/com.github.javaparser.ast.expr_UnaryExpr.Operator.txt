    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.UnaryExpr.Operator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 16 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships. This suggests the class is already sufficiently modularized for its simple purpose as an operator enumeration."
