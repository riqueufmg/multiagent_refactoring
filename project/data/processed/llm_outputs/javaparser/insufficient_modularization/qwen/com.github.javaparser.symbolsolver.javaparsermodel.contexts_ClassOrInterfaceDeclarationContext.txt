    "justification": "The class has moderate size (51 LOC, 9 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=15). While it has 8 public methods which is relatively high, the LCOM value of 0.333 suggests good cohesion. The class does not exhibit extreme values in any metric that would clearly indicate insufficient modularization. The number of fields is low (1) and there are no cyclic dependencies or excessive fan-in/fan-out values provided."
