    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 31 lines of code (loc=31), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 3 attributes (nc=3) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
