    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 31 methods (nom), 37 weighted method count (wmc), 230 lines of code (loc), and 6 nested classes (nc). These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
