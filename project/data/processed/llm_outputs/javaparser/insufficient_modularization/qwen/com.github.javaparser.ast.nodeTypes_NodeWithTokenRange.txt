{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithTokenRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 0 fields (nof=0), and 7 lines of code (loc=7), indicating it is already well-decomposed and minimal in size. The low WMC (2) and absence of complex dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest low implementation complexity. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed."
