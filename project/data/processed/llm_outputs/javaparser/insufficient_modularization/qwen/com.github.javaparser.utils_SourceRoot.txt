```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 40 methods (nom=40) with 34 public methods (nopm=34), high Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=59), and 453 lines of code (loc=453). These metrics indicate high complexity and size that could benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The class appears to handle multiple responsibilities including source root management, parsing coordination, and file processing callbacks, suggesting insufficient modularization."
