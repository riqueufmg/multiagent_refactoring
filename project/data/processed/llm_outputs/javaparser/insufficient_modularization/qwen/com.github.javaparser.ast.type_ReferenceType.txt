{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ReferenceType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 10 methods (nom), 38 lines of code (loc), and weighted method count (wmc) of 10. With only 6 nested classes (nc) and 4 levels of inheritance (dit), the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization. The metrics suggest a reasonably well-decomposed class."
