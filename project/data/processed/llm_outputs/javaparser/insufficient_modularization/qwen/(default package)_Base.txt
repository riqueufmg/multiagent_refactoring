    "class": "(default package).Base",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 2 lines of code (loc=2). The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=0) and Number of Children (nc=0) metrics indicate no complex structure. With such minimal implementation, no further decomposition is needed as the class is already sufficiently simple and modular."
