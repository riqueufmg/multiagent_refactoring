    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.InferenceContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 58 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 205 indicating a large class size, and it has 7 methods with high internal complexity. The class also has multiple responsibilities as evidenced by its dependencies on various type resolution classes, suggesting it could be further decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
