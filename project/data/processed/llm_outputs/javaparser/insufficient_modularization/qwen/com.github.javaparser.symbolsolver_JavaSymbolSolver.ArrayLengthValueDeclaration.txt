    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=11 but this appears to be the enclosing file), and minimal responsibilities. The low WMC (0), NOF (1), and simple dependency structure indicate proper modularization for its limited functionality."
