    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ConstraintFormula.ReductionResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0), and only 77 lines of code. The low number of fields (nof=2) and lack of dependencies beyond a single class suggest it is already well-decomposed. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be a simple data structure or value object with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
