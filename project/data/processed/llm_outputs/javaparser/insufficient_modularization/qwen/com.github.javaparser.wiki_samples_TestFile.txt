    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 10 lines of code (loc=10), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is also low, suggesting minimal complexity. There are no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies, indicating a simple structure that does not require further decomposition."
