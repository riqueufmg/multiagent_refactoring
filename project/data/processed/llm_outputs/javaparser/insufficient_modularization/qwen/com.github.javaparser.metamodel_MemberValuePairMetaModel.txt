    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 2 fields (nof=2), and very few lines of code (loc=10). The Weighted Method Count (wmc=1) indicates minimal complexity. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality, showing no signs of insufficient modularization."
