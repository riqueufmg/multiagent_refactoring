    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.IntersectionTypeMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 9 lines of code (loc=9), 1 field (nof=1), and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of methods, fields, and minimal complexity indicate that further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
