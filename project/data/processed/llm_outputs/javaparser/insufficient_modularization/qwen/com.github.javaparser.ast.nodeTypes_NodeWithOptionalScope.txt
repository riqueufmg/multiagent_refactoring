    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithOptionalScope",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates a very small and simple class. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and low complexity metrics suggest this class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a focused interface or small utility class with minimal responsibilities."
