    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.InstanceOfExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 22 methods (nom=22) and 3 fields (nof=3), with a WMC of 38 indicating moderate complexity. The LOC is 143 which is reasonable for a class of this complexity. The DIT of 4 suggests appropriate inheritance depth. While the class has multiple dependencies (12 external classes), this is typical for AST node classes that need to interact with various parser components. The LCOM of 0.4545 indicates reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its purpose as an AST expression node."
