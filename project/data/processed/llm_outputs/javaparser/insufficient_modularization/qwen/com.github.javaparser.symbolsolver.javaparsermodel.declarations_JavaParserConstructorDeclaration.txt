    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with WMC of 13 and 11 methods, but the LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion. The class has low lines of code (53) and reasonable number of fields (3). The dependency count is manageable and does not indicate excessive coupling that would necessitate further decomposition."
