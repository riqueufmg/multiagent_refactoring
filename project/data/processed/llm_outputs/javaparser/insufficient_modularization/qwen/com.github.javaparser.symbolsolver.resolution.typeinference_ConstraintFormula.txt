    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ConstraintFormula",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal lines of code (loc=87), few fields (nof=2), and no inheritance (dit=0). The low WMC and single method indicate proper decomposition, while the low LOC and simple structure suggest the class is appropriately modularized for its functionality."
