    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.BlockStmtContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 5 methods (nom=5) and weighted method count of 18 (wmc=18). The lines of code (loc=69) and method count are within reasonable limits for a single class. The class has 10 dependencies which indicates it has clear responsibilities and collaborations. The depth of inheritance (dit=3) is moderate. There is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to have appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
