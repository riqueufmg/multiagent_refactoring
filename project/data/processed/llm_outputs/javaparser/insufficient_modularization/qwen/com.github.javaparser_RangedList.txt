    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (4 methods, WMC of 5, 22 lines of code) and moderate cohesion (LCOM of 0.5). While it has some dependencies on other classes, the size and complexity are not excessive for a single class. There is no clear indication that further decomposition would significantly reduce its size or implementation complexity."
