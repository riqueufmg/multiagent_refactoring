    "class": "(default package).Test1.Test2",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 2 lines of code (loc=2). The Weighted Methods per Class is 0 (wmc=0) and fan-in/fan-out are both 0, indicating no complexity or dependencies that would suggest insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple, minimal class that does not require further decomposition."
