    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 31 lines of code (loc=31). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating minimal complexity. With no methods or fields to decompose further, and the size being relatively small, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
