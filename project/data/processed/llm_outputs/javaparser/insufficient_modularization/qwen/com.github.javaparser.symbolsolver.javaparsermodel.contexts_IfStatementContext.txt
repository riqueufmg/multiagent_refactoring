    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods (nom=7) and a weighted method count of 24 (wmc=24), indicating high implementation complexity. The lines of code at 121 (loc=121) suggest the class is relatively large. With 7 public methods (nopm=7) and no fields (nof=0), the class appears to have high functional complexity but lacks clear decomposition into smaller, more focused components. The high WMC relative to the number of methods suggests complex method implementations that could benefit from further modularization."
