    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely an empty or minimal class. With only 307 lines of code and no complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, lcom=-1.0), this does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it lacks the complexity and size that would require decomposition."
