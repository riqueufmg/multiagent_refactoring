    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Node.DirectChildrenIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 15 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=1, nopf=0), and no dependencies. The size and implementation complexity are minimal, indicating sufficient modularization for this simple iterator class."
