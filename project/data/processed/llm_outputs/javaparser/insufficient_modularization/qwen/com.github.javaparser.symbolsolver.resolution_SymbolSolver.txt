    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.SymbolSolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14, nopm=14) and a weighted method count of 26 (wmc=26), indicating high implementation complexity. The lines of code metric (loc=106) suggests the class is doing too much work for a single unit of responsibility. The class directly depends on 15 external classes (dependencies list), showing it has multiple responsibilities and is tightly coupled with various components. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.142) do not compensate for the high complexity and numerous dependencies, making it a candidate for decomposition into smaller, more manageable classes."
