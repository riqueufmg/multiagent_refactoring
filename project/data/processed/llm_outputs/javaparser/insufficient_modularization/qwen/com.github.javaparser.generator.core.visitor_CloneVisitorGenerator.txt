    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.CloneVisitorGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (1 public), 48 lines of code, and WMC of 10. The DIT of 2 indicates single-level inheritance which is reasonable. With minimal fields (NOF=0) and parameters (NOPF=0, NOPM=1), the class shows good modularization and does not exhibit signs of insufficient decomposition."
