    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalDifferenceCalculator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (17), high weighted method count (71), and high lines of code (328), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The lack of field dependencies (nof=2, nopf=0) and low cohesion metrics (lcom=0.0) further support that this class could benefit from decomposition to reduce its implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
