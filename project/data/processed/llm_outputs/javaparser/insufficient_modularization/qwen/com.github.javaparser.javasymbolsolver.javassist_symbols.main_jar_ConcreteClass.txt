    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.main_jar.ConcreteClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, 4 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or placeholder rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
