    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmSingleReference",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 1 field (nof=1), with low complexity (wmc=5, loc=18). The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure indicate proper modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and DIT=1 indicates no inheritance complexity. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed with minimal size and implementation complexity."
