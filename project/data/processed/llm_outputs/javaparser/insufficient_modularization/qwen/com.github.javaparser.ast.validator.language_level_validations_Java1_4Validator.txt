    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java1_4Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=10), single method (NOM=1), and no fields (NOF=0). While DIT=7 indicates deep inheritance, this is likely appropriate for a validator hierarchy. The class appears to be properly modularized with focused responsibility."
