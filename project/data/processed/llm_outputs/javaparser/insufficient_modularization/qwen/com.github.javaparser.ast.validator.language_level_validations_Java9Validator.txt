    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java9Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=21, NOM=1) and shows no signs of insufficient modularization. It has a single method (NOM=1, NOPM=1) with low cyclomatic complexity (WMC=1), indicating it is already well-decomposed. The class has minimal responsibilities with only 3 fields and no public fields. The depth of inheritance (DIT=12) suggests it's part of a well-structured hierarchy, and the low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion. Fan-in and fan-out values of 0 suggest it's not heavily coupled, which is consistent with a well-modularized design."
