{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.NodeFinderVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=102, nopm=102) and a large size in terms of lines of code (loc=1868), which indicates high implementation complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=648) also confirms the high complexity. Although LCOM is low (0.0196), suggesting good cohesion, the sheer size and method count suggest that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce complexity."
