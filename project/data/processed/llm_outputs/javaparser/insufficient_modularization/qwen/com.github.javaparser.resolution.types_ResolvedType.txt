    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 29 methods (nom=29) and 128 lines of code (loc=128), indicating high complexity for a single class. It also has a Weighted Method Count of 30 (wmc=30), suggesting significant implementation complexity. The class depends on 9 different types, showing high coupling. With 14 nested classes (nc=14), this class contains substantial functionality that could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
