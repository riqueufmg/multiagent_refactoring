    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithImplements",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 49 lines of code (loc=49), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=10) matches the number of methods, suggesting simple method complexity. The class has only 5 nested classes (nc=5) and no fields (nof=0), indicating it's primarily a behavioral interface or mixin. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's not heavily coupled. While it has multiple responsibilities related to implementing types, the size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
