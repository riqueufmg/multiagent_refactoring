    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.IntegerLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15, nopm=15) and 85 lines of code (loc=85), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=19) indicates reasonable complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=2) and high cohesion (lcom=0.933), the class appears to be well-focused on its responsibility. The depth of inheritance (dit=6) and number of dependencies (nc=2) are within acceptable ranges. The class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
