    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserTypeVariableDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 27 methods (nom=27, nopm=27) and a weighted method count of 31 (wmc=31), indicating high complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and 111 lines of code (loc=111), the class implements substantial functionality with relatively few data elements, suggesting it may be doing too much. The lack of inheritance (dit=5 but only 2 fields suggests limited data extension) and high LCOM value (0.6296296296296297) indicates weak cohesion among methods and fields, which are indicators of insufficient modularization where the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more cohesive units."
