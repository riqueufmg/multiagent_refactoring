{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceZip",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (82 LOC) and complexity (WMC=9, NOM=7). The lack of fields (NOF=2, NOPF=0) and low method count (NOM=7, NOPM=7) indicate it's already well-decomposed. LCOM=0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the absence of inheritance (DIT=0) and composition (NC=0) relationships indicates a simple, focused class that does not require further decomposition."
