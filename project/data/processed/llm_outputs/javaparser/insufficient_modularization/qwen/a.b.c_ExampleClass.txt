    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 9 lines of code (loc=9) and a low weighted method count (wmc=2), indicating minimal complexity. The lack of fields (nof=1) and low coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest simple functionality that does not require further decomposition."
