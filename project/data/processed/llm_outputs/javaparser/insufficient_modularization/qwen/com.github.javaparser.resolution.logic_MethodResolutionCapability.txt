    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 3 lines of code (loc=3), and no fields (nof=0). It is a very small and simple class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low complexity metrics indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not require further decomposition."
