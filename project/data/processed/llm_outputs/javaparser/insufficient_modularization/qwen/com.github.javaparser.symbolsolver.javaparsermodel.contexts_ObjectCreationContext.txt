    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 30 lines of code (loc=30), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=8) is relatively low, suggesting low complexity. The class has no fields (nof=0) and no public fields (nopf=0), indicating good encapsulation. With only 3 public methods (nopm=3) and no class dependencies (nc=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
