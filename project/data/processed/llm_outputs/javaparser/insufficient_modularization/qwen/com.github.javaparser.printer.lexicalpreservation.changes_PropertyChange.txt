    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a small and focused class. The lack of fields (nof=3, nopf=0) and low complexity (wmc=6, dit=1) suggest proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder or utility class with appropriate size and complexity for its purpose."
