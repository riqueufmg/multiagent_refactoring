    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal lines of code (loc=9), single field (nof=1), and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized with a clear single responsibility."
