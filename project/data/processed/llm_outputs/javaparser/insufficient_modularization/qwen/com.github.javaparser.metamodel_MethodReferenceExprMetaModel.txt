    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 4 fields (nof=4). The lines of code (loc=12) are minimal, indicating a small and focused class. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=3) suggest it is well-contained. There is no evidence of incomplete decomposition or excessive size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
