{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.LambdaExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 26 methods (nom=26, nopm=26) and 158 lines of code (loc=158), indicating high implementation complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=39) further confirms the high complexity. With 13 dependencies and 3 fields, the class appears to have multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
