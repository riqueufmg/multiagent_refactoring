{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeHelper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) with a weighted method count of 45 (wmc=45), indicating high complexity. It also has 196 lines of code (loc=196) which is substantial for a single class. The class has 13 public methods (nopm=13) and no fields (nof=0), suggesting it may be a utility-like class with high functional density. The high WMC and method count suggest the class could benefit from decomposition to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
