{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.EmptyStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 methods (nom=10, nopm=10) and 40 lines of code (loc=40), which indicates a small and focused class. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=10) is low, suggesting low complexity. The class has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no direct dependencies on other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
