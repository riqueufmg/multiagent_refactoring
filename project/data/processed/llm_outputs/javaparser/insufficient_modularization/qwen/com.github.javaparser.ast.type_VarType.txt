    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.VarType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom) and 23 weighted method count (wmc) which indicates moderate complexity. With only 87 lines of code (loc) and 1 field (nof), the class is relatively small. The high LCOM value (0.933) suggests good cohesion within the class. The class has reasonable responsibilities and does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
