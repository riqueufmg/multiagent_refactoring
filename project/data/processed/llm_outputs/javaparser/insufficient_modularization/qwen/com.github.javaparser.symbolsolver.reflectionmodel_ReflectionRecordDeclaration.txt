```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionRecordDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (39 total, 37 public), a high Weighted Method Count (WMC=72), and a large Lines of Code (LOC=257). It also has a high fanout (0 dependencies listed but 19 external dependencies), indicating high complexity and potential lack of cohesion. The LCOM value (0.23) suggests some cohesion, but given the size and method count, the class likely encompasses too many responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to improve modularity."
