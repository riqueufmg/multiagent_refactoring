```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.ImportDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 23 methods with 19 public methods, WMC of 32, and LOC of 152. While the class has a moderate number of methods and complexity, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The LCOM value of 0.26 suggests reasonable cohesion, and the class appears to be properly focused on its core responsibility of representing import declarations."
