```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.NormalCompletionVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high WMC (43) and a large number of methods (18 total, 16 public), indicating high complexity. The LOC is 198, which is relatively high for a single class. The LCOM value of 0.833 suggests poor cohesion, meaning the class likely contains methods that do not closely relate to each other. These factors together indicate that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
