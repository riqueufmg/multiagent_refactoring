{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java14Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=19), low weight method count (wmc=1), and only 2 fields (nof=2). The depth of inheritance tree is high (dit=17) but this indicates it's part of a well-established hierarchy. The low number of methods and fields, combined with low complexity metrics, suggests the class is already sufficiently modularized for its purpose."
