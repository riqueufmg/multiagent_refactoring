    "justification": "The class has moderate size (40 LOC, 8 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=8). While it has some cohesion issues (LCOM=0.625), the method count and lines of code are within acceptable ranges for a single class. No clear indication of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics alone."
