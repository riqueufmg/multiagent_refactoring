    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionMethodResolutionLogic",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 99 lines of code (loc=99), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=24) indicates moderate complexity but is not excessive for a class of this size. The class has no fields (nof=0) and no public methods (nopm=0), suggesting it may be a utility-like class. While the class has several dependencies (10 external classes), this is not sufficient evidence for insufficient modularization given its small size and method count. The lack of structural complexity metrics (lcom=-1.0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests limited internal complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
