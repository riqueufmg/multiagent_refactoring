    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 complexity metrics. There is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly simplified and does not exhibit characteristics of being under-decomposed or overly complex."
