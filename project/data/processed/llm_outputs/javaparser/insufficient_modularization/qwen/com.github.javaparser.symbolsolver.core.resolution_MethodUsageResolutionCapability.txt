    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 3 lines of code (loc=3). It represents a very small and focused capability class that is already well-decomposed. The low complexity (wmc=1) and minimal size indicate sufficient modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
