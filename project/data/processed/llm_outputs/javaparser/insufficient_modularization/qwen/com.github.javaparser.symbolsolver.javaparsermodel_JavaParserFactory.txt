    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC = 49) indicating high complexity, and contains 156 lines of code (LOC) which is substantial for a single class. It also has multiple dependencies (9 external classes) suggesting it handles diverse responsibilities. The combination of high complexity, significant size, and multiple dependencies indicates the class likely contains too much functionality and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
