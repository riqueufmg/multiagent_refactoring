```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (124 total, 106 public), high lines of code (1688), and a high weighted method count (354), indicating high complexity and insufficient decomposition. The large number of dependencies (80+ classes) suggests it handles too many responsibilities. The low LCOM value (0.024) indicates methods are cohesive, but the sheer size and complexity suggest the class should be further decomposed into smaller, more manageable modules."
