{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.Stringable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 6 lines of code (loc=6), 4 nested classes (nc=4) but no fields or complex dependencies (nof=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). While it has nested classes, the low method count and complexity metrics indicate it is already well modularized. The class appears to be a simple interface or utility class with minimal complexity that does not require further decomposition."
