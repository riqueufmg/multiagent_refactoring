    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ProperUpperBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 32 lines of code (loc=32), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=9) is low, suggesting low complexity. With 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains good encapsulation. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, nc=0) indicate this is a well-contained, lightweight class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
