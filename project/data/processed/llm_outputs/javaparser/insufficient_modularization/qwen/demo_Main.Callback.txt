    "class": "demo.Main.Callback",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 6 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 weighted method count. While it does have a dependency on SourceRoot, the class itself is already sufficiently minimal and decomposed. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already at a minimal size and complexity level."
