{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.main_jar.SubClassIncludedJar",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 1 public field, 0 methods, 0 public methods, and 3 lines of code. The Weighted Method Count (wmc) is 0, Number of Children (nc) is 0, and Depth of Inheritance Tree (dit) is 0, indicating minimal complexity. With such low metrics across all complexity indicators, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly simplified and does not require further decomposition."
