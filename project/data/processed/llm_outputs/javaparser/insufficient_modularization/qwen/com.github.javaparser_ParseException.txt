    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ParseException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods (4 public) and 5 fields (3 public), WMC of 24, and 120 lines of code. While there is some complexity, the class appears to be a standard exception class with reasonable size and method count. The LCOM value of 0.667 indicates some cohesion issues but is not severe enough to indicate insufficient modularization given the class's likely role as a simple exception wrapper."
