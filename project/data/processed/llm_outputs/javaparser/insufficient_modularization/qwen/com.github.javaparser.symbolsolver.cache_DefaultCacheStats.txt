{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.cache.DefaultCacheStats",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19) and 136 lines of code (loc=136), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Method Count) is 20, indicating low complexity. The class has only one dependency and no inheritance (dit=1), suggesting it's already well-decomposed. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates high cohesion, and the absence of fan-in and fan-out suggests it's not overly coupled with other classes."
