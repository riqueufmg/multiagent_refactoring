{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.ProjectRoot",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7, wmc=7) and 30 lines of code (loc=30), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. With 3 fields (nof=3) and no complex dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low method count and simple structure suggest it is adequately decomposed."
