{
    "class": "a.RefCycleClassFailure",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), 5 lines of code (loc=5), and a very low weighted method count (wmc=1). These metrics indicate minimal complexity and size, suggesting the class is already sufficiently decomposed. There are no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies, indicating a simple, well-modularized class that does not require further decomposition."
