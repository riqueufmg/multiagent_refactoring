{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionAnnotationDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 22 methods (nom=22, nopm=22) and high WMC (30), indicating high complexity. It also has 118 lines of code (loc=118) which is substantial for a single class. The class depends on 10 external dependencies, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The lack of private fields (nof=3, nopf=0) and low fanin/fanout (0 each) indicates poor encapsulation and limited interaction, which often correlates with insufficient modularization where the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units."
