    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.ObjectIdentityHashCodeVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=104, wmc=104) and a large lines of code (loc=318), indicating high complexity and size. It also has a high Lack of Cohesion in Methods (lcom=1.0), suggesting low cohesion among its methods. These metrics indicate that the class lacks sufficient modularization and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
