{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.TokenRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (61 LOC, 10 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=18). While it has 5 fields and 10 public methods, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The low LCOM value (0.2) suggests good cohesion among the class members."
