{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.Substitution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 30 lines of code (loc=30), and a low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lack of fields (nof=3, nopf=0) and low coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0, nc=0) indicate proper modularization. The LCOM value of 0.5 suggests reasonable cohesion within the class."
