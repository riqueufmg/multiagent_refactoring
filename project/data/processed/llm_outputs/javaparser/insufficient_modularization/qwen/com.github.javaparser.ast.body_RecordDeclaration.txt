    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.RecordDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 58 and 29 methods (NOM), indicating it handles too many responsibilities. The LCOM value of 0.55 suggests weak cohesion among methods, meaning the class lacks a unified purpose. With only 4 fields (NOF) but 29 methods, the class appears to be doing more than it should, violating the single responsibility principle. The LOC of 220 further supports that this class is large enough to warrant decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
