    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.AstObserverAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 10 lines of code (loc=10), which indicates a very small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. The class appears to be a simple adapter implementation with no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no inheritance depth (dit=1), making it already well-decomposed and not exhibiting insufficient modularization."
