    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 2 public methods (nopm=2), with a low weighted method count (wmc=4) and only 15 lines of code (loc=15). The low number of methods and low complexity metrics indicate that the class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
