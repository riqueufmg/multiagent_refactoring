{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ClassOrInterfaceTypeMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=12, NOM=1) and a reasonable number of fields (NOF=4). The low WMC indicates simple method complexity, low LOC shows minimal code size, and the single method (NOM=1) suggests focused responsibility. The DIT=4 indicates reasonable inheritance depth, and LCOM=0.0 suggests good cohesion. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized and simple."
