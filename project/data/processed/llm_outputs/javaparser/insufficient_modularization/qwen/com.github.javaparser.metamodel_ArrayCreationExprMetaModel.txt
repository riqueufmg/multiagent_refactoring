    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal size (loc=11), no class-level attributes (nof=3, nc=0), and no coupling with other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low WMC and LCOM values indicate proper modularization, and the small size does not suggest insufficient decomposition."
