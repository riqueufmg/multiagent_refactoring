    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserClassDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=44, nopm=41) and a high Weighted Method Count (wmc=76), indicating high complexity. The Lines of Code (loc=271) also suggest a large class. With a low LCOM value (0.2272727272727272), it indicates high cohesion, but the sheer size and method count imply that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce complexity and improve maintainability, which aligns with the characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
