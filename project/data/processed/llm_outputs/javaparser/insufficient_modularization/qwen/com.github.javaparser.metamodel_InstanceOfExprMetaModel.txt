    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal fields (nof=3), and small size (loc=11). It has no cyclic dependencies (nc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and good cohesion (lcom=0.0). The inheritance depth is moderate (dit=3) and it only depends on PropertyMetaModel, indicating proper modularization without excessive complexity that would require further decomposition."
