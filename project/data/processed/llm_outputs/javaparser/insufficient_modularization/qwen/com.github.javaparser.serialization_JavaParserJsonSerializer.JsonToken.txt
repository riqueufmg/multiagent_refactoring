    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity (LOC=8, WMC=0, NOF=1) and no methods (NOM=0, NOPM=0), indicating it is already minimally decomposed. There are no dependencies or complex metrics that would suggest further decomposition is needed. The class appears to be a simple data holder or token class that does not exhibit characteristics of insufficient modularization."
