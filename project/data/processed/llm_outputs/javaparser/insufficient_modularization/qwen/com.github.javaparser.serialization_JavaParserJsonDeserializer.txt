{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.serialization.JavaParserJsonDeserializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC=22 and LOC=126, indicating substantial implementation complexity. It has 8 methods (NOM=8) but only 1 is public (NOPM=1), suggesting potential internal method organization issues. The class depends on 9 different types, showing high coupling to other components. With no fields (NOF=0) but multiple dependencies and complex logic, the class likely combines multiple responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
