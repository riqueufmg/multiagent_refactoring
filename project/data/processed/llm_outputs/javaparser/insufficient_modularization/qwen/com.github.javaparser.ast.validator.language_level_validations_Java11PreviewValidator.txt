    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 9 lines of code (loc=9), indicating minimal complexity and size. The weighted method count (wmc=1) shows very low implementation complexity. With such a small and simple implementation, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or complexity."
