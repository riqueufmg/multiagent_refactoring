    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 methods (nom=28, nopm=28) and a weighted method count of 56 (wmc=56), indicating high implementation complexity. With 204 lines of code (loc=204) and 5 fields (nof=5), the class is large and complex enough to benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
