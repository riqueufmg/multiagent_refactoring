    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 5 lines of code (loc=5), with a very low weighted method count (wmc=1). The class is extremely small and simple, containing only a single method with no complexity. There are no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no inheritance (dit=0). Given its minimal size and complexity, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already appropriately decomposed."
