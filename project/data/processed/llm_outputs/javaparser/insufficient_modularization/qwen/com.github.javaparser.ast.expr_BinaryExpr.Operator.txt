    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.BinaryExpr.Operator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 0 methods, and 24 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies to other classes beyond a single reference to AssignExpr. The class appears to be a simple enum or data holder that is already sufficiently modularized for its purpose."
