    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.constraintformulas.MethodReferenceThrowsCompatibleWithType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=7, LOC=26, NOM=4) and a reasonable number of fields (NOF=2). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates good cohesion, and the class appears to be focused on a single responsibility related to method reference throw compatibility. The size and complexity are within acceptable limits for a well-modularized class."
