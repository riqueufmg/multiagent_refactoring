{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.AbstractGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 20 methods (nom=20) and 165 lines of code (loc=165), indicating high size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=28) further confirms high implementation complexity. With only 3 fields (nof=3) but 20 methods, the class appears to have too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high LCOM value (0.55) suggests poor cohesion, supporting the need for further modularization."
