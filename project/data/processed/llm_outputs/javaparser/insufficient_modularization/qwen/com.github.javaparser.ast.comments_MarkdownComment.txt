    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.MarkdownComment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: WMC of 24 (high cyclomatic complexity), 15 methods (high NOM), and LCOM of 0.933 (high lack of cohesion). With only 111 lines of code, the class has a high method-to-code ratio suggesting potential decomposition opportunities. The high DIT of 5 indicates deep inheritance, and the class has 6 dependencies despite having no fan-in or fan-out, suggesting it's used internally but manages multiple responsibilities. These metrics collectively indicate insufficient modularization where further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
