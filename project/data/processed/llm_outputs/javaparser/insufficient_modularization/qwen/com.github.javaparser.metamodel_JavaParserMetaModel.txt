    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of fields (119) and public fields (118), with a low number of methods (6) and public methods (2). The Lines of Code (973) is significantly high, indicating a large class size. The Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) is low (8), suggesting that despite the class size, the methods are simple. The Lack of Cohesion (LCOM) is 0.33, indicating moderate cohesion. These metrics suggest that the class is large and complex but has simple methods, indicating potential insufficient modularization where further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
