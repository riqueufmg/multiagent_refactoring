    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.AnnotationExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 12 lines of code (loc=12), and weighted method count of 2 (wmc=2). The lack of fields (nof=1) and low number of properties (nopf=1) indicate minimal responsibility. The low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and good cohesion (lcom=1.0) suggest proper modularization. The depth of inheritance tree (dit=3) is moderate and does not indicate excessive complexity."
