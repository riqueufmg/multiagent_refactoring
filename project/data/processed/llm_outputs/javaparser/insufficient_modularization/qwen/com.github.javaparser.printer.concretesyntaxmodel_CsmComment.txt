    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with a low complexity (wmc=2), 11 lines of code (loc=11), no fields (nof=0), and directly extends Object (dit=1). The class is small and simple enough that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
