    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.PrettyPrinter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 6 public), low lines of code (31), low weighted method count (7), and reasonable dependencies (5). The LCOM value of 0.333 indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality as a printer class, with no indication of excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
