    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedTypeVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17) and 77 lines of code (loc=77), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=26) indicates reasonable complexity. With a low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.294), the class appears to have good internal cohesion. The class has only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), suggesting proper encapsulation. The depth of inheritance (dit=1) is minimal, indicating it's a base class. The fan-in and fan-out are both zero, suggesting limited external dependencies. While the method count is somewhat high, the overall metrics do not indicate severe insufficient modularization given the class's likely role as a type variable resolution class in a parser library."
