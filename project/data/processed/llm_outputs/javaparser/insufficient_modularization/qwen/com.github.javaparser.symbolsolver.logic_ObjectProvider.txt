    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 7 lines of code (loc=7), and very low complexity (wmc=2). It also has minimal dependencies with only 1 dependency and no fan-in or fan-out. The class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is small and simple."
