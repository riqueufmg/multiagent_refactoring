    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom) and 15 weighted method count (wmc) which indicates moderate complexity. With only 3 fields (nof) and 60 lines of code (loc), the class is relatively small. The low LCOM value (0.1666666666666666) suggests good cohesion among methods and fields. The class does not exhibit signs of being overly large or complex that would require further decomposition."
