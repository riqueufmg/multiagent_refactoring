    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.DefaultLexicalPreservingPrinter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=11), and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The Weighted Method Count (wmc=1) indicates very low implementation complexity. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly decomposed and simple."
