    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserInterfaceDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=41, nopm=40) and a high Weighted Method Count (wmc=67), indicating high complexity. The Lines of Code (loc=233) further supports that the class is large. With 18 dependencies and a low LCOM value (0.317), it suggests the class has high responsibility and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
