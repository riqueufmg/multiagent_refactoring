    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javadoc.description.JavadocSnippet",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5), 8 weighted method count (wmc=8), and 27 lines of code (loc=27). The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=1, lcom=0.0) indicates it is already well modularized. The single field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0) suggest proper encapsulation. Size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
