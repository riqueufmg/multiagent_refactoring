    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom=21) with only 3 fields (nof=3), indicating a reasonable decomposition. The WMC of 39 suggests moderate complexity but not excessive. The LCOM of 0.5238095238095238 indicates reasonable cohesion. With DIT=1, this is a base class without inheritance issues. The low number of methods and manageable complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
