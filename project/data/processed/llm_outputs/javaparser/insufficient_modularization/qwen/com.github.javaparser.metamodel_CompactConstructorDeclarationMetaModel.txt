    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 5 fields which is a reasonable size, and 13 lines of code (loc=13). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=3) indicate it is already well modularized. No signs of insufficient modularization are present."
