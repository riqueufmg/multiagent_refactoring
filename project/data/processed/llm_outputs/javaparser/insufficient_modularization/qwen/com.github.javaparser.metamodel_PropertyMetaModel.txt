    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 26 methods with 194 lines of code, which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) of 36 indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. With 8 fields and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains good encapsulation. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class. The class has minimal external dependencies (3 classes) and no fan-in or fan-out metrics provided, suggesting limited coupling. While the method count is relatively high, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be reasonably cohesive and manageable in size and complexity."
