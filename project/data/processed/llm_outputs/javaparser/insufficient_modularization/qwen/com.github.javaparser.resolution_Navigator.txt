    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.Navigator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 26 methods (nom=26) with 22 public methods (nopm=22), high weighted method count (wmc=51), and 197 lines of code (loc=197). The high number of methods and complexity metrics indicate the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
