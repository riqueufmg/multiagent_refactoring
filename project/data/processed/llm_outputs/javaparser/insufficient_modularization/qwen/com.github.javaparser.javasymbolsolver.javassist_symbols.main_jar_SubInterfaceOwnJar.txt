    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 0 methods, 3 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed. There are no dependencies which suggests simple functionality. The class appears to be a minimal interface or data holder that does not require further decomposition."
