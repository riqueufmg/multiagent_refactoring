    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmConditional.Condition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 24 lines of code (loc=24). The WMC (Weighted Method Count) is 0, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) is -1.0 which suggests either no methods or a special case. With such minimal content and complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly simplified and does not require further decomposition."
