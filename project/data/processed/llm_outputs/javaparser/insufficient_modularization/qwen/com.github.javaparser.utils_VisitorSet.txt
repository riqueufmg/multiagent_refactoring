```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18, nopm=18) with only 5 fields (nof=5), indicating a high method-to-field ratio that suggests the class may be doing too much. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 24, which is relatively high for a class with only 98 lines of code (loc=98), suggesting high complexity. The LCOM value of 0.1111111111111111 indicates poor cohesion, meaning the methods are not strongly related to the fields. With 18 public methods and no private methods, the class exposes too much functionality that could potentially be better decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
