    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (35 total, 34 public) and a high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) value of 56, indicating high complexity. The Lines of Code (LOC) count is 341, which is relatively large for a single class. The high method count and complexity suggest that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
