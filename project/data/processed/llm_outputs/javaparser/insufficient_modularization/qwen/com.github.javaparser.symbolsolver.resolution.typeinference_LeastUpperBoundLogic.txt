    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.LeastUpperBoundLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 27 methods (nom=27) and a high weighted method count (wmc=56), indicating high complexity. With only 4 fields (nof=4) and 257 lines of code (loc=257), the class is large and complex enough to benefit from further decomposition. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.222) suggests methods are already somewhat related, but the high method count and complexity still indicate insufficient modularization."
