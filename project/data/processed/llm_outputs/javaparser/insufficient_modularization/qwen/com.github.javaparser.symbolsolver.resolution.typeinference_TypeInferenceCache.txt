    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeInferenceCache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 4 public), low lines of code (43), and low weighted method count (12), indicating it is already well-decomposed and maintains a manageable size and complexity. The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it is not overly coupled with other components."
