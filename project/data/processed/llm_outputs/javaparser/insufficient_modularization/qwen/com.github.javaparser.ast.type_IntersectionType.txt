    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.IntersectionType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18) and 92 lines of code (loc=92), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=26) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would require decomposition. The lack of fields (nof=1) and parameters (nopf=0) suggests a focused design. The LCOM value of 0.667 indicates some cohesion issues but not severe enough to warrant decomposition. The class appears to be properly modularized for its responsibilities."
