    "class": "foo.OtherClass.InnerClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods, 0 fields, and only 2 lines of code. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already highly decomposed and lacks the structural complexity that would indicate a need for further decomposition."
