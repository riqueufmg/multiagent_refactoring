    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.TreeVisitorValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 15 lines of code (loc=15), which indicates a very small and focused class. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class-level dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion within the class."
