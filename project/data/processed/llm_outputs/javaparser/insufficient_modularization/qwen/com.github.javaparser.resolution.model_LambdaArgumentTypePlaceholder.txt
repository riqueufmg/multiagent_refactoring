    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (44 LOC, 10 methods) and low complexity (WMC=10, DIT=1). While it has 4 fields which could potentially be refactored, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple placeholder with low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and manageable complexity."
