    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 13 lines of code (loc=13), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies flowing in (fanin=0), this class appears to be appropriately modularized for its simple responsibility of handling type pattern symbol declaration."
