{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.WhileStatementContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 3 public methods (nopm=3), with a low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lines of code (loc=32) are relatively small, and the depth of inheritance tree (dit=3) is moderate. These metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
