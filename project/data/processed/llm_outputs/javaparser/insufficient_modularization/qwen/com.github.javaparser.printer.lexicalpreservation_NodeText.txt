```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.NodeText",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom=24) and 124 lines of code (loc=124), with a weighted method count of 32 (wmc=32). It also has 2 fields (nof=2) and depends on 4 external classes, indicating high complexity and potential lack of cohesion. The low LCOM value (0.083) suggests some cohesion but the overall size and method count indicate insufficient modularization - the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
