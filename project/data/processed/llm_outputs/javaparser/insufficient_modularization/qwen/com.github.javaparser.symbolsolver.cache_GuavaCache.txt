    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.cache.GuavaCache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods which is within reasonable limits for a single responsibility class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 10, indicating moderate complexity. LCOM is 0.0, suggesting good cohesion among methods. The class has only 46 lines of code, which is relatively small. DIT of 1 indicates no inheritance hierarchy complexity. The single field and no public fields suggest proper encapsulation. Fanin and fanout of 0 indicate this class is currently not heavily used or dependent on other classes, but this doesn't indicate insufficient modularization. The metrics suggest a well-contained, single-purpose class that does not require further decomposition."
