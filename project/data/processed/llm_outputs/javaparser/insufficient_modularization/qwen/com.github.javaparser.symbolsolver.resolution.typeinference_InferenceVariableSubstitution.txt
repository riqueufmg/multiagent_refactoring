    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.InferenceVariableSubstitution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 3 fields (nof=3) with low complexity (wmc=3, loc=23). The LCOM value of 0.6666666666666666 indicates some cohesion issues but given the small size and low complexity, further decomposition would not significantly reduce size or complexity. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
