    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Reshuffled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 14 methods (nom) and 17 weighted method count (wmc), which is manageable. The lines of code (loc) is 58, which is relatively small. The lack of fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and low LCOM value (0.2857) suggests good cohesion. The class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
