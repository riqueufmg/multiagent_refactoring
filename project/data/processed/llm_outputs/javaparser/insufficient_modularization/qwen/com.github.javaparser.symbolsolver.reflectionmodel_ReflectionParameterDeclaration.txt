    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionParameterDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (60 LOC, 11 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=13). The LCOM value of 0.36 suggests good cohesion, and the depth of inheritance (DIT=4) is acceptable. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies indicate limited coupling. The method-to-field ratio (11 methods, 5 fields) suggests reasonable functionality distribution without clear indications of subsystems that could be further decomposed."
