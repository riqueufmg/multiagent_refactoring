    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=12), single method (NOM=1), and minimal fields (NOF=4). The lack of fanin/fanout suggests limited external interactions. While further decomposition could theoretically occur, the class is already quite simple and does not exhibit the high complexity or size that would indicate insufficient modularization."
