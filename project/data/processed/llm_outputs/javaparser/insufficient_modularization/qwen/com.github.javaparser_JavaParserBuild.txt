    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavaParserBuild",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, 8 lines of code, and 0 weighted method count. The lack of methods and low field count indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization."
