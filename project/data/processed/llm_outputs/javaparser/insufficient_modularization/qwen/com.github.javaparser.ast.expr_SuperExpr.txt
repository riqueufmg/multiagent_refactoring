    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.SuperExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17, nopm=17) and 90 lines of code (loc=90), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The WMC (Weighted Method Count) is 25, suggesting moderate complexity. The LCOM value of 0.588 indicates some cohesion issues but is not severe enough to warrant decomposition. The class has only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), suggesting proper encapsulation. The DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) is 4, which is reasonable. Given these metrics, the class appears to be adequately modularized for its size and complexity."
