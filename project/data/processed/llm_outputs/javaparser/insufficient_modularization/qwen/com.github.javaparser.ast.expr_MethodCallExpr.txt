    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MethodCallExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 61 which is very high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 33 with 30 public methods indicating a large interface, LOC (Lines of Code) is 220 which is substantial, and DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) is 4 suggesting deep inheritance. The class also has 14 dependencies which indicates high coupling and lack of clear separation of concerns. These metrics collectively suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
