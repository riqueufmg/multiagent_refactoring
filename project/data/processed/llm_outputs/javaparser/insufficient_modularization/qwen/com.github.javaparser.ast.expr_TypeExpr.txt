    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.TypeExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14, nopm=14) and 69 lines of code (loc=69), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=18) is also within reasonable limits. The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest proper separation of concerns. The LCOM value of 0.714 indicates some cohesion issues but given the small size and simple structure, further decomposition would likely not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing complexity or improving maintainability."
