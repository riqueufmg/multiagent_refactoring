{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistClassDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 39 methods (nom=39) with 35 public methods (nopm=35), indicating high complexity and lack of clear separation of concerns. The weighted method count (wmc=56) suggests high implementation complexity. The class directly depends on 12 other classes, showing it has multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
