    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, and 29 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships. The class appears to be a simple data holder or enum-like structure that is already sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
