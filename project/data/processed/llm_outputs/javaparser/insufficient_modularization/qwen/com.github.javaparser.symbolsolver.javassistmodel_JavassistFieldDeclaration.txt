{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistFieldDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) with all being public (nopm=10), indicating a reasonable level of decomposition. The WMC of 11 suggests moderate complexity, and with only 2 fields (nof=2) and 48 lines of code (loc=48), the class maintains a manageable size. The LCOM value of 0.4 indicates good cohesion, and the absence of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests the class is not overly coupled. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
