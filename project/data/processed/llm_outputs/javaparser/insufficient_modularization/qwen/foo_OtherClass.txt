    "class": "foo.OtherClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 4 lines of code (loc=4) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies. The low size and complexity indicate sufficient modularization for this simple class."
