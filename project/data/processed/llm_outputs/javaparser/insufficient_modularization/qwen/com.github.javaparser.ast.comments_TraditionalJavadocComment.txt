    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 52 lines of code (loc=52), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=14) aligns with the number of methods, suggesting straightforward method complexity. The Depth of Inheritance Tree (dit=5) indicates moderate inheritance depth. With zero fields (nof=0) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-focused with limited responsibilities. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion among methods. These metrics collectively indicate sufficient modularization for this class."
