    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.bounds.SubtypeOfBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 11 methods and WMC of 17, but lacks clear indicators of insufficient modularization. The low LCOM value (0.1818181818181818) suggests good cohesion among methods. With only 60 lines of code and 2 fields, the class size is manageable. The class appears to be a well-contained unit with focused responsibilities related to subtype bounds in type inference, and there's no evidence of internal complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
