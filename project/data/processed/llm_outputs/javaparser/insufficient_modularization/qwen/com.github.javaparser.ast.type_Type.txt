```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Type",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (59 total, 58 public), high lines of code (206), high weighted method count (67), and depends on 20 external classes. The LCOM value of 0.898 suggests poor cohesion, and the high WMC and LOC indicate significant implementation complexity. These metrics collectively suggest that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
