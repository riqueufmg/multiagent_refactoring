    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.TypeMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0), low weight method count (wmc=2), reasonable lines of code (loc=12), and good cohesion (lcom=1.0). The low number of fields (nof=1, nopf=1) and methods indicates it is already well decomposed. There are no signs of excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization."
