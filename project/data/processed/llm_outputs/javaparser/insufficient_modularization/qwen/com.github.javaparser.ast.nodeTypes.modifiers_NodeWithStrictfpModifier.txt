    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 3 nested classes (nc=3) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class is already sufficiently modularized for its simple functionality as a node type modifier interface."
