{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedWildcard",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 20 methods (nom), 19 public methods (nopm), and a Weighted Method Count (wmc) of 39, indicating significant implementation complexity. The Lines of Code (loc) is 125, which is substantial for a single class. The high number of methods and complexity metrics suggest that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
