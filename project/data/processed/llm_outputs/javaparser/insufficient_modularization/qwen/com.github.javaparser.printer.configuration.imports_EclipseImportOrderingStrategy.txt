    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.imports.EclipseImportOrderingStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), low weighted method count (wmc=10), no class-level attributes (nof=1, nc=0), and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class appears to be well-focused with a single responsibility related to Eclipse import ordering strategy, and its size (loc=49) is reasonable for its functionality."
