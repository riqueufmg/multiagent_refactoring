    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithTypeArguments",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6, wmc=6) and 35 lines of code (loc=35), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The lack of fields (nof=0) and low number of methods suggest it is already well-decomposed. The negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) may indicate good cohesion among the existing methods. Given its small size and low complexity, further decomposition would not provide significant benefits."
