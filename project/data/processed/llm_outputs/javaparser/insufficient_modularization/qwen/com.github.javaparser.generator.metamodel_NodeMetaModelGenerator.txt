{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.metamodel.NodeMetaModelGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of fields (4), methods (4), and relatively low lines of code (75). The weighted method count (12) is moderate, and the lack of inheritance (DIT=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it is not overly complex. While it has several dependencies (14), these are likely necessary for its functionality as a generator class. The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates reasonable cohesion. Based on these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
