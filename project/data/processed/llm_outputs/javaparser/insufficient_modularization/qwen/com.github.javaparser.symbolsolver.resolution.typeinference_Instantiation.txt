    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 6 public), low lines of code (32), low weighted method count (9), and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
