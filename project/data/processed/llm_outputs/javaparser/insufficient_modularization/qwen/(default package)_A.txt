    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 1 public field, 0 methods, 3 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low size and complexity indicate it is already sufficiently modularized. No further decomposition would provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
