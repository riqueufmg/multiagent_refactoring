    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmIndent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4) and 14 lines of code (loc=14), which indicates a small and simple class. With a low depth of inheritance (dit=1) and no fields (nof=0), the class appears to be well-decomposed and focused on a single responsibility. The size and complexity metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization."
