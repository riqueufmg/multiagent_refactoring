    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=2, NOM=2, LOC=17) and a reasonable number of fields (NOF=6). The LCOM value of 1.0 indicates good cohesion, and the depth of inheritance (DIT=3) is moderate. The class appears to be well-focused with a clear responsibility, showing no signs of insufficient modularization."
