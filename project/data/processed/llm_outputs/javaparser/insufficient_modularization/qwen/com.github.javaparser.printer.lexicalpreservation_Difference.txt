    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Difference",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 46 methods (nom=46) and 788 lines of code (loc=788), with a high weighted method count (wmc=189), indicating high complexity. The class also declares 12 fields (nof=12) and has multiple inner classes (Difference.EnforcingIndentationContext, Difference.ArrayIterator), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
