    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ExpressionStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14, nopm=14) and 69 lines of code (loc=69), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=18) is low, suggesting low complexity. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates this class is not heavily interconnected. The LCOM value of 0.714 suggests good cohesion within the class. These metrics indicate proper modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
