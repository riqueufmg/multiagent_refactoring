    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.SingleNodeTypeValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 2 public methods (nopm=2), 17 lines of code (loc=17), and low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lack of inheritance (dit=2) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be well-focused with single responsibility."
