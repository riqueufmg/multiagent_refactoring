    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ComponentPatternExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (8 total, 8 public), low complexity (WMC=8), and reasonable size (36 LOC). While it has a high DIT (4) indicating deep inheritance, this is not indicative of insufficient modularization within the class itself. The class appears to be well-focused with only 2 nested classes and no field declarations, suggesting appropriate decomposition."
