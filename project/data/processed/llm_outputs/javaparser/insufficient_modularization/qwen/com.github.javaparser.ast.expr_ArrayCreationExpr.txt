```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ArrayCreationExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom=24, nopm=24) and 163 lines of code (loc=163), with a high weighted method count (wmc=42). The high number of methods and lines of code indicates the class is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition. The class also has multiple dependencies (13 external classes) suggesting it has complex responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
