    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.CatchClause",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13, nopm=13) and 83 lines of code (loc=83), which indicates a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=20) suggests reasonable complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no static fields (nopf=0), the class is not data-heavy. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's not tightly coupled to other classes. The LCOM value (0.4615384615384615) indicates reasonable cohesion. The depth of inheritance tree (dit=3) is moderate. Overall, the metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to have appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
