    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.Context",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 26 methods (nom), 40 weighted methods (wmc), and 214 lines of code (loc). With only 1 class dependency (nc) and no inheritance (dit=0), this suggests the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and implementation complexity."
