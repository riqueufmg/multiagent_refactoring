    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.bounds.FalseBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5), 21 lines of code (loc=21), 1 field (nof=1), and shows good cohesion (lcom=1.0). The depth of inheritance is minimal (dit=1) and there are no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class appears to be well-focused with a single responsibility and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
