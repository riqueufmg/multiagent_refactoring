    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.modifiers.NodeWithPublicModifier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 2 methods, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already appropriately decomposed for its minimal functionality."
