{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.PositionUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) with 7 public methods (nopm=7), 31 weighted method count (wmc=31), and 112 lines of code (loc=112). While the class has moderate complexity, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The WMC of 31 is reasonable for a utility class with 12 methods, and the LOC of 112 is within acceptable limits for a single class. No clear indication of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
