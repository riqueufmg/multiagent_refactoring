    "class": "com.github.javaparser.StaticJavaParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 40 methods (nom=40) with 36 of them being public (nopm=36), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 41, which is high and suggests high complexity. The class depends on 27 other classes (high fanout=0 implies no external dependencies but the dependency list shows otherwise - this is likely a metric reporting issue, however the presence of many dependencies is evident), indicating it coordinates with many other components. The LOC is 397 which is substantial for a single class. The LCOM value of 0.1 indicates good cohesion, however, given the high number of methods and dependencies, the class likely encompasses too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
