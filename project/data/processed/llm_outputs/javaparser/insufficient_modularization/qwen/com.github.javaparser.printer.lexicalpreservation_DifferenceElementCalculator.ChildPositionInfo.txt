    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and only 16 lines of code (loc=16). It contains 2 fields but no public fields (nopf=0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or value object with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. Its size and implementation complexity are already minimal, indicating sufficient modularization."
