    "class": "(default package).Issue300",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 10 lines of code (loc=10), and minimal metrics across all other complexity measures (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0). The low number of fields and methods indicates the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
