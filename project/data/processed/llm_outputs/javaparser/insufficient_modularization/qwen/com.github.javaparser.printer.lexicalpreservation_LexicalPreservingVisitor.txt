    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalPreservingVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 18 lines of code (loc=18), which indicates a small and manageable size. The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and low complexity (wmc=5) suggest proper modularization. The LCOM value of 0.6 indicates reasonable cohesion, and zero fanin/fanout shows no external dependencies that would complicate modularization."
