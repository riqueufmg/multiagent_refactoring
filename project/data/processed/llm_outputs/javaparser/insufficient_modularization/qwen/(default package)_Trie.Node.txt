    "class": "(default package).Trie.Node",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 lines of code (loc=2) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it is already sufficiently decomposed. The metrics suggest this is a minimal class that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization, which typically involves classes that are overly large or complex and need further decomposition."
