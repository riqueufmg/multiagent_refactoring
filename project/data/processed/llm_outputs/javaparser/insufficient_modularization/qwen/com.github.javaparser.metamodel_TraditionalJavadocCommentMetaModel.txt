    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=8, NOM=1) and no fields or methods that would benefit from further decomposition. It appears to be a simple, well-factored class that serves a single purpose without internal complexity that would warrant additional modularization."
