{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ParseProblemException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=5, LOC=26, NOM=4) and only one field dependency. The low WMC indicates simple method complexity, few methods (NOM=4) suggest limited responsibilities, and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicate low coupling. LCOM=0.5 shows good cohesion. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately decomposed for its complexity."
