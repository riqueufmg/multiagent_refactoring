    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.metamodel.InitializePropertyMetaModelsStatementsGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 35 lines of code (loc=35), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. With no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no class-level dependencies (nc=0, dit=0), the class appears to have a single, focused responsibility. The low complexity metrics suggest that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
