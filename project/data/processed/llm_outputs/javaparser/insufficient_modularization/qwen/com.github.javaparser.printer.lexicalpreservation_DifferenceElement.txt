    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.DifferenceElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 methods (nom=9) and 24 lines of code (loc=24), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=9) is also low, suggesting low complexity. With only 4 nested classes (nc=4) and no fields or public methods, the class appears to be well-contained and not overly complex. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests limited coupling, and the negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) may indicate good cohesion within the class."
