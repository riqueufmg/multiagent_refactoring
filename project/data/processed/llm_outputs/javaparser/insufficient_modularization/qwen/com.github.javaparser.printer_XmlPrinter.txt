    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.XmlPrinter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (144 LOC, 8 methods) and low complexity (WMC=10). The LCOM value of 0.25 indicates good cohesion, and the absence of fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggests it's not overly coupled. The number of fields (2) and methods (8) are within reasonable limits for a single class responsibility."
