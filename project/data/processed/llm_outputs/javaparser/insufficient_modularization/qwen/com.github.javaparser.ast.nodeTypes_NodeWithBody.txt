    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithBody",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 16 lines of code (loc=16), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 dependencies and no fields or parameters, this class appears to be well-modularized and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
