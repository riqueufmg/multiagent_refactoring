    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) with all being public (nopm=11), indicating a well-defined interface. The WMC of 15 suggests moderate complexity but not excessive. LCOM of 0.18 indicates good cohesion within the class. The LOC of 53 is relatively small, suggesting the class is not overly large. The low number of fields (nof=1) and methods suggest this class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
