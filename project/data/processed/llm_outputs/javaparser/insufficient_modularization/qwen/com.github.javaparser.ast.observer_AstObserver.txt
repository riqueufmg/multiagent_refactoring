    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.AstObserver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 33 lines of code (loc=33), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no fields (nof=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
