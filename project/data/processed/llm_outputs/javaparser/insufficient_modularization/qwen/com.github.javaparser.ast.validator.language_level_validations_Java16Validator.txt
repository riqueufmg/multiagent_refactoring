    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java16Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=16), single method (NOM=1), no fields (NOF=0), and reasonable encapsulation (NC=2). While DIT=19 indicates deep inheritance, this reflects appropriate specialization in a validation hierarchy rather than insufficient modularization. The class appears properly focused with minimal responsibilities."
