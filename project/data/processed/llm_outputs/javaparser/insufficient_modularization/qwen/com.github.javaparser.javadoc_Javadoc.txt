    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javadoc.Javadoc",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 23 weighted method count (wmc=23), indicating high complexity. With only 3 fields (nof=3) but 14 methods, the class appears to be doing too much work and could benefit from decomposition. The high WMC suggests complex method implementations, and the method-to-field ratio (14:3) indicates the class is likely handling multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
