    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=39, nopm=37) and a high Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=61), indicating high complexity. The large number of dependencies (20 external classes) suggests the class is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition. The Lines of Code (loc=228) further supports that this class is quite large and complex, meeting the criteria for Insufficient Modularization."
