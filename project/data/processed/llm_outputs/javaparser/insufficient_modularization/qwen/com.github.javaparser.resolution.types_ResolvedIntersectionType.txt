    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedIntersectionType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 7 methods (nom=7), 11 weighted method count (wmc=11), and 38 lines of code (loc=38). The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and low method count (nopm=7) indicate proper decomposition. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the single level of inheritance (dit=1) with no children (nc=0) indicates appropriate modularization without excessive complexity requiring further decomposition."
