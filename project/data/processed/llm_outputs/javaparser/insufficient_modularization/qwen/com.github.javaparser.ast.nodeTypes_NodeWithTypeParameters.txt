{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithTypeParameters",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 7 methods (nom), 27 lines of code (loc), and a low weighted method count (wmc) of 7. The lack of fields (nof=0) and low number of methods suggest it is already well modularized. The class appears to be a simple interface or abstract class with minimal responsibilities, not exhibiting the characteristics of insufficient modularization which typically involves classes that are overly large or complex."
