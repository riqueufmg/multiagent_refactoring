    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.FieldAccessExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 4 fields which is reasonable for a meta-model class, and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The lines of code (loc=12) and depth of inheritance (dit=3) are also within acceptable ranges. There is no indication of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be properly decomposed for its purpose."
