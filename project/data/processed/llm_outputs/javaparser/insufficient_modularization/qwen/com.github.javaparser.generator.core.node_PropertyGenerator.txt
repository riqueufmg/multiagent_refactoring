    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.PropertyGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 23 and LOC of 118, indicating it is doing too much work. It has 6 methods but only 1 is public, suggesting internal complexity that could be decomposed. The class has 13 dependencies, which is high and indicates it is coordinating too many external components. LCOM of 0.333 suggests some lack of cohesion, and with DIT of 2 and only 2 fields, it appears to be a complex class that hasn't been sufficiently decomposed to reduce its implementation complexity."
