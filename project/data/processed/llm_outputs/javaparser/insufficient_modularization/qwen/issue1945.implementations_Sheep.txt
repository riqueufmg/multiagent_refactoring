    "class": "issue1945.implementations.Sheep",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 5 lines of code (loc=5), which indicates minimal complexity and size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 1 (wmc=1), suggesting very low implementation complexity. With no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
