    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), with a low weighted method count (wmc=2). The class is already minimal in size and complexity, showing no signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be properly decomposed for its current functionality."
