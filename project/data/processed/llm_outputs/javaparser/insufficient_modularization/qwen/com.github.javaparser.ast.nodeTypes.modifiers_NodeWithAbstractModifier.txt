    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.modifiers.NodeWithAbstractModifier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal implementation complexity. With only 5 nested classes (nc=5) and no fields or public methods, this class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its simple purpose as a node type modifier interface."
