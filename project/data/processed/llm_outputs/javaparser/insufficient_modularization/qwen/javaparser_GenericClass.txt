    "class": "javaparser.GenericClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8, nopm=8) and 31 lines of code (loc=31), which represents a relatively small and manageable size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=8) is low, indicating low complexity. The Lack of Cohesion metric (lcom=1.0) suggests good cohesion within the class. With only 1 field (nof=1, nopf=1) and no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
