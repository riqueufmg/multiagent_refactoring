    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19, nopm=19) and 77 lines of code (loc=77), which represents a moderate size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=20) is also reasonable. While the class has 5 levels of inheritance depth (dit=5), the low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.3684210526315789) suggests reasonable internal cohesion. The class has no fields (nof=3, all likely being static or inherited) and no public fields (nopf=0), indicating proper encapsulation. The fan-in and fan-out are both zero, suggesting limited external dependencies. Given these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains reasonable size, complexity, and cohesion."
