{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.UnionTypeMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), and a Weighted Method Count of 1 (wmc=1). The Lines of Code (loc=9) is minimal, indicating the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low DIT (3) and absence of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) further support that this is a simple, well-factored class."
