```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java17Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal lines of code (loc=15), and simple structure (nof=2, nc=2). The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion, and the low DIT (20) suggests it's not deeply nested in inheritance hierarchy. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized with focused responsibilities."
