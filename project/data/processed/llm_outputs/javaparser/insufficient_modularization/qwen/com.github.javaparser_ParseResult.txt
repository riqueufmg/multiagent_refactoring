    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ParseResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 87 lines of code (loc=87), which is within reasonable size limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=14) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would warrant decomposition. With 4 fields (nof=4) and no public fields (nopf=0), the data encapsulation is appropriate. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and coupling metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest this is a relatively simple, self-contained class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
