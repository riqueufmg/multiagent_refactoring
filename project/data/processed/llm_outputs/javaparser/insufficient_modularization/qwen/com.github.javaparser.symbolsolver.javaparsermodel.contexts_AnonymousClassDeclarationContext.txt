    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.AnonymousClassDeclarationContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 total, 4 public), low complexity (WMC=20), and reasonable size (LOC=78). The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates good cohesion, and the lack of fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggests it is not overly coupled. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization based on complexity, size, or cohesion issues."
