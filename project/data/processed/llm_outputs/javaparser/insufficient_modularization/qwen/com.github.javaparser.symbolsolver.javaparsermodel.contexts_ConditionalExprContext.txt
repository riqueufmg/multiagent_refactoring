{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.ConditionalExprContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 2 public methods (nopm=2), with a low weighted method count (wmc=4) and only 20 lines of code (loc=20). The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and low complexity metrics indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
