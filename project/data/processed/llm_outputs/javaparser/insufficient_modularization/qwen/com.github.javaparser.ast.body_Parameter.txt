{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.Parameter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 26 methods (nom=26, nopm=26) and 221 lines of code (loc=221), indicating a large and complex implementation. The weighted method count (wmc=55) further confirms high complexity. With 6 fields (nof=6) and 14 dependencies, the class appears to have multiple responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
