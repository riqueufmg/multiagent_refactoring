{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalPreservingPrinter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (14), a high weighted method count (63), and a large number of lines of code (592). It also has a high number of dependencies (24), indicating high complexity and potential lack of cohesion. The LCOM value (0.214) suggests some cohesion issues. These metrics indicate that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
