    "class": "com.github.javaparser.UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider.LineCounter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 69 lines of code (loc=69). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) indicates minimal implementation complexity. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the low complexity and small size do not indicate insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
