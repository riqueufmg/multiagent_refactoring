    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 32 lines of code (loc=32). It has minimal responsibilities with only 2 fields and no public fields. The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
