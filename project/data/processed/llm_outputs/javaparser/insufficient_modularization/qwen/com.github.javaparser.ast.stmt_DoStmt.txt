    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.DoStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16, nopm=16) and 89 lines of code (loc=89), which indicates a relatively simple class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 23 (wmc=23), which is moderate. The Lack of Cohesion metric is 0.625 (lcom=0.625), indicating reasonable cohesion. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be well-structured and not overly complex. The class has 10 dependencies, but this is not excessive for a class in the AST statement package. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to have appropriate size and complexity for its purpose."
