    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ControlFlowLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 22 methods (nom=22) with a weighted method count of 47 (wmc=47), indicating high complexity. It also has 132 lines of code (loc=132) which is substantial for a single class. The class directly depends on 16 other classes (dependencies count=16), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) do not offset the high internal complexity and size, indicating insufficient modularization where further decomposition could reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
