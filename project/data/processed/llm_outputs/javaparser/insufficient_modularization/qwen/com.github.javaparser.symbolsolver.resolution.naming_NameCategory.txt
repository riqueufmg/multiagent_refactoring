    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.naming.NameCategory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 23 lines of code (loc=23), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and a reasonable lack of cohesion metric (lcom=0.75), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already well-decomposed and maintains a simple structure."
