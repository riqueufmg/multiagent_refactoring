    "class": "com.github.javaparser.SimpleCharStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (50 LOC) and complexity (WMC=8, NOM=8), with reasonable method distribution. The LCOM value of 0.375 indicates good cohesion, and the DIT of 2 shows appropriate inheritance depth. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies suggest it's a self-contained utility class. The metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
