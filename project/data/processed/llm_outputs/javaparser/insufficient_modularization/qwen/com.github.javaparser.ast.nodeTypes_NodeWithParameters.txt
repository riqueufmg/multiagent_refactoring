    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithParameters",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18) and 91 lines of code (loc=91), which is within reasonable limits for a well-focused class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) equals the number of methods (wmc=18), indicating simple method complexity. The class has 7 nested classes (nc=7) but this is not excessive. There are no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) suggesting good separation of concerns. The lack of fanin and fanout dependencies indicates low coupling. While the class contains multiple methods for parameter handling, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition."
