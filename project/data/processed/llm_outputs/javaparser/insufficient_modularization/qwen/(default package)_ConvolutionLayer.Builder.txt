    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 lines of code (loc=2) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) indicating minimal implementation complexity. There are no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already highly simplified and decomposed."
