{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.ConcreteSyntaxModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 158 lines of code (loc=158), with a weighted method count of 12 (wmc=12). The high LCOM value of 0.8181818181818182 indicates poor cohesion, suggesting that the class contains methods that are not closely related to each other. The combination of relatively high size (158 LOC), moderate method count (11 methods), and high lack of cohesion (LCOM=0.818) indicates that this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
