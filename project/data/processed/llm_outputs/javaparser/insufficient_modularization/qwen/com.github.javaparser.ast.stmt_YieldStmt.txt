{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.YieldStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 14 methods and WMC of 18, but this is appropriate for a statement node in an AST. The LCOM value of 0.714 indicates reasonable cohesion. With only 73 lines of code and 1 field, the class is not excessively large. The inheritance depth of 4 is reasonable for AST nodes. The class appears to be properly decomposed for its purpose as a yield statement representation in a parser AST."
