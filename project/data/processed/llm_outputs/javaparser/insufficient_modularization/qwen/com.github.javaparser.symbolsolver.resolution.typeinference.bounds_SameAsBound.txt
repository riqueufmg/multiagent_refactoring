    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.bounds.SameAsBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 10 methods and WMC of 16, but it's likely a well-contained boundary class with clear responsibilities. The low LCOM value (0.2) indicates good cohesion among methods, and the small number of fields (2 NOF) suggests focused data representation. While it has dependencies on 3 external types, this is typical for resolution/inference components. The size (57 LOC) and method count are within reasonable limits for a cohesive unit handling type inference bounds."
