    "justification": "Class has 0 fields, 0 methods, and only 4 lines of code (LOC). WMC is 0 indicating no complexity. DIT value of 3096 appears to be an error or anomaly since it's extremely high for a class with no methods or fields, but the class itself shows minimal complexity and size that does not indicate insufficient modularization. The class is essentially empty and does not require further decomposition."
