{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.FailureHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 1 field (nof=1), and 35 lines of code (loc=35). The weighted method count (wmc=10) indicates moderate complexity. With such a small number of methods and low complexity, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed for its size and functionality."
