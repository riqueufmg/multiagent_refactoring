    "class": "(default package).InnerClassFieldContainer.InnerClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), 9 lines of code (loc=9), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data container with no complex behavior that would benefit from additional modularization."
