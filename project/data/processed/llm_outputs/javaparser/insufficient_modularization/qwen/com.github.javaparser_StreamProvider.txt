    "class": "com.github.javaparser.StreamProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5), 8 weighted method count (wmc=8), and 23 lines of code (loc=23). The lack of fields (nof=1) and low LCOM value (lcom=0.6) suggests good cohesion. With only 1 depth of inheritance (dit=1) and no dependencies, this class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
