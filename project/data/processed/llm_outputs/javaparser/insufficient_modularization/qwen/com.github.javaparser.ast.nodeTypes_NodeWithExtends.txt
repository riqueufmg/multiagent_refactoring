    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithExtends",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 52 lines of code (loc=52), which are reasonable sizes for a focused interface. The WMC of 10 indicates moderate complexity. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no fields (nof=0), the class appears to be a well-defined interface with appropriate responsibilities. The lack of complex dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple inheritance structure (dit=0) suggest proper modularization."
