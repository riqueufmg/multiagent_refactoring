    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 15 lines of code (loc=15), with a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The class is already quite small and simple, showing no indication of insufficient modularization. The low number of methods and lines of code suggest appropriate decomposition has already been achieved."
