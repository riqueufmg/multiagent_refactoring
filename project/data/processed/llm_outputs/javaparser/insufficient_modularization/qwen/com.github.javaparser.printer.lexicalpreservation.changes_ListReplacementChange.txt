    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.changes.ListReplacementChange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 35 lines of code (loc=35), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=6) is low, suggesting low complexity. The class has no children (dit=1) and no lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0), indicating proper internal structure. The number of fields (nof=3) is reasonable for a class of this size. These metrics suggest the class is well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
