    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.EnumConstantDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom=21, nopm=21) and a weighted method count of 38 (wmc=38), indicating high implementation complexity. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and 137 lines of code (loc=137), the class is densely packed with methods relative to its data. The high WMC suggests complex internal logic that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes or components. The class also has a moderate LCOM value of 0.5238095238095238, indicating some cohesion issues that further support the need for better modularization."
