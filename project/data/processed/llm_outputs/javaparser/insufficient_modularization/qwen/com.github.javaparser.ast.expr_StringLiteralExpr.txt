    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.StringLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14, nopm=14) and 71 lines of code (loc=71), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=14) indicates reasonable complexity. With 8 nested classes (nc=8), the class already shows some decomposition. The depth of inheritance tree (dit=6) suggests it's part of a well-structured hierarchy. The class has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) which reduces complexity. While there are 8 dependencies, this is reasonable for a class in the AST expression package that needs to integrate with various parser components. The LCOM value of -1.0 indicates good cohesion among methods. Overall, the class appears to be of moderate size and complexity with appropriate decomposition."
