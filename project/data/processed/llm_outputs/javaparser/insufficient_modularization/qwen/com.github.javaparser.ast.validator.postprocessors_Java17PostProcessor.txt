{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.postprocessors.Java17PostProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies. The low WMC (0), DIT (8), and simple structure indicate it is already well modularized. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately simple and focused."
