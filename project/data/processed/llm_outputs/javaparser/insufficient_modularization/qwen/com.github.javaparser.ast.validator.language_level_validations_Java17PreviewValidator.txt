    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 9 lines of code (loc=9), indicating minimal size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=1) shows low implementation complexity. The depth of inheritance tree (dit=21) indicates it's part of a well-established hierarchy but doesn't contribute to insufficient modularization at this level. With such minimal functionality and low complexity, further decomposition would not provide benefits."
