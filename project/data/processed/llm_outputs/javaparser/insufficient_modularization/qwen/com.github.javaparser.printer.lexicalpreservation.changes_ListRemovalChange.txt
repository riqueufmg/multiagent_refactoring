    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods (nom), 9 weighted method count (wmc), and 41 lines of code (loc). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low coupling (lcom=0.333) suggest it is already well-decomposed. The small number of fields (nof=2) and methods indicate it is focused on a single responsibility without evidence of insufficient modularization."
