    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0), 11 lines of code (loc=11), and a low weighted method count (wmc=2). The low number of methods and small size indicate sufficient modularization. No complex dependencies or high complexity metrics suggest insufficient modularization issues."
