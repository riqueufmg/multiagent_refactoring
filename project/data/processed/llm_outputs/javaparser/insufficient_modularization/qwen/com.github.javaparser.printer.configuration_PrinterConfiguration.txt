{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.PrinterConfiguration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, wmc=5) and 10 lines of code (loc=10), which indicates a small and simple implementation. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class does not exhibit complexity that would require further decomposition. The low method count and minimal code size suggest adequate modularization for its current functionality."
