{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.cache.InMemoryCache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) with 9 being public (nopm=9), which indicates a reasonable level of decomposition. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 10, matching the number of methods, suggesting each method has a cyclomatic complexity of 1. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) is 0.3, indicating moderate cohesion. With only 44 lines of code (loc=44) and 1 field (nof=1), the class is relatively small and focused. The DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) is 1, showing no inheritance complexity. The low number of methods and reasonable size do not indicate insufficient modularization."
