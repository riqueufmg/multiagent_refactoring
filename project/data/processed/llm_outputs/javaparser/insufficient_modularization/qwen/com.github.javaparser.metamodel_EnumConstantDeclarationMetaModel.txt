    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.EnumConstantDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 3 fields (nof=3), and 11 lines of code (loc=11). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity, indicates sufficient modularization. There are no signs of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
