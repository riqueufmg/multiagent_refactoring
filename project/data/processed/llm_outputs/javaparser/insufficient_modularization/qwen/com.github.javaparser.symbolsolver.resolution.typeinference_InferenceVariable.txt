    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 11 methods and WMC of 17, but LCOM value of 0.36 suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 59 lines of code and 3 fields, the class size is manageable. The class appears to be a well-contained entity representing a single responsibility concept (inference variables in type inference) without clear indications of needing further decomposition based on the provided metrics."
