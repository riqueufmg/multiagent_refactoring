    "class": "(default package).B.innerClassInB",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, 8 lines of code, and 0 weighted method count. The low metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. There are no dependencies to analyze for coupling issues. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its minimal scope and functionality."
