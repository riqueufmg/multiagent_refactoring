    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ObjectCreationExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 methods (nom=28, nopm=28) and a high weighted method count (wmc=62), indicating high complexity. With 238 lines of code (loc=238) and 5 fields (nof=5), the class implements substantial functionality that could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The lack of any fan-in or fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it may be encapsulating too much responsibility without proper modularization, meeting the criteria for Insufficient Modularization."
