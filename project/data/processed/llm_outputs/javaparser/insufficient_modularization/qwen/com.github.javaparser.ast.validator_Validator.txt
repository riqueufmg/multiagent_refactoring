```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 10 lines of code (loc=10), and 4 nested classes (nc=4). The low number of methods and low cyclomatic complexity indicate that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The nested classes suggest appropriate encapsulation rather than lack of decomposition."
