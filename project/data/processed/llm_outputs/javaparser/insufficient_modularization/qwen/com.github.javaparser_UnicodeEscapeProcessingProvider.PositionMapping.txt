    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=4, nopf=0), WMC=0, and NC=0. The LOC is 117 which is moderate. Without any methods or complex behavior indicated by the metrics, there is insufficient evidence of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data structure or value object."
