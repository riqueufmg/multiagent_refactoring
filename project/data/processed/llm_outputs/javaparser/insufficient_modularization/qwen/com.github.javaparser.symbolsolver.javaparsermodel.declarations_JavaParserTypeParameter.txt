    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserTypeParameter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=30, nopm=29) and a high Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=42), indicating high complexity. The Lines of Code (loc=149) further support that the class is large. With a DIT of 5, it is also deeply inherited, which can increase complexity. These metrics suggest that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
