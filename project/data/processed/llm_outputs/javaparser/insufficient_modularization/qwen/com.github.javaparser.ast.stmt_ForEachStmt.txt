    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ForEachStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom=21, nopm=21) and a WMC of 31, indicating high complexity. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and 126 lines of code (loc=126), the class implements substantial functionality that could benefit from decomposition. The high method count and complexity suggest insufficient modularization as the class handles too much responsibility without being broken down into smaller, more focused components."
