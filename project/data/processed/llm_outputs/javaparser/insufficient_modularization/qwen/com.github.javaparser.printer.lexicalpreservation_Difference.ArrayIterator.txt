    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Difference.ArrayIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 41 lines of code (loc=41). It also has minimal fields (nof=1) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
