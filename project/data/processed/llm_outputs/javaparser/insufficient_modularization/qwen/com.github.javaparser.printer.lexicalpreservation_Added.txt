    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) with 12 public methods (nopm=12), but the WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 18 which indicates moderate complexity. The LCOM value is 0.2857142857142857 which is relatively low, suggesting good cohesion. The class has only 54 lines of code (loc=54) and only 1 field (nof=1), indicating it's relatively small. While the class has some complexity, it does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization as it maintains reasonable size and cohesion metrics."
