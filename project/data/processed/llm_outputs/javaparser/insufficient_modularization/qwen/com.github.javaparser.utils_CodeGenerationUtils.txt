    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15) with a Weighted Method Count of 24 (wmc=24), indicating high complexity. With 116 lines of code (loc=116) and 14 public methods (nopm=14), the class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization as it concentrates too much functionality in a single unit without proper decomposition."
