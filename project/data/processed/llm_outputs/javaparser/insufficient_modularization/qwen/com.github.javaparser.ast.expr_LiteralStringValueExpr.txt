{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.LiteralStringValueExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 10 methods (nom), 11 weighted method count (wmc), and 47 lines of code (loc). The LCOM value of 0.7 indicates reasonable cohesion. With only 1 field and 5 levels of inheritance depth, the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The metrics suggest a well-contained class with manageable complexity."
