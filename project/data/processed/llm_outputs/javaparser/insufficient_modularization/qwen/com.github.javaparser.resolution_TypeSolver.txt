    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 62 lines of code (loc=62), which are within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=13) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would require decomposition. The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), suggesting proper encapsulation. The number of dependencies (3) is manageable and does not indicate insufficient modularization. The lack of fan-in and fan-out metrics (both 0) suggests this class may be relatively isolated, but the internal metrics do not indicate it needs further decomposition."
