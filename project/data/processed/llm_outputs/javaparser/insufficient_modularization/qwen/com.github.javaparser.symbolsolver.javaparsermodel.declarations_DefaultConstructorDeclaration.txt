    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) and 34 lines of code (loc=34), which represents a relatively small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=9) is low, indicating low complexity. The lack of fields (nof=1, nc=0) and minimal method count (nopm=8 out of 9 methods are public) suggest the class is already well-decomposed and focused on a single responsibility. The LCOM value of 0.778 is relatively high but acceptable for a small class with minimal fields. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be properly decomposed for its size and complexity."
