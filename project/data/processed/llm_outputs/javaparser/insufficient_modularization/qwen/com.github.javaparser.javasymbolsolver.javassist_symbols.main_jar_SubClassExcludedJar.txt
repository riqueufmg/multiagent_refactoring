    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.main_jar.SubClassExcludedJar",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 3 lines of code (loc=3). It also has minimal fields with only 1 field (nof=1, nopf=1). The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization as it is already highly simplified and does not contain complex functionality that would benefit from further decomposition."
