{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.EnumDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 2 fields (nof=2), and 10 lines of code (loc=10). The low number of methods and fields indicates sufficient modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the depth of inheritance tree (dit=4) is reasonable. The class does not exhibit signs of needing further decomposition."
