{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ConditionalExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19, nopm=19) and 112 lines of code (loc=112), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=29) indicates reasonable complexity. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and no static fields (nopf=0), the class maintains a focused responsibility. The lack of direct fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's not overly coupled. The DIT value of 4 indicates reasonable inheritance depth. While the LCOM value of 0.5789473684210527 suggests some cohesion issues, the overall metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
