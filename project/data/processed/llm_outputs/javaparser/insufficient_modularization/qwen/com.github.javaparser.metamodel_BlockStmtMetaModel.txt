    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BlockStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal fields (nof=1), and small size (loc=9). The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the low number of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it is not overly coupled. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its simple responsibility."
