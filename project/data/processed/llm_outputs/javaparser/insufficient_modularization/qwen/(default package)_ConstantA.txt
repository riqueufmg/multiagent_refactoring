    "justification": "The class has very low complexity (WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1, NOPF=1, LOC=3) and no internal dependencies (LCOM=-1.0). It appears to be a simple constant class with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class is already sufficiently modularized given its minimal scope and responsibilities."
