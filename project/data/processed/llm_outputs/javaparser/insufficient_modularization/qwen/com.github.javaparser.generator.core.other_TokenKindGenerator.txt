    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.other.TokenKindGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 2 public methods (nopm=2), and a low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lines of code (loc=44) are minimal, and there are no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) or inheritance (dit=1). The lack of complexity and size does not indicate insufficient modularization."
