    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem.ReferenceTypeImpl",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 45 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 17 with 14 private methods suggesting high internal complexity, LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) is 0.82 indicating poor cohesion, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 161 which is substantial for a single class. The high number of methods and complexity suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
