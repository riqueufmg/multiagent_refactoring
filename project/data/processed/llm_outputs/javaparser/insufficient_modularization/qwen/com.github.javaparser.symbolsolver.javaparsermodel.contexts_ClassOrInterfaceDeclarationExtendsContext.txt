    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 16 lines of code (loc=16), which indicates a small and focused implementation. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. The class appears to be well-decomposed with minimal responsibilities, making further decomposition unnecessary."
