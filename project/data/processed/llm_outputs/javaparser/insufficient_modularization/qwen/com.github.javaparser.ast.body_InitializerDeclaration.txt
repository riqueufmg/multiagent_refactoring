    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.InitializerDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) and 82 lines of code (loc=82), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=21) indicates reasonable complexity. With 2 fields (nof=2) and 0.625 LCOM value, the class shows good cohesion. The dependency count is reasonable for a class of this size and purpose. While there could be potential for decomposition, the metrics do not clearly indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be of moderate complexity and size."
