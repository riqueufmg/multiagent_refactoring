    "class": "org.tensorflow.op.Ops",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 313 methods (nom=313, nopm=312) and 3172 lines of code (loc=3172), indicating it is excessively large and complex. The high number of methods suggests the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity. The class contains 17 fields (nof=17) which, combined with the excessive number of methods, indicates insufficient modularization."
