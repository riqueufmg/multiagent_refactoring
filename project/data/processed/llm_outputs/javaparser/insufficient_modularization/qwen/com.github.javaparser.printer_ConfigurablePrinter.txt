    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 4 lines of code (loc=4), and 2 fields (nof=0 suggests no fields but nc=2 indicates 2 class components). The low complexity metrics (wmc=2) and minimal size indicate this class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
