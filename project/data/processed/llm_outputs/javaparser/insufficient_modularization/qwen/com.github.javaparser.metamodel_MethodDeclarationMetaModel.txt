{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.MethodDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal fields (nof=2), and small size (loc=10). The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion, and the depth of inheritance (dit=4) is reasonable. There are no signs of insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized and structured."
