    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 7 lines of code (loc=7). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data holder or utility class with insufficient complexity to exhibit insufficient modularization."
