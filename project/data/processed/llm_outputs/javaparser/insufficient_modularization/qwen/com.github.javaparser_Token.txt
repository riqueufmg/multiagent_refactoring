    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (82 LOC), low complexity (WMC=7), few fields (9 NOF) and methods (7 NOM). The LCOM value of 0.57 suggests acceptable cohesion. With only 2 nested classes and no inheritance (DIT=1), this appears to be a well-contained, simple data class that does not require further decomposition."
