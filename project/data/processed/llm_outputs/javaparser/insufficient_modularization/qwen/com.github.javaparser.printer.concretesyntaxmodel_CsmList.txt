    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10, nopm=10) and 82 lines of code (loc=82), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=23) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. The class has no fields (nof=5, nopf=0) and no direct dependencies flowing in (fanin=0), suggesting it may be a utility or specialized class. While it has multiple dependencies flowing out (fanout=0 in input but dependencies list shows 7 external dependencies), this alone does not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its purpose."
