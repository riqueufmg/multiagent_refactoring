    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 0 fields (nof=0), 6 lines of code (loc=6), and a single responsibility. The metrics indicate a highly cohesive and simple class that does not warrant further decomposition. WMC=1 indicates minimal complexity, and the class appears to serve a single focused purpose as suggested by its name and minimal implementation."
