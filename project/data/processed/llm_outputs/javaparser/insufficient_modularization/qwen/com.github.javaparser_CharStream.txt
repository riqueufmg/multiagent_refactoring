    "class": "com.github.javaparser.CharStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 66 lines of code (loc=66), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=14) matches the number of methods, indicating each method has a cyclomatic complexity of 1. With only 1 class (nc=1) and no fields (nof=0), this appears to be a simple interface or utility class with minimal complexity that does not require further decomposition."
