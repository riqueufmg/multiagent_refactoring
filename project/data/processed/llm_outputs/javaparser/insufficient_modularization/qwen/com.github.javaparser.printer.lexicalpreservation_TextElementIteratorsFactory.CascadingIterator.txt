    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields (nof=5) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a very small size of 47 lines of code (loc=47). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and minimal complexity indicate this is a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class suffering from insufficient modularization. The metrics do not suggest excessive size or complexity that would require further decomposition."
