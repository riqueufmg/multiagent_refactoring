    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 22 fields, which indicates a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class needing decomposition. The low method count and single responsibility suggest sufficient modularization. The class appears to be a straightforward value object or configuration class with minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
