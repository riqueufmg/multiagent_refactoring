{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.SymbolResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), low lines of code (loc=18), single nested class (nc=1), and low weighted method count (wmc=4). The absence of public fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and public methods (nopm=0) indicates proper encapsulation. The class appears to be well-focused with manageable size and complexity, showing no signs of insufficient modularization."
