{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.metamodel.MetaModelGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) and 185 lines of code (loc=185), with a weighted method count of 10 (wmc=10), indicating moderate complexity. The lack of private fields (nopf=0) and low cohesion (lcom=0.625) suggest insufficient internal structure. The class directly depends on 14 external classes, indicating potential functional dispersion. These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to improve modularity and reduce complexity."
