{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.logic.AbstractTypeDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3), low weighted method count (wmc=8), and reasonable lines of code (loc=54). The depth of inheritance tree is moderate (dit=4) and there are no field declarations (nof=0, nopf=0). The class appears to be well-focused with manageable complexity and size, not warranting further decomposition."
