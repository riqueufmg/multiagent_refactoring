    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 4 lines of code (loc=4), no fields (nof=0), and implements a single responsibility. The class serves as a concrete syntax model element that does nothing (None pattern), which is appropriately simple. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already properly decomposed for its intended minimal functionality."
