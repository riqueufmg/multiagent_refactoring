    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules.ModuleRequiresDirective",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom=24, nopm=24) and 123 lines of code (loc=123), which while substantial, does not indicate insufficient modularization given its likely role as a specialized AST node. The WMC of 35 indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would suggest poor modularization. The class appears to be a focused domain object representing a module requires directive with appropriate encapsulation, and the metrics do not suggest it should be further decomposed."
