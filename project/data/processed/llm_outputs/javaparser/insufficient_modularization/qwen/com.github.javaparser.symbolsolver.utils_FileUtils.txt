    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils.FileUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is also very low, suggesting minimal complexity. With such a small size and low complexity, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
