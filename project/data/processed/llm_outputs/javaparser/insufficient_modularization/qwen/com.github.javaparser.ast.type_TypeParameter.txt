    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.TypeParameter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom=24) and 136 lines of code (loc=136), with a weighted method count of 35 (wmc=35). The high number of methods and complexity indicators suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The class also has a moderate LCOM value of 0.5416666666666666, indicating potential cohesion issues that could be improved through better modularization."
