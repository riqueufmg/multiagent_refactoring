    "class": com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java16PreviewValidator,
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=9, NOM=1) and no fields (NOF=0), indicating it is already well decomposed. The depth of inheritance (DIT=20) suggests it inherits from a deep hierarchy, but this does not indicate insufficient modularization at this level. The class appears to be a simple, focused validator with minimal responsibilities."
