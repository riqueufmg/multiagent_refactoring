    "class": "com.github.javaparser.range.A",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), 5 lines of code (loc=5), and a single responsibility. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=1) indicates very low complexity. There are no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies, suggesting proper modularization. The class does not exhibit signs of needing further decomposition."
