    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.TypeParameterMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 2 fields (nof=2), and 10 lines of code (loc=10). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity metrics, indicates that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple meta-model class with appropriate size and complexity for its purpose."
