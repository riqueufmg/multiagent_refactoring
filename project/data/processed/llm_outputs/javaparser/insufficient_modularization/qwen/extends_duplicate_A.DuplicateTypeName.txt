{
    "class": "extends_duplicate.A.DuplicateTypeName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 2 lines of code (loc=2). The depth of inheritance tree is high (dit=3250) but this alone does not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-decomposed entity with minimal responsibilities."
