    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericListVisitorAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (103), a large size in terms of lines of code (1803), and a very high weighted method count (561). These metrics indicate high complexity and insufficient modularization, as the class handles too many responsibilities without being decomposed into smaller, more manageable units."
