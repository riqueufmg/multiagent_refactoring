{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserConstants",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 nested classes (nc=2), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=158, nopf=0), and low WMC (0). The LOC is 637 but this is typical for generated parser constants files. The lack of methods and low structural complexity indicates sufficient modularization for its purpose as a constants container."
