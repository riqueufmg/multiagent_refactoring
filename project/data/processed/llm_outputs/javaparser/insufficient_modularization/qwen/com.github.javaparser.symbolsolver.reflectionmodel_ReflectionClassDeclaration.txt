    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionClassDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 35 methods (nom=35) with 34 of them being public (nopm=34), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 64 (wmc=64), which is high and suggests significant implementation complexity. The Lines of Code is 223 (loc=223), which is substantial for a single class. The high number of methods and complexity metrics indicate that the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
