{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.ObjectIdentityHashCodeVisitorGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with low complexity (wmc=2), very few lines of code (loc=14), no fields (nof=0), and only 1 public method (nopm=1). The low number of methods, low cyclomatic complexity, and small size indicate that the class is already well modularized and does not require further decomposition."
