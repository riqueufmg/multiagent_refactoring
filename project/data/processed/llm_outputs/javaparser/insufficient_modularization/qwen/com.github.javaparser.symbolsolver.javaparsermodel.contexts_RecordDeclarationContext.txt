    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.RecordDeclarationContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) and 58 lines of code (loc=58), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=17) is moderate, and the lack of complexity (lcom=0.333) suggests cohesive behavior. The class directly relates to a single responsibility - handling RecordDeclaration contexts. There is no indication of excessive size or complexity that would suggest insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
