    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 methods (nom=9, nopm=9) and 35 lines of code (loc=35), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The lack of fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and low complexity (wmc=9) suggest it is already well-decomposed. The class has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance (dit=0), indicating it is a simple, self-contained class that does not require further decomposition."
