    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3) and 17 lines of code (loc=17), which indicates a very small and simple class. The lack of fields (nof=0) and low complexity metrics suggest it is already well modularized. No further decomposition would be beneficial for reducing size or complexity."
