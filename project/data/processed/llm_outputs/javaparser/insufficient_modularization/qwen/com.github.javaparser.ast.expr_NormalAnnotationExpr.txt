{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.NormalAnnotationExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17, nopm=17) and a WMC of 25, indicating high implementation complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 99 lines of code (loc=99), the class concentrates too many responsibilities and methods, suggesting it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
