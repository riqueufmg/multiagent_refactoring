{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.InitializerDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 2 fields (nof=2), and very low WMC (1). The LOC is small (10 lines) and LCOM indicates good cohesion (0.0). The DIT of 3 suggests reasonable inheritance depth. These metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
