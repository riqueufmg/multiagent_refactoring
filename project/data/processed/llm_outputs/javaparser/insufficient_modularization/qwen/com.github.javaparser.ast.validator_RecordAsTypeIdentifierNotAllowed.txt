{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.RecordAsTypeIdentifierNotAllowed",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom), 7 weighted method count (wmc), 28 lines of code (loc), and 1 field (nof). The low method count, low complexity metrics, and small size indicate sufficient modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the class appears to be properly focused with a single responsibility."
