    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.VoidType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15, nopm=15) and 55 lines of code (loc=55), which represents a relatively small and focused class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 15, indicating moderate complexity. The DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) is 4, suggesting reasonable inheritance depth. With no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no class-level dependencies (nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), this appears to be a simple, well-focused class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
