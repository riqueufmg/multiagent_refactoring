    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 6 public), low WMC (9), and relatively small size (68 LOC). The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (nof=4, nopf=1) indicate it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
