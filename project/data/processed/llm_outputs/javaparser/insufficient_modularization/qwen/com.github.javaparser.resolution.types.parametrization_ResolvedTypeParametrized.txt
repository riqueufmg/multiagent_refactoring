    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal lines of code (loc=7), and only 2 nested classes (nc=2). The low number of methods and fields indicates sufficient modularization. There are no signs of insufficient decomposition as the class is already quite simple and focused."
