    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarators.VariableSymbolDeclarator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 19 lines of code (loc=19), which indicates a very small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 2 levels of inheritance (dit=2) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), this class appears to be well-decomposed and adheres to single responsibility principle. The negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) may indicate high cohesion among the methods, and the absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's not overly coupled. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
