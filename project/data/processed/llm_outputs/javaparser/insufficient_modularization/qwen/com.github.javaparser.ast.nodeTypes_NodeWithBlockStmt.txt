    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithBlockStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 12 lines of code (loc=12), which indicates a very small and focused class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 3 (wmc=3), showing low complexity. The class has 9 nested classes (nc=9) but this is acceptable for a small interface-like class with block statement functionality. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and methods (nopm=0) suggests it's likely an interface or abstract class defining a specific behavior. The low method count and minimal complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization."
