    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Node.BreadthFirstIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 18 lines of code (loc), 1 field (nof), 0 methods (nom), and 0 complexity metrics (wmc, nc). The absence of methods and low LOC indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple iterator implementation with insufficient complexity to exhibit insufficient modularization."
