{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitorWithDefaults",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (105), all of which are public, and a high Weighted Method Count (WMC) of 105, indicating high complexity. The large number of dependencies (97) suggests that the class is handling too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The Lines of Code (326) further supports that the class is large and potentially difficult to maintain."
