    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BreakStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 1 field (nof=1), and 9 lines of code (loc=9). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple meta-model class with basic structure and no complex implementation."
