    "justification": "The class has 25 methods (nom=25, nopm=25) and a Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) of 34, indicating high complexity. With 139 lines of code (loc=139) and 17 dependencies, the class encapsulates too much functionality and could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
