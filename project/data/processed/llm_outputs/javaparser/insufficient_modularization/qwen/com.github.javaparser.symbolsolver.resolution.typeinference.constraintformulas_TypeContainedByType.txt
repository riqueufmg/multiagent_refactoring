    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.constraintformulas.TypeContainedByType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 2 fields (nof=2), and a low weighted method count (wmc=11). The lines of code (loc=38) are minimal, indicating a small and focused class. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, nc=0) suggest it is well-contained. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class. These metrics indicate proper modularization without the need for further decomposition."
