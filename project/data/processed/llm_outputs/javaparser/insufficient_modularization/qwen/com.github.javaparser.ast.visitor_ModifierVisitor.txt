    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.ModifierVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=105, nopm=103) and a high Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=178), indicating high complexity. The Lines of Code (loc=1049) further support that the class is large. These metrics suggest that the class lacks sufficient modularization and could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
