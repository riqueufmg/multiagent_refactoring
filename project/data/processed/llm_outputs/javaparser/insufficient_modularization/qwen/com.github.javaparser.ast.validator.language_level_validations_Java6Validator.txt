    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=8), low weighted method count (wmc=1), and only 1 class component (nc=1). These metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
