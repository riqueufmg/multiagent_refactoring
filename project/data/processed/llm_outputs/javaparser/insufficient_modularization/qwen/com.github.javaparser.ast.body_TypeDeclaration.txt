{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.TypeDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom=24) and 42 weighted method count (wmc=42), with 172 lines of code (loc=172). It also has 12 nested classes (nc=12) and 3 fields (nof=3). The high number of methods, substantial lines of code, and multiple nested classes indicate that the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and complexity."
