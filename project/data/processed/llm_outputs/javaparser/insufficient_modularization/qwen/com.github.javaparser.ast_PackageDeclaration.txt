    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.PackageDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14, nopm=14) which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Method Count) is 25, indicating moderate complexity but not excessive. The LCOM value of 0.4285714285714285 suggests good cohesion within the class. With only 109 lines of code (loc) and 2 fields (nof=2), the class is relatively small and focused. The dependency list shows reasonable external references for a package declaration AST node class. Based on the metrics and dependencies provided, this class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains appropriate size and complexity levels."
