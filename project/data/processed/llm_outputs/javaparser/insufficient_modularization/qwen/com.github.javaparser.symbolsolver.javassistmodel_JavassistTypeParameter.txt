    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistTypeParameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (69 LOC, 11 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=20). The LCOM value of 0.27 indicates good cohesion within the class. With only 3 fields and no public fields, the class appears to be well-encapsulated. The depth of inheritance (DIT=4) is acceptable. There are no external dependencies reported (fanin=0, fanout=0), suggesting limited coupling. Based on these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
