    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), very low complexity (wmc=1), and minimal lines of code (loc=8). The low number of methods and complexity metrics indicate that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
