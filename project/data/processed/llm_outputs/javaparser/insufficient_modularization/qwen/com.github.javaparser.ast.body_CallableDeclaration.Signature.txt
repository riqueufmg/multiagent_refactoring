    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.CallableDeclaration.Signature",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0), and only 36 lines of code. The low number of fields (nof=2) and lack of dependencies indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or signature holder rather than a complex module requiring refactoring."
