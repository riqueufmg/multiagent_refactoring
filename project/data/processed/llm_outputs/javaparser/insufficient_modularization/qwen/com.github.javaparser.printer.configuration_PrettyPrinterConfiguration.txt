```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.PrettyPrinterConfiguration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 34 methods (nom=34, wmc=34) and 170 lines of code (loc=170), indicating high implementation complexity. All methods are public (nopm=34 equals nom=34) with no private or protected methods, suggesting lack of proper encapsulation and potential violation of information hiding. The high number of methods and lines of code suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
