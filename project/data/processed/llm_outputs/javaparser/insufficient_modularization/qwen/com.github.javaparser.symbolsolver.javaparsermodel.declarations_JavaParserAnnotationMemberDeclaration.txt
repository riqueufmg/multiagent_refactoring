    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (7 total, 6 public), low lines of code (29), low weighted method count (7), and zero lack of cohesion (0.0 LCOM). These metrics indicate the class is already well-modularized with appropriate size and complexity. No further decomposition is warranted based on the provided metrics."
