    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserMethodDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom=21) with 19 public methods (nopm=19), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 24, which is relatively high and suggests significant implementation complexity. The class also has a high number of dependencies (14 external classes listed), indicating it is tightly coupled to many other components. The LOC (Lines of Code) is 85, which combined with the high method count suggests the class is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
