    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElementIteratorsFactory.EmptyIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and minimal size (loc=8). It has no inheritance (dit=0) and no dependencies. This indicates proper modularization for a simple iterator implementation that serves a specific, limited purpose."
