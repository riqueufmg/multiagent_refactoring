    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.Pair",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=8) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=2) and no class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), this appears to be a simple data holder class that is already well modularized."
