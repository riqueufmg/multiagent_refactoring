    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.LambdaExprContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high WMC (32) and LOC (136) with 7 methods, indicating high implementation complexity. The presence of multiple dependencies (21) suggests it handles diverse responsibilities. The lack of fields (NOF=0) and low public methods (NOPM=5 out of 7) may indicate poor decomposition of logic into smaller, focused units, supporting insufficient modularization."
