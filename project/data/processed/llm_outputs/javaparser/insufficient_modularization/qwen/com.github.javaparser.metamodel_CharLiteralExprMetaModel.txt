{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.CharLiteralExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 weighted method count (wmc=1), 8 lines of code (loc=8), and no fields (nof=0). The depth of inheritance tree is 5 (dit=5) which indicates it's part of a well-structured inheritance hierarchy. The lack of complexity and minimal size (8 loc) suggests this class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
