    "class": "japa.bdd.samples.JavaConcepts.Teste",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 1 line of code (loc=1). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Since the class is essentially empty with no implementation complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition, it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
