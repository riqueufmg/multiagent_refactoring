    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedMethodLikeDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 25 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 15 suggesting the class has many responsibilities, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 114 indicating substantial implementation complexity. The high WMC value particularly suggests that the class contains methods with significant cyclomatic complexity that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes or components."
