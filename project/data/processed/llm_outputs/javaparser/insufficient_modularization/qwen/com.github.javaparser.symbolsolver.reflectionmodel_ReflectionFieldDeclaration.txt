    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionFieldDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (13 methods, 51 lines of code) and reasonable complexity (WMC=13). The LCOM value of 0.3076923076923077 indicates good cohesion among methods. With only 3 fields and low method count relative to field count, there's no clear indication that further decomposition would significantly reduce size or complexity. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its responsibilities."
