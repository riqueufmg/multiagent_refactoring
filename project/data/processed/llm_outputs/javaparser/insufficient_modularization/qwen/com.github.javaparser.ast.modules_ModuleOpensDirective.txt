    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules.ModuleOpensDirective",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom=21) and 114 lines of code (loc=114), which while substantial, does not indicate insufficient modularization given its likely cohesive responsibility as a module directive. The WMC of 32 indicates moderate complexity but is not excessive. LCOM of 0.667 suggests reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be properly focused on its single responsibility as a module opens directive with appropriate method count and complexity for this domain."
