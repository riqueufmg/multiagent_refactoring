{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmTextBlock",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4), 18 lines of code (loc=18), and no class variables (nof=1, nc=0). The lack of fields (nc=0) and low method count indicate proper modularization. No complex dependencies or high coupling detected that would suggest insufficient decomposition."
