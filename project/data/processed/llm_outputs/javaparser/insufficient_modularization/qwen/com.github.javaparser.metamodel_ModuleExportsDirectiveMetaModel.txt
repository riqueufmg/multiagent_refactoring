    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal fields (nof=2), and low lines of code (loc=10). The low WMC and LCOM values (0.0) indicate good cohesion and low complexity. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality, showing no signs of insufficient modularization."
