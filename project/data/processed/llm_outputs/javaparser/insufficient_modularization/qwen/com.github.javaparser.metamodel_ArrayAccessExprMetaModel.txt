    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ArrayAccessExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), small size (loc=10), and minimal responsibilities (nof=2, nopf=2). The low WMC and LCOM values (0.0) indicate good cohesion and low complexity, suggesting the current level of modularization is appropriate for this simple class."
