    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 0 methods, 3 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low size and complexity indicate it is already sufficiently modularized. No further decomposition is needed as the class is minimal and does not exhibit characteristics of insufficient modularization such as high complexity or large size."
