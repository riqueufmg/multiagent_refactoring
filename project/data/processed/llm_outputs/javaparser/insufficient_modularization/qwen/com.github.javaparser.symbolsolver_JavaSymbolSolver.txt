    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.JavaSymbolSolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high WMC (88), a high number of methods (15), and a high LOC (324). It also has a relatively high LCOM (0.533), indicating weak cohesion among its methods. These metrics suggest that the class is complex and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
