    "class": "issue1945.interfaces.HairTypeRenderer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (1 public) and 14 lines of code, which is relatively small. The Weighted Method Count (WMC) is 2, indicating low complexity. With only 2 methods, further decomposition would likely not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its minimal scope and low complexity metrics."
