    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, nopm=5) and 17 lines of code (loc=17), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With such a small size and low complexity, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
