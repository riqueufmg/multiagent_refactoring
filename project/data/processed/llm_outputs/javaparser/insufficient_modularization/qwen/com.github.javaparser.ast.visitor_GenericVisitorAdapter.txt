    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitorAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=103, nopm=103), high lines of code (loc=1707), and a very high weighted method count (wmc=563). These metrics indicate high complexity and size, suggesting that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its implementation complexity and size."
