    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithSimpleName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 17 lines of code (loc=17), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be well-encapsulated. The negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) may indicate high cohesion or a utility-like nature. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already small and focused."
