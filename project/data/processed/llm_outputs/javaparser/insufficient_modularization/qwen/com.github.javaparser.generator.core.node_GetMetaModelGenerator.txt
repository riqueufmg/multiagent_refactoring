    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 1 public method (nopm=1), low complexity (wmc=2), and minimal size (loc=11). The low number of methods, low cyclomatic complexity, and small size indicate sufficient modularization without need for further decomposition."
