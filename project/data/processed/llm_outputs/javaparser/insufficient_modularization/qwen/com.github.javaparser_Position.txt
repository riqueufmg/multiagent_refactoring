    "class": "com.github.javaparser.Position",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17) and 142 lines of code (loc=142), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=26) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would require decomposition. The Lack of Cohesion metric (lcom=0.0) suggests good cohesion within the class. With only 7 fields (nof=7) and no fan-in or fan-out dependencies, this appears to be a well-contained, focused class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
