    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.JarTypeSolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 19 methods (nom), WMC of 39 indicating high internal complexity, and 247 lines of code (loc). With only 5 fields and LCOM of 0.26, it shows some cohesion but the overall size and method count suggest insufficient decomposition. The class likely handles multiple responsibilities related to JAR type solving which could be further modularized into smaller, more focused components."
