    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.postprocessors.PostProcessors",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 30 lines of code (loc=30), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=7) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and 0 private fields (nopf=0), the class is not data-heavy. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest simple relationships. While the class has some responsibilities related to post-processing, its small size and low complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization."
