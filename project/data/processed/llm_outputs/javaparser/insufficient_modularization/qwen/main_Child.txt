    "class": "main.Child",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), 4 lines of code (loc=4), and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The weighted method count (wmc=1) indicates minimal complexity. With such a small size and low complexity, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed."
