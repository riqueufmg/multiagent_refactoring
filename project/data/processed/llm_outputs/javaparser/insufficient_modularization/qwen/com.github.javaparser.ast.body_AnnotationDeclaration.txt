    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.AnnotationDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14, nopm=14) and 52 lines of code (loc=52), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=14) is also low, suggesting low complexity. The class has a Depth of Inheritance of 5 (dit=5), which is reasonable. With 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no direct dependencies on other classes in terms of fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and focused on a single responsibility. The low number of methods and lines of code, combined with low complexity, do not indicate insufficient modularization."
