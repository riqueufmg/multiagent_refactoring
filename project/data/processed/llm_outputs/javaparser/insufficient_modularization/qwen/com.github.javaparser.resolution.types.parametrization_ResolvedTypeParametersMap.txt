    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.parametrization.ResolvedTypeParametersMap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) with 11 public methods (nopm=11), indicating a focused responsibility. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=17) suggests moderate complexity but not excessive. The Lines of Code (loc=84) is relatively small for a class with this functionality. The Low Cohesion Metric (lcom=0.1666666666666666) indicates high cohesion, suggesting methods are well-related to each other. With only 4 fields (nof=4) and no package dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to have a single, well-defined responsibility and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
