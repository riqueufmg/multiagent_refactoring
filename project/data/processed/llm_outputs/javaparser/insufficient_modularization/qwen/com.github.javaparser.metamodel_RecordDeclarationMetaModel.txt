    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal fields (nof=4), and small size (loc=12). It shows good cohesion (lcom=0.0) and has no external dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships, indicating it is already well modularized and does not require further decomposition."
