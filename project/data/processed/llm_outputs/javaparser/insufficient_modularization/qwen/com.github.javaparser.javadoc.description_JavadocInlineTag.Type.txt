    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javadoc.description.JavadocInlineTag.Type",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 16 lines of code (loc=16), and minimal dependencies. The lack of methods (nopm=0, nom=0) and low WMC (0) indicates it is already sufficiently decomposed. The class appears to be a simple enum or data holder class that does not require further modularization."
