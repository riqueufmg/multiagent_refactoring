    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.DotPrinter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) with 3 public methods (nopm=3), 55 lines of code (loc=55), and a moderate weighted method count (wmc=13). The low number of fields (nof=2) and methods indicates proper decomposition. The class appears to be focused on its core responsibility of printing in dot format without excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
