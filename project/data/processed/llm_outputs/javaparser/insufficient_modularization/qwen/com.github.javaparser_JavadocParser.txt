    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavadocParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with a high weighted method count of 22 (wmc=22), indicating complex implementation. It also has 100 lines of code (loc=100) which is substantial for a single class. The class has 2 fields (nof=2) and 3 public methods (nopm=3), showing significant internal complexity that could benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high WMC relative to the number of methods suggests complex method implementations that would be better distributed across multiple classes."
