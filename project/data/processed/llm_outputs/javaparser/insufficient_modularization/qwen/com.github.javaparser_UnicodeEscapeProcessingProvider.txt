    "class": "com.github.javaparser.UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics (WMC=45, NOM=19, LOC=458) and contains multiple inner classes (PositionMapping, PositionUpdate, PositionMappingBuilder, LineCounter) indicating it handles multiple responsibilities. The class implements provider functionality while also managing position mapping, line counting, and position updates, suggesting it should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
