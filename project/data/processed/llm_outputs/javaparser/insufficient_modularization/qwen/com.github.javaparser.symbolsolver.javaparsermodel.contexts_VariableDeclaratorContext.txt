    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 14 lines of code (loc=14), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this class appears to be well-decomposed and focused on a single responsibility. The low complexity metrics and small size do not indicate insufficient modularization."
