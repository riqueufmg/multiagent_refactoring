{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.SourceFileInfoExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom) and a Weighted Method Count (wmc) of 38, indicating high complexity. With 145 lines of code (loc) and 8 fields (nof), the class encapsulates significant functionality that could benefit from decomposition. The low LCOM value (0.105) suggests cohesive methods, but the overall size and method count indicate insufficient modularization as the class handles multiple responsibilities without being broken down into smaller, more focused components."
