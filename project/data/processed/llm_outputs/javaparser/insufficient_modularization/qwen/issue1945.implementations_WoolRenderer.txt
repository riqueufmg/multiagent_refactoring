    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 methods (1 public), 7 lines of code, and a Weighted Method Count of 2. The low number of fields (1) and methods indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, focused implementation with manageable size and complexity."
