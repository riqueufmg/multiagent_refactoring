{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MethodReferenceExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 22 methods (nom=22, nopm=22) and 137 lines of code (loc=137), with a high weighted method count (wmc=36). The class directly depends on 12 external classes, indicating high complexity and potential violation of single responsibility principle. The high method count and lines of code suggest the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
