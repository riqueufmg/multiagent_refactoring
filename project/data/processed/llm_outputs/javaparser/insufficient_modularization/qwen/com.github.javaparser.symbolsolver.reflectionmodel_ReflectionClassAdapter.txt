{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionClassAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: WMC of 41 (high cyclomatic complexity), 14 methods with 13 being public (high number of methods), and 149 lines of code. The LCOM value of 0.0 suggests poor cohesion, and the class has 7 dependencies indicating high coupling. These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
