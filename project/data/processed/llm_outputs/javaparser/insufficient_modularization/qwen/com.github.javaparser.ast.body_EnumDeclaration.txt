    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.EnumDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=23, nopm=23) and a high Weighted Method Count (wmc=37), indicating high complexity. The Lines of Code (loc=134) also suggest a substantial size. The high LCOM value (0.5217391304347826) indicates weak cohesion among methods, suggesting that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce complexity and improve modularity."
