{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.StatementMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0), 11 lines of code (loc=11), and very low complexity (wmc=2). The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. The low number of classes in the file (nc=22) suggests appropriate modularization for its purpose."
