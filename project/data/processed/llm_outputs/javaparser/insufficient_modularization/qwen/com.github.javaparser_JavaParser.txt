    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavaParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=37, nopm=36) and a high Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=42), indicating high complexity. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low cohesion (lcom=0.81) further suggest that the class is not well decomposed and could benefit from modularization to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
