{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 34 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 16 with 13 private methods suggesting high internal complexity, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 188 which is substantial for a single class. The high number of private methods (13 out of 16) and significant lines of code suggest this class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
