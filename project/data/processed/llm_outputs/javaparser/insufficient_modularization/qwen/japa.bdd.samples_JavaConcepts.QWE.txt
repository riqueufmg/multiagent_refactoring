    "class": "japa.bdd.samples.JavaConcepts.QWE",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 44 lines of code (loc=44), and a depth of inheritance of 2 (dit=2). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0, nopf=0) and low field count indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or configuration class rather than a complex module requiring refactoring."
