{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.CompilationUnitGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 12 lines of code (loc=12), and a low weighted method count (wmc=4). The class has only 1 public method (nopm=1) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating minimal implementation complexity. The low number of methods and lines of code suggest the class is already well-decomposed and does not require further decomposition to reduce size or complexity."
