    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.AssertStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods which is not excessive for a statement node in an AST. The WMC of 30 indicates moderate complexity but not high complexity. The LCOM of 0.526 suggests reasonable cohesion. The class has only 2 fields and 113 lines of code, which is manageable. The DIT of 4 indicates moderate inheritance depth. While the class has multiple dependencies (9), this is typical for AST nodes that need to integrate with various visitor patterns and meta-model components. The metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization."
