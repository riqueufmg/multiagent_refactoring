    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6, wmc=6) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The lack of class dependencies (dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0) and low complexity (wmc=6) suggest it is already well modularized. While it has 1 field (nof=1), the overall size and complexity are not excessive enough to warrant further decomposition."
