    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.IntegerLiteralExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 8 lines of code (loc=8). The depth of inheritance tree is 5 (dit=5) which indicates it's part of a well-structured inheritance hierarchy. With minimal responsibilities and low complexity, this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it appears to be properly decomposed and focused on a single responsibility."
