{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.postprocessors.Java21PostProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code (loc=5), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and minimal structural complexity (wmc=0, nc=1). The depth of inheritance tree is 12 (dit=12) which indicates it inherits from a deep hierarchy, but this is not indicative of insufficient modularization within this class itself. With such minimal content and complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
