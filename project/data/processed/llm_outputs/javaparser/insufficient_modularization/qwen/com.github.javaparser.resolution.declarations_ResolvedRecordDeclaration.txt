    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedRecordDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7, wmc=7) and 33 lines of code (loc=33), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. With 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and only 3 inner classes (nc=3), the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The low method count and minimal complexity metrics suggest adequate modularization for its current scope."
