    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), 5 lines of code (loc=5), and cyclomatic complexity of 1 (wmc=1). All metrics indicate a very simple class that does not require further decomposition. The class is already well-modularized given its minimal functionality."
