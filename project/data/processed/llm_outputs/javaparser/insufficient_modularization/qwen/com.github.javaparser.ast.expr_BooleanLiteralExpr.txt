    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.BooleanLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 14 methods (nom=14) and 62 lines of code (loc=62), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 15 (wmc=15), showing low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class maintains good encapsulation. The Lack of Cohesion metric at 0.71 suggests reasonable cohesion. These metrics indicate that the class is sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
