    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypePatternDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4) and 19 lines of code (loc=19), which indicates a very small and simple class. With 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and only 2 nested classes (nc=2), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit complexity that would warrant further modularization. The low number of methods and lines of code suggest the class is appropriately sized and does not suffer from insufficient modularization."
