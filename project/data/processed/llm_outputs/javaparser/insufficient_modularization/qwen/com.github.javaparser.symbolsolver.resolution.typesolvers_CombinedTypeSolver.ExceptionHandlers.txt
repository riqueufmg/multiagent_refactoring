    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.CombinedTypeSolver.ExceptionHandlers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 5 fields and 5 public fields, 0 methods and 0 public methods, with 63 lines of code. While the LOC is relatively high for a class with no methods, the low number of fields and absence of methods suggests this is likely a simple data holder or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition. The lack of methods (WMC = 0) indicates minimal implementation complexity that would benefit from modularization."
