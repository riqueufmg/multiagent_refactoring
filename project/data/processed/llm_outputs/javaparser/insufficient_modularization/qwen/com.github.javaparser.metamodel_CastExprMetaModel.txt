    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.CastExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 2 fields (nof=2), and a very small size of 10 lines of code (loc=10). The weighted method count is minimal (wmc=1) and there are no complex dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class appears to be properly decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
