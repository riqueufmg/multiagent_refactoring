    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.changes.ListAdditionChange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (all public), 35 lines of code, and WMC of 6. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and DIT of 1 shows it's not deeply inherited. The low number of fields (3) and methods suggests appropriate size and complexity for a single class without need for further decomposition."
