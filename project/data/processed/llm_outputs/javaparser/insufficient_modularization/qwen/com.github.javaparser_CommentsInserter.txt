    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high Weighted Method Complexity (WMC=30) and a large number of methods (NOM=7) relative to its size (LOC=124), indicating complex implementation that could benefit from further decomposition. The class also has multiple dependencies (7 external classes) suggesting it handles diverse responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
