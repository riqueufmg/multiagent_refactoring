    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.StringEscapeUtils.OctalUnescaper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 44 lines of code (loc=44). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. While the class name suggests it might be doing octal unescaping, the metrics indicate it's likely a simple utility or placeholder class with minimal functionality that doesn't require further decomposition."
