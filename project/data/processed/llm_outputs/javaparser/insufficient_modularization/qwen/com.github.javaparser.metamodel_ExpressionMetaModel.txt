    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), indicating a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 25 nested classes (nc=25) and no fields or public fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already well-decomposed and maintains low complexity."
