{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.AssignExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 19 methods (nom), 27 weighted methods count (wmc), and 130 lines of code (loc). The high number of methods and weighted method complexity suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. LCOM value of 0.5789473684210527 indicates moderate lack of cohesion, supporting the need for better modularization."
