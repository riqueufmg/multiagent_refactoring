    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules.ModuleProvidesDirective",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom=21) and 114 lines of code (loc=114), which while substantial, does not indicate insufficient modularization given the class appears to be a cohesive AST node representing module provides directives. The WMC of 32 indicates moderate complexity but is reasonable for a class with this responsibility. The LCOM of 0.667 suggests good cohesion within the class. The class has appropriate inheritance depth (DIT=4) and no cyclic dependencies (NC=0), indicating proper modular design."
