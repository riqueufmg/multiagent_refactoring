    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.MethodResolutionLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 31 methods (nom=31) with a high weighted method count of 211 (wmc=211), indicating high complexity. The lines of code are 803 (loc=803), which is substantial for a single class. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.1935483870967742) may suggest that this class is doing too much and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
