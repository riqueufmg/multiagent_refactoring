    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6, wmc=6), 34 lines of code (loc=34), and minimal dependencies on 4 external classes. The low method count, low cyclomatic complexity, and small size do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
