    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.FunctionalInterfaceLogic",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods (nom=7) and weighted method count of 15 (wmc=15), which are within reasonable limits for a single class. The lack of fields (nof=2, nopf=0) and low lines of code (loc=64) suggest it's focused on a specific responsibility. The moderate LCOM value (0.5714285714285714) indicates reasonable cohesion, and the absence of fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggests it's not overly coupled. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality."
