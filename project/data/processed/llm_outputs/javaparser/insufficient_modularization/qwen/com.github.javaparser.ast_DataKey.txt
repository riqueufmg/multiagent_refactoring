    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.DataKey",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 16 lines of code (loc=16), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is also low, suggesting minimal complexity. With such few methods and low complexity, there is no indication that further decomposition would provide benefits. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its current size and functionality."
