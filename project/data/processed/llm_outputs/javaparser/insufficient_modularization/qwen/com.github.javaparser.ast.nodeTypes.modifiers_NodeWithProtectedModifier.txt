    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 11 lines of code (loc=11), and a low complexity (wmc=2). It follows the interface segregation principle with a focused responsibility of handling protected modifiers. The metrics indicate a well-modularized small interface with minimal complexity that does not require further decomposition."
