    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 fields and 4 public fields, with 129 lines of code. It has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low method count and simple structure indicate it is already well modularized as a data class or enum-like structure."
