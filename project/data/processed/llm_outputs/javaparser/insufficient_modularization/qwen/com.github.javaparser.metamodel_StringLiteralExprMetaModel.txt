    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.StringLiteralExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 0 fields (nof=0), 8 lines of code (loc=8), and a weighted method count of 1 (wmc=1). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple meta-model class with minimal responsibilities."
