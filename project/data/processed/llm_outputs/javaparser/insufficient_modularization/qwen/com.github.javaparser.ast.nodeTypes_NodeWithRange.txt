    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7) and 39 lines of code (loc=39), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=8) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 nested class (nc=1) and no fields (nof=0), the class appears to be well-focused and not overly complex. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's not heavily coupled, and the negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) indicates good cohesion. These metrics suggest the class is sufficiently modularized."
