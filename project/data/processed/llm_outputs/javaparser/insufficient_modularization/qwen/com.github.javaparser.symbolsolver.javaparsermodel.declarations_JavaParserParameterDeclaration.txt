    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserParameterDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 6 public), low lines of code (40), low weighted method count (9), and no class variables. The depth of inheritance (4) and lack of cohesion (0.0) are not problematic for this size. The dependencies are reasonable for a parameter declaration class and do not indicate excessive complexity or responsibility."
