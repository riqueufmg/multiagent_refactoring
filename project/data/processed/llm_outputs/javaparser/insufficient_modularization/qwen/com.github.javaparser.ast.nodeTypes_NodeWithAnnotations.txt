    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithAnnotations",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 20 methods (nom=20) and 147 lines of code (loc=147), indicating a relatively large and complex class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=20) confirms high implementation complexity. The class also has a high number of dependencies (7 external dependencies) suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities related to annotation processing. The high number of children (nc=28) indicates this class is widely extended, making its complexity impact more significant across the system. These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
