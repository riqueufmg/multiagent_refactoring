{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.BinaryExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18) and 26 weighted method count (wmc=26), with 127 lines of code (loc=127). The high number of methods and complexity suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The LCOM value of 0.5555555555555556 indicates moderate lack of cohesion, supporting that the class may contain responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
