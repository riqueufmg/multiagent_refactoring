    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 7 fields. The lines of code (loc=15) are minimal. The class appears to be a simple data structure or meta-model class with no signs of insufficient modularization. The low number of methods and fields suggests it is already well-decomposed for its purpose."
