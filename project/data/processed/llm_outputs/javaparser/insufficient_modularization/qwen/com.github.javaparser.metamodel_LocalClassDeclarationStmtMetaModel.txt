    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.LocalClassDeclarationStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=9, NOM=1) and minimal responsibilities. It has only 1 field, 1 public field, 1 method, and 0 public methods, indicating it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The low lines of code and single method suggest this class is appropriately sized and focused."
