    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserTypePatternDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5, nopm=5), 28 lines of code (loc=28), and Weighted Methods per Class of 5 (wmc=5). The Lack of Cohesion in Methods is 0.0 (lcom=0.0) indicating high cohesion. With only 2 fields and no public methods, the class appears to be well-focused on a single responsibility. The absence of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests limited coupling. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains reasonable size and complexity metrics."
