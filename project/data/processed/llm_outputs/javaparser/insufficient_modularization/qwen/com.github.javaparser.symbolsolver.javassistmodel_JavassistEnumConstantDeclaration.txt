    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistEnumConstantDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 7 weighted method count (wmc=7), and 30 lines of code (loc=30). The class has no fields (nof=3, nopf=0) and maintains good cohesion (lcom=0.0). The depth of inheritance tree is moderate (dit=4) and there are no external dependencies being used (fanin=0, fanout=0). The size and complexity are within acceptable limits for a well-modularized class."
