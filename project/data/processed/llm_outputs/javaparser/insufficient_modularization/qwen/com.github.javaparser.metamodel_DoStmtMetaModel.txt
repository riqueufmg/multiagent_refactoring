    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.DoStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal fields (nof=2), and low lines of code (loc=10). The lack of inheritance complexity (dit=3 but this is not excessive) and absence of coupling issues (fanin=0, fanout=0, lcom=0.0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple data structure or meta-model class with appropriate size and complexity for its purpose."
