{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.chunks.CommonValidators",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) with a low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=9), small size (loc=41), and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The low number of methods and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition is not necessary as the class is already sufficiently modularized."
