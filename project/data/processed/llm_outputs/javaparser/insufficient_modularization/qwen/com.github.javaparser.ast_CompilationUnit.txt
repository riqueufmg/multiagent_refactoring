{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=59, nopm=55), high lines of code (loc=615), and a high weighted method count (wmc=100), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) may also indicate poor decomposition and encapsulation."
