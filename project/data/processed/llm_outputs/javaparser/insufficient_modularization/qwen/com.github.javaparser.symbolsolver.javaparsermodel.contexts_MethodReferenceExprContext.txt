{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.MethodReferenceExprContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high WMC (29) indicating high complexity, a large LOC (120) suggesting it's doing too much, and a high number of dependencies (17 external classes) which indicates it's handling too many responsibilities. With only 4 methods but high complexity and dependencies, it suggests the class should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
