{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ExplicitConstructorInvocationStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom=24, nopm=24) and a high weighted method count (wmc=47), indicating high complexity. With only 4 fields (nof=4) and 184 lines of code (loc=184), the class is doing too much work and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high WMC suggests that the class has complex method implementations that would be better distributed across multiple specialized classes."
