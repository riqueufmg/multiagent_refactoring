{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.GenericVisitorGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (1 public), 12 lines of code, and a Weighted Method Count of 2. The Depth of Inheritance is 2 which is reasonable. With only 2 methods and low LOC, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
