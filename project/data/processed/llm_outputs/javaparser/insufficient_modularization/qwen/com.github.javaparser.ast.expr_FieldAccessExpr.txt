    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.FieldAccessExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 23 methods (nom=23, nopm=23) and 163 lines of code (loc=163), indicating high implementation complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=39) further confirms high complexity. With 3 fields (nof=3) and 13 dependencies, the class appears to have multiple responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
