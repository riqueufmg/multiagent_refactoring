{
    "class": "a.RefCycleClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 2 fields (nof=2), and 8 lines of code (loc=8). The lack of methods (nopm=1 indicates only 1 public method) and low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=1) suggest this is already a simple, well-decomposed class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
