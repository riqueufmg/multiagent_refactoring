    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 1 class attribute (nc=1) and no fields or public methods, this class appears to be properly modularized and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
