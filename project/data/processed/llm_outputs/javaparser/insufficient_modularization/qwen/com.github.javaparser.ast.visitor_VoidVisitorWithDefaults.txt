    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitorWithDefaults",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=105, nopm=105) and a high Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=105), indicating high complexity. The large number of dependencies (97 imported classes) suggests that the class handles too many responsibilities and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and low lines of code (loc=324) relative to the number of methods further supports that this class is doing too much with minimal state, which is a sign of Insufficient Modularization."
