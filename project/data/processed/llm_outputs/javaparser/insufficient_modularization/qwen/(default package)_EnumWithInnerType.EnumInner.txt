{
    "class": "(default package).EnumWithInnerType.EnumInner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods, 0 fields, and only 2 lines of code. There are no implementation details or dependencies that would indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple inner enum with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
