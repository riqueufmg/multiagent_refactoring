    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.metamodel.InitializeConstructorParametersStatementsGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 36 lines of code (loc=36), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=11) is also relatively low, suggesting the class is not overly complex. With no fields (nof=0) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be well-encapsulated. The lack of significant complexity metrics and small size suggest this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
