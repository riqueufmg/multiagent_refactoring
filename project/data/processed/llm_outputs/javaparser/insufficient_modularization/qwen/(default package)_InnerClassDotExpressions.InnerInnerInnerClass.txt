    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (0 methods, 0 fields, 5 lines of code, WMC=0) and no dependencies, indicating it is already sufficiently decomposed. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is minimal and does not contain any complex functionality that would benefit from further decomposition."
