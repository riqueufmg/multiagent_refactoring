    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=14), single method (NOM=1), no class-level attributes (NOF=6 but all are parameters, NOPF=6), no inheritance depth issues (DIT=2), no coupling problems (fanin=0, fanout=0), and good cohesion (LCOM=0.0). The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class with appropriate size and complexity for its purpose."
