    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.AcceptGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 18 lines of code (loc=18), and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=2, nc=0) and simple method structure (nopf=0, nopm=1) indicate proper modularization. The low LCOM value (0.0) suggests good cohesion, and the absence of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates limited complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
