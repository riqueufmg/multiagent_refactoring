    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.ConstructorResolutionLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 36 which is high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 145 indicating substantial size, and it has 6 methods with 3 public methods. The high WMC value suggests the class has complex internal logic that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The class also has multiple dependencies (5 external classes) which further suggests it might be doing too much and could be broken down to improve modularity and reduce complexity."
