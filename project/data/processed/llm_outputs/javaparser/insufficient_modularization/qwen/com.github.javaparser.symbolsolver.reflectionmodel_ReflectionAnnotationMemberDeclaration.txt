    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionAnnotationMemberDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with WMC of 12 and 5 methods, which is within acceptable limits for a single class. The LOC is 69 which is relatively small. The class has low coupling with fanin=0 and fanout=0, and LCOM=0.0 indicates good cohesion. The inheritance depth (DIT=4) is reasonable. The number of fields (3) and methods (5) are not excessive, and there's no indication that further decomposition would provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity."
