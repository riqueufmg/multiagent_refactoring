    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.SwitchEntryMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 6 fields, all of which appear to be property meta-model fields (nopf=6). The low WMC indicates simple method complexity, LCOM of 0.0 suggests good cohesion among the fields, and the small LOC count (14) indicates minimal implementation complexity. The class follows a clear pattern of having fields for meta-model properties with corresponding getters, which represents appropriate modularization for its purpose."
