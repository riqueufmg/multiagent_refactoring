    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.Generator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 10 methods (nom), 14 weighted method count (wmc), and 66 lines of code (loc). The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (lcom=0.6) suggest it's already reasonably decomposed. The single field (nof=1) and minimal public interface (nopf=0, nopm=1) indicate focused responsibility. While further decomposition could be possible, the current modularization appears sufficient for its size and complexity."
