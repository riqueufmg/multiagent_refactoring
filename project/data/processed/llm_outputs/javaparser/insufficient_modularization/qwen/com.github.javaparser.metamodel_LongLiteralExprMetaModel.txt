    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 8 lines of code (loc=8). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple meta-model class with minimal responsibilities."
