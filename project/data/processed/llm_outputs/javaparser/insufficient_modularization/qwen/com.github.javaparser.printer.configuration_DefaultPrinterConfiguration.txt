{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.DefaultPrinterConfiguration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods (nom=6, wmc=6) and 65 lines of code (loc=65), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and single inheritance level (dit=1) suggest simple structure. The low LCOM value (0.333) indicates good cohesion among methods. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be well-organized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
