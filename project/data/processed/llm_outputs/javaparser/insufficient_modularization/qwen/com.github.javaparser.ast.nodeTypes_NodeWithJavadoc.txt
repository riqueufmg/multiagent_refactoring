    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithJavadoc",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11, wmc=11) and 50 lines of code (loc=50), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The class has 9 nested classes (nc=9) but no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no public methods (nopm=0), suggesting it may be primarily an interface or abstract class defining behavior rather than implementing complex logic. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and minimal complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
