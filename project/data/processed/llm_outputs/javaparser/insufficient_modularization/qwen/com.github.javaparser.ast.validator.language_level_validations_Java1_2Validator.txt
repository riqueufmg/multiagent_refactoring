    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java1_2Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal lines of code (loc=12), single nested class (nc=1), and no field declarations (nof=2 includes inherited fields). The low method count, low cyclomatic complexity, and small size indicate sufficient modularization without need for further decomposition."
