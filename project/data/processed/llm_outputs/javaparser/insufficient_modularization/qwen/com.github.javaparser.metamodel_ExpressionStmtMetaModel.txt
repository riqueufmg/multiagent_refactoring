```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ExpressionStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), and a Weighted Method Count of 1 (wmc=1). The Lines of Code (loc=9) is minimal, and there are no dependencies to other classes except for PropertyMetaModel which suggests proper modularization. The Lack of Cohesion (lcom=0.0) indicates high cohesion, and the Depth of Inheritance (dit=3) is reasonable. These metrics indicate the class is well-modularized and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
