    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), and a Weighted Method Count of 1 (wmc=1). The Lines of Code is minimal at 9 (loc=9). With such low complexity and size, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its simple responsibility."
