{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.UnparsableStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11, nopm=11) and 42 lines of code (loc=42), which is within reasonable limits for a specialized AST statement class. The WMC of 11 indicates moderate complexity. The class has 4 levels of inheritance (dit=4) which is acceptable. The LCOM value of -1.0 suggests good cohesion among methods. The number of fields is 0 (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating the class is likely a simple data holder or utility. The fanin=0 and fanout=0 suggest limited external dependencies, which is appropriate for a leaf class in an AST hierarchy. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
