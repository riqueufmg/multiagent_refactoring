    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.TypeExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (38 total, 33 public), high lines of code (423), and a high weighted method count (128), indicating high complexity. The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it operates in isolation but does not imply good modularization. The high LCOM value (0.421) indicates weak cohesion among methods, and the depth of inheritance tree (2) is low, suggesting limited reuse of existing abstractions. These metrics collectively suggest the class is large and complex enough that further decomposition could reduce its size and implementation complexity."
