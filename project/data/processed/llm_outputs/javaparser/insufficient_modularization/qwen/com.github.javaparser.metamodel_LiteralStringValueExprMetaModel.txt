    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.LiteralStringValueExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 12 lines of code (loc=12), and a low weighted method count (wmc=2). The depth of inheritance tree is moderate (dit=4) and the lack of cohesion metric indicates good cohesion (lcom=1.0). With only 1 field and 1 public field, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
