    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.JavaParserTypeSolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 48 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 20 with 13 public methods suggesting a large interface, LOC (Lines of Code) is 232 indicating substantial implementation size, and it has 8 fields with complex dependencies to 9 external classes. The high method count and complexity suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
