    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedAnnotationMemberDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 weighted method count (wmc=1), 6 lines of code (loc=6), and no fields (nof=0). The low number of methods and minimal LOC indicate that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity. The class appears to be already sufficiently modularized given its small size and simple structure."
