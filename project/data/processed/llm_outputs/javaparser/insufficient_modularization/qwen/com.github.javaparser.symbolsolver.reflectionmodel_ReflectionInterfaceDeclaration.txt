    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionInterfaceDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (38 total, 30 public) and a high Weighted Method Count (WMC=70), indicating high complexity. The Lines of Code (312) further supports its large size. Although LCOM is low (0.184), suggesting good cohesion, the sheer size and method count indicate insufficient modularization as the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more manageable components."
