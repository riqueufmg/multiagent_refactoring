    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.bounds.CapturesBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (39 lines of code, 8 methods) and low complexity (WMC=11). The LCOM value of 0.375 indicates good cohesion, and with only 2 fields and no public fields, the class appears to be well modularized. The single dependency is appropriate for its purpose in type inference bounds."
