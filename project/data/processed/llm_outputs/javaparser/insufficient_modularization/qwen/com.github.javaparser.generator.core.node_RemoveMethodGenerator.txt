    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5), low lines of code (60), and low weighted method count (12), indicating it is already well modularized. The class does not exhibit high complexity or size that would suggest insufficient modularization. The dependencies are related to its functionality as a generator and do not indicate poor decomposition."
