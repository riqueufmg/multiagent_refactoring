    "class": "com.github.javaparser.AbstractCharStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 28 methods (nom), 79 weighted method count (wmc), and 344 lines of code (loc). The high number of methods and weighted method count suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
