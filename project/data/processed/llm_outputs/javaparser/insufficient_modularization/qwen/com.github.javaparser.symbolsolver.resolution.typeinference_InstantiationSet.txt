    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.InstantiationSet",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 8 being public (nopm=8), indicating a focused responsibility. The lines of code (loc=43) and weighted method count (wmc=12) are relatively low, suggesting manageable complexity. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.333) indicate good modularization. The class appears to be well-decomposed with a clear, limited responsibility."
