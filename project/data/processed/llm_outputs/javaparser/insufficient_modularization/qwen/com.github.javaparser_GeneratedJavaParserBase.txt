    "class": "com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserBase",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (35), high lines of code (345), and a high weighted method count (77), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The lack of inheritance (DIT=0) and low number of fields (2) suggest limited decomposition, while the high LCOM value (0.2857142857142857) indicates potential cohesion issues despite being below 0.5, the overall complexity metrics support the presence of the smell."
