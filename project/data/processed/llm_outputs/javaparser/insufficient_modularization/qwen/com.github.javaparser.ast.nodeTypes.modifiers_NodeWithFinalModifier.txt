    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.modifiers.NodeWithFinalModifier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 14 lines of code (loc=14), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 10 nested classes (nc=10) and no fields or public methods, this class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its simple purpose as a node type modifier interface."
