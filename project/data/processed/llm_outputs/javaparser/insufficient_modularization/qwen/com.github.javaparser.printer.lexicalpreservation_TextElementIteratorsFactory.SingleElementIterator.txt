    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElementIteratorsFactory.SingleElementIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, 16 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple iterator implementation with basic structure and no complex behavior that would benefit from additional modularization."
