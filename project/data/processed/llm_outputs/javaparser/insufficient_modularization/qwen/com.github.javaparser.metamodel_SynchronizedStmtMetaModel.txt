{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.SynchronizedStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal fields (nof=2), and low lines of code (loc=10). The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion, and the low DIT (3) suggests reasonable inheritance depth. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized with minimal complexity and clear responsibility."
