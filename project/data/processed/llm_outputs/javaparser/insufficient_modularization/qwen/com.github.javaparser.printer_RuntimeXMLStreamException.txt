    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.RuntimeXMLStreamException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is also low, suggesting minimal complexity. This class appears to be a simple exception class that is appropriately sized and does not require further decomposition."
