    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.TypeExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), and a Weighted Method Count of 1 (wmc=1). The Lines of Code is minimal at 9 (loc=9). There are no dependencies to other classes except for PropertyMetaModel which suggests proper modularization. The Lack of Cohesion metric is 0.0 (lcom=0.0) indicating good cohesion. The class appears to be sufficiently decomposed given its minimal functionality."
