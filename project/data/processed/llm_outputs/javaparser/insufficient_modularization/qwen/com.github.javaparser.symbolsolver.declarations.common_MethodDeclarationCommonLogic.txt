    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.declarations.common.MethodDeclarationCommonLogic",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 5 methods and WMC of 13, but lacks sufficient metrics indicating insufficient modularization. The class has low lines of code (55), no fields or constructors, and no inheritance hierarchy (DIT=0). While it has dependencies on 8 external types, this is typical for a utility/logic class. The low method count and moderate complexity do not clearly indicate the need for further decomposition."
