    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.CharLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15, wmc=15) and 71 lines of code (loc=71), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. With 0 fields (nof=0) and 0 public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to have a single responsibility. The depth of inheritance tree is 6 (dit=6), which is reasonable. The class has no direct dependencies on other classes in terms of fanin/fanout (both=0), suggesting it's relatively self-contained. Based on these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains a manageable size and complexity."
