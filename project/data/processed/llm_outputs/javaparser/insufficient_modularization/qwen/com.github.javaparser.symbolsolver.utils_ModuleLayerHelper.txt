    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils.ModuleLayerHelper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 45 lines of code (loc=45), with a low weighted method count (wmc=6). The low number of methods and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. There are no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies, suggesting a simple, focused utility class that is appropriately modularized."
