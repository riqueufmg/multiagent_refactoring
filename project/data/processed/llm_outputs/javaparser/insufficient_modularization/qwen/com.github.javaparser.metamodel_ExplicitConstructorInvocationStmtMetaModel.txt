    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ExplicitConstructorInvocationStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 5 fields (nof=5), and 13 lines of code (loc=13). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity metrics, indicates that the class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
