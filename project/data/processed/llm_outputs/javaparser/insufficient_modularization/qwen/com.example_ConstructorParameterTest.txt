    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), 3 fields (nof=3, nopf=0), and very low complexity (wmc=1, loc=10). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure indicates it is already well modularized. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is small and simple."
