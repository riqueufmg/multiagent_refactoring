    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionTypeParameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods with a WMC of 21, which indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. The LOC is 72 which is reasonable for a class with this functionality. The LCOM value of 0.1818181818181818 suggests good cohesion within the class. The class has 3 fields and 0 public fields, indicating proper encapsulation. The DIT of 4 shows reasonable inheritance depth. Based on the metrics provided and analyzing the class in isolation, the complexity and size do not indicate insufficient modularization."
