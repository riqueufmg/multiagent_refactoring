    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.ReceiverParameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 17 methods and WMC of 31, but LCOM value of 0.35 indicates good cohesion. With only 3 fields and 128 lines of code, the class size is reasonable. The class appears to be well-modularized with appropriate responsibilities for representing receiver parameters in Java AST nodes."
