{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.Value",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5, nopm=5) and 28 lines of code (loc=28), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=5), and there are only 2 fields (nof=2). The low LCOM value (0.4) suggests good cohesion within the class. These metrics indicate that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
