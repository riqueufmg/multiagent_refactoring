    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.TypeCastingGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods and WMC of 10, but LCOM value of 0.333 suggests good cohesion. With only 60 lines of code and reasonable method distribution (6 total methods with 1 private), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
