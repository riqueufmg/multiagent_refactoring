{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedClassDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 6 methods (nom=6), 32 lines of code (loc=32), and a low weighted method count (wmc=6). The depth of inheritance tree is moderate (dit=4) and there are no fields (nof=0) or parameters (nopf=0, nopm=0). The low method count and lines of code indicate the class is already well modularized and does not require further decomposition."
