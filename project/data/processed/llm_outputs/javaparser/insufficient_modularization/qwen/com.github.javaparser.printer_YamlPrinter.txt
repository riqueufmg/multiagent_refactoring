    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods (4 public) and WMC of 15, which is acceptable for a printer class. With only 55 lines of code and 2 fields, the class is relatively small. The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (dit=0, lcom=0.0) suggests it's already well-decomposed for its purpose. No clear indication that further decomposition would significantly reduce size or complexity."
