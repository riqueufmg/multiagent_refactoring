    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 67 methods (nom=67) with 61 public methods (nopm=61), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 91 (wmc=91), which is high and suggests high complexity. With 460 lines of code (loc=460) and only 5 fields (nof=5), this class appears to be doing too much and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The high method count and complexity suggest insufficient modularization."
