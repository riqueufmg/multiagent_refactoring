    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.NodeMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 2 fields (nof=2), and a low weighted method count (wmc=2). The lines of code (loc=12) are minimal, indicating proper decomposition. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest this class is appropriately modularized for its functionality."
