{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithVariables.Helper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 14 lines of code (loc), no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), and no dependencies. The lack of methods results in undefined complexity metrics (wmc=0, lcom=-1.0) which indicates minimal functionality. Given the helper class pattern and the extremely small size, this appears to be appropriately modularized for its current functionality."
