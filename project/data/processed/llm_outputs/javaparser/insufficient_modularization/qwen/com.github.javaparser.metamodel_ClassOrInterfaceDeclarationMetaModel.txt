    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ClassOrInterfaceDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 5 fields, with very low complexity (wmc=1). The LOC is 13 which is very small. There are no complex dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and the class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration class with minimal responsibilities. The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity and size, indicates this class is already well modularized and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
