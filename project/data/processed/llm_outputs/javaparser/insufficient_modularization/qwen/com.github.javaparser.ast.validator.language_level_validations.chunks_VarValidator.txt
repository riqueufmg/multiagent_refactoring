```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.chunks.VarValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 17 weighted method count (wmc=17), 73 lines of code (loc=73), and depth of inheritance of 1 (dit=1). The lack of fields (nof=1) and low method count indicate it is already well modularized. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion within the class."
