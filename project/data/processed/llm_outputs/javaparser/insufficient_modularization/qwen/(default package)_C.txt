    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 field, 1 public field, 0 methods, and 3 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and the class serves a simple purpose with minimal responsibilities. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already sufficiently decomposed."
