    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javadoc.JavadocBlockTag",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom) and 84 lines of code (loc), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc) is 17, indicating moderate complexity. With 5 fields (nof) and no public fields (nopf), the class maintains good encapsulation. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it is a focused, standalone class that is appropriately modularized for its responsibilities."
