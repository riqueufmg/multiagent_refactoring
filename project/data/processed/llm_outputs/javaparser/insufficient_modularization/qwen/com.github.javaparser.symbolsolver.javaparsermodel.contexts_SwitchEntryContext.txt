    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.SwitchEntryContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 4 methods with WMC of 14, indicating moderate complexity. With 53 lines of code and 4 public methods, the class is reasonably sized and does not exhibit excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition. The lack of fields (nof=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest focused responsibility. LCOM of -1.0 indicates good cohesion among methods. DIT of 2 shows shallow inheritance, and the class appears to have a single, well-defined purpose within the context provided."
