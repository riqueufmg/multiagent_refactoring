{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 20 methods (nom=20) with 16 public methods (nopm=16), high Weighted Method Count (wmc=29), and 135 lines of code (loc=135). The high number of methods and complexity metrics indicate the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
