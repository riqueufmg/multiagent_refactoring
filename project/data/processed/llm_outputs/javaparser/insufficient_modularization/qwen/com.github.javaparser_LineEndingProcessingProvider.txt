    "class": "com.github.javaparser.LineEndingProcessingProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (94 loc, 8 methods) and complexity (WMC=17) for its functionality. The LCOM value of 0.25 indicates good cohesion, and with only 7 fields and no inheritance (DIT=1), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
