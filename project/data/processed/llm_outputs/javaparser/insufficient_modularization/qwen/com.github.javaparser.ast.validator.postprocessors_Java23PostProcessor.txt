    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.postprocessors.Java23PostProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), and only 5 lines of code (loc=5). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating no computational complexity. With no methods or fields, there is no meaningful decomposition possible, and the class is already at minimal size and complexity. The DIT of 14 indicates inheritance depth but does not indicate insufficient modularization in this case."
