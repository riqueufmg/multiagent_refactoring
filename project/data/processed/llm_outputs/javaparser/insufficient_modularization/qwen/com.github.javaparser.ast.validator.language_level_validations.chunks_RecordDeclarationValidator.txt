    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 1 public method (nopm=1), with a low weighted method count (wmc=7). The lines of code (loc=32) indicate a small class size. With a depth of inheritance tree of 1 (dit=1), it's not part of a complex inheritance hierarchy. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and low complexity metrics suggest adequate modularization for its current scope and responsibilities."
