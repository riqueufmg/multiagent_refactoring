    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no inheritance hierarchy (dit=2 but nc=0), this class appears to be appropriately modularized for its simple purpose. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) further suggest this class is sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
