{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.TypePatternExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17, nopm=17) and 106 lines of code (loc=106), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 28, indicating moderate complexity but not excessive. The class has 2 fields (nof=2) which is minimal. The LCOM value of 0.588 suggests reasonable cohesion. While the class has multiple dependencies (10 external classes), this is typical for AST node classes that need to integrate with various parts of the system. The metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class size and complexity are within acceptable ranges."
