{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.CommentMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0), 12 lines of code (loc=12), and a low weighted method count (wmc=2). The class has minimal complexity with only 3 nested classes (nc=3) and a low depth of inheritance (dit=2). The lack of fanin and fanout indicates limited coupling, and the LCOM value of 1.0 suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
