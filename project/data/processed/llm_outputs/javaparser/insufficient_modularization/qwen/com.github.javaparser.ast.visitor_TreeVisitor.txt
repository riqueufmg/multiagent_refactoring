    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.TreeVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6, nopm=6) and 55 lines of code (loc=55), with a low weighted method count (wmc=9). These metrics indicate a relatively small and simple class that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization, which typically involves classes that are excessively large or complex and would benefit from further decomposition."
