{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.other.BndGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), low complexity (wmc=4), and only 30 lines of code (loc=30). The lack of fields (nof=0) and low method count indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused generator class with appropriate size and complexity for its purpose."
