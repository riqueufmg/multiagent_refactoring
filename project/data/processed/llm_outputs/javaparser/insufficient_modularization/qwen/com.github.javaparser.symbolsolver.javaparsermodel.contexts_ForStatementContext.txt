    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods (nom=6, nopm=6) and 65 lines of code (loc=65) with a moderate weighted method count (wmc=16). The depth of inheritance tree is 3 (dit=3) and it has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). While the class has some complexity, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would clearly warrant further decomposition. The class appears to have a focused responsibility related to for statement contexts based on its name and dependencies."
