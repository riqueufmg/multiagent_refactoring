    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ReceiverParameterMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 3 fields (nof=3), and 11 lines of code (loc=11). The depth of inheritance is minimal (dit=2) and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond PropertyMetaModel. The class appears to be properly decomposed with focused responsibilities."
