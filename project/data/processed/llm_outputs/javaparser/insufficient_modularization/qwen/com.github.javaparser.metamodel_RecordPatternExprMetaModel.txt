    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.RecordPatternExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 2 fields (nof=2), and 10 lines of code (loc=10). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current functionality."
