{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.IfStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom=24, nopm=24) and 154 lines of code (loc=154), with a high weighted method count (wmc=38). The class directly depends on 10 different classes, indicating high complexity and responsibilities. The high number of methods and lines of code, combined with significant dependencies, suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
