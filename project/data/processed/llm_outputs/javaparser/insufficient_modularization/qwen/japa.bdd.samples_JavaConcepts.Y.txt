    "class": "japa.bdd.samples.JavaConcepts.Y",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (0 methods, 0 fields, 14 lines of code, WMC=0) and no dependencies, indicating it is already minimally decomposed rather than insufficiently modularized. Insufficient Modularization typically applies to classes that are overly complex and could benefit from further decomposition, which is not the case here."
