    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 fields and 0 methods, with 32 lines of code. The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal complexity. Without methods, there is no behavior to decompose further. The class appears to be a simple data holder or configuration object rather than a complex class requiring further modularization."
