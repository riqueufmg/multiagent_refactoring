    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.PhantomNodeLogic",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=6, LOC=38, NOM=4) and minimal dependencies (2 external dependencies). The low WMC indicates simple method complexity, the small number of methods (4) and lines of code (38) suggest the class is already well-decomposed and manageable in size. LCOM=0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class."
