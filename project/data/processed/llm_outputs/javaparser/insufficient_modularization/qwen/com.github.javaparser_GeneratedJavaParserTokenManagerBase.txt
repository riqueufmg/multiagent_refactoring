    "class": "com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserTokenManagerBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 59 lines of code (loc=59), with a relatively low weighted method count (wmc=14). The low number of methods and moderate size do not indicate insufficient modularization. There are no public methods (nopm=0, nopf=0) which suggests proper encapsulation, and the class appears to be a generated base class with minimal complexity that does not require further decomposition."
