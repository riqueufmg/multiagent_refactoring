{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 25 methods (nom=25) and 144 lines of code (loc=144), which are within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=26) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would require decomposition. The class has only 2 nested classes (nc=2), which is not problematic. The lack of fields (nof=0) and parameters (nopf=0, nopm=0) suggests a well-focused design. While the class has dependencies on 7 other classes, this is typical for a declaration interface in a parser library and doesn't indicate insufficient modularization."
