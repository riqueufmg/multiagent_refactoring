```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.StringEscapeUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4), reasonable size with 257 lines of code, and good cohesion (lcom=1.0). The presence of nested classes (LookupTranslator, CharSequenceTranslator) suggests appropriate decomposition. The low number of fields (nof=10) and methods indicates the class is not overly large or complex, and the modularization appears sufficient for its functionality."
