    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistMethodLikeDeclarationAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods (nom=7) and weighted method count of 14 (wmc=14), which is within acceptable limits for a single class. The lines of code (loc=65) is relatively small. While the class has 4 fields (nof=4) and 7 method parameters (nopm=7), these metrics do not indicate excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to have a cohesive responsibility as a method-like declaration adapter."
