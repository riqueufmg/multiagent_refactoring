    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ArrayAccessExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16, nopm=16) and 89 lines of code (loc=89), which represents a moderate size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 23 (wmc=23), indicating moderate complexity. The class has a reasonable number of fields (nof=2) and no static fields (nopf=0). The Lack of Cohesion metric is 0.625 (lcom=0.625), which is acceptable. The class has 9 dependencies, which is reasonable for a class in the AST expression hierarchy. The Depth of Inheritance is 4 (dit=4), which is within acceptable limits. The class appears to be well-focused on representing array access expressions in the AST, with appropriate responsibilities for an AST node."
