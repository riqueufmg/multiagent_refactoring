    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithModifiers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods with a WMC of 17, which indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would suggest insufficient modularization. The LOC is 66, which is relatively small. The class has 14 nested classes (nc) but no fields or public fields, suggesting it may be an interface or utility-like structure. Without evidence of overly complex responsibilities or clear decomposition opportunities, insufficient modularization cannot be confirmed."
