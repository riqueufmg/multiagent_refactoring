    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (32), a high weighted method count (134), and a large number of lines of code (530), indicating high implementation complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The lack of decomposition into smaller, more manageable units is evident from these metrics, which exceed typical thresholds for maintainability and complexity."
