    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TokenTextElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom) and 78 lines of code (loc), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc) is 26, indicating moderate complexity. The Lack of Cohesion metric (lcom) is 0.25, suggesting good cohesion among methods. The Depth of Inheritance Tree (dit) is 2, which is acceptable. While the class has a relatively high number of public methods (nopm=18), the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
