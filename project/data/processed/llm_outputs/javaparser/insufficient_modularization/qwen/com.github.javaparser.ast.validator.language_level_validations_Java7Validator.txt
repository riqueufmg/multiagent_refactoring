    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal lines of code (loc=30), single nested class (nc=1), and no field declarations (nof=2 refers to inherited fields). The low method count and complexity metrics indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
