    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.DefaultPrinterConfiguration.ConfigOption",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 36 lines of code (loc=36). The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple configuration option class with minimal functionality."
