    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), and a Weighted Method Count of 1 (wmc=1). The Lines of Code is minimal at 9 (loc=9) and it has no lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0). The class appears to be properly decomposed with no evidence of insufficient modularization."
