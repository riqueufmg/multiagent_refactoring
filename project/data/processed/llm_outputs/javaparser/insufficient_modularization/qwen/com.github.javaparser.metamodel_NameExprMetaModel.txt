```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.NameExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), and very few lines of code (loc=9). The Weighted Method Count (wmc=1) indicates minimal complexity. With only 1 public method and 1 public field, the class is already highly decomposed. The low DIT (3) suggests reasonable inheritance depth, and LCOM (0.0) indicates good cohesion. The class size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
