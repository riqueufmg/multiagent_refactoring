    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.AnnotationMemberDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom=24, nopm=24) and 169 lines of code (loc=169), with a high weighted method count (wmc=44). The large number of methods and high complexity indicate that the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
