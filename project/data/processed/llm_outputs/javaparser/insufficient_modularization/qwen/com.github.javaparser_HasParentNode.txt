    "class": "com.github.javaparser.HasParentNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 8 methods (nom), 61 lines of code (loc), and weighted method count of 11 (wmc). The depth of inheritance tree is 1 (dit) indicating no inheritance hierarchy. With only 2 nested classes (nc) and no fields or public methods, the class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its size and complexity."
