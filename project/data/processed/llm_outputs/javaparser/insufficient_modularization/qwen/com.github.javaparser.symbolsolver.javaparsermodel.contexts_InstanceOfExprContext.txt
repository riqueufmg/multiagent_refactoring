    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.InstanceOfExprContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 32 lines of code (loc=32), with a low weighted method count (wmc=7). The class implements a single, focused responsibility related to instance-of expression contexts. The low number of methods and moderate complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization - the class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
