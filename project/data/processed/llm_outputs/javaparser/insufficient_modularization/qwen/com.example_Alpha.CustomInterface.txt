    "class": "com.example.Alpha.CustomInterface",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 lines of code (loc=2) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), indicating it is already sufficiently decomposed. The lack of methods (wmc=0, nom=0) and minimal size suggest this interface is simple enough that further decomposition would not provide benefits. No signs of insufficient modularization are present given the extremely simple nature of this class."
