    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ForStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 22 methods (nom=22) and 45 weighted method count (wmc=45), with 167 lines of code (loc=167). The high number of methods and complexity indicators suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The class also has a moderate LCOM value of 0.4545454545454545, indicating some cohesion issues that could be improved through better modularization."
