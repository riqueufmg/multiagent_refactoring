    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserVariableDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods and WMC of 10, but LCOM value of 0.25 indicates good cohesion. With only 44 lines of code and 3 fields, the class size is reasonable. The low number of methods (8) and relatively low WMC suggest the class is not overly complex and does not require further decomposition."
