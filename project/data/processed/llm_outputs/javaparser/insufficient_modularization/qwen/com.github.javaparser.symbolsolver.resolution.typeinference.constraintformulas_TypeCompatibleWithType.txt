{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.constraintformulas.TypeCompatibleWithType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5), 3 fields (nof=3), and a low weighted method count (wmc=15). The lines of code (loc=59) are relatively small, and the lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it is already well modularized. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class."
