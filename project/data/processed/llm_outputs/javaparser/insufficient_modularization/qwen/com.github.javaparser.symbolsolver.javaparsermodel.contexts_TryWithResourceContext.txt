    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.TryWithResourceContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 5 methods (nom=5) and weighted method count of 20 (wmc=20). The lines of code (loc=57) and method count are within reasonable limits for a single class. While the class has a depth of inheritance of 3 (dit=3), this alone does not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to have a focused responsibility related to try-with-resources context handling based on its name and dependencies. No clear evidence of excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
