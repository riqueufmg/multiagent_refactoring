    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.chunks.NoUnderscoresInIntegerLiteralsValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 public methods (nopm=2), 15 lines of code (loc=15), and weighted method count of 4 (wmc=4). The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and low method count indicate proper modularization. The depth of inheritance tree is moderate at 3 (dit=3) and there are no internal dependencies (nc=0) suggesting appropriate decomposition."
