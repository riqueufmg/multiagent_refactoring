{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.postprocessors.Java10PostProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 4 weighted method count (wmc=4), 29 lines of code (loc=29), and 2 public methods (nopm=2). The low method count, low cyclomatic complexity, and small size indicate sufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
