    "class": "japa.bdd.samples.JavaConcepts.Enum",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 15 lines of code (loc=15), and a WMC of 0. The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple enum with basic structure that does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization."
