{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.EscapeSequences",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=13), and low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current scope and complexity."
