    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=8), low number of classes (nc=6), and low weighted method count (wmc=1). The class appears to be sufficiently modularized with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
