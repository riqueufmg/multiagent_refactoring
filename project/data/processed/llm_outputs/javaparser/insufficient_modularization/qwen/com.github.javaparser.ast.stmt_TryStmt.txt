    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.TryStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 46 and 23 methods (NOM), indicating it handles too many responsibilities. The LOC is 168 which is substantial for a single class, and it has 4 fields with no private fields, suggesting potential data clumping. The class also has a depth of inheritance (DIT) of 4, which combined with its high method count, indicates it may benefit from further decomposition to improve modularity and reduce implementation complexity."
