    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.PatternExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13, nopm=13) and 66 lines of code (loc=66), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=17) is moderate, and the Lack of Cohesion metric (lcom=0.6923076923076923) suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to be well-encapsulated. The depth of inheritance tree (dit=5) is reasonable and doesn't indicate excessive complexity. The class seems appropriately modularized for its size and complexity."
