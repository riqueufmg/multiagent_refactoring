    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MarkerAnnotationExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12, nopm=12) and 46 lines of code (loc=46), which represents a moderate size. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 12, indicating reasonable complexity. The DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) is 5, suggesting appropriate inheritance usage. With 9 dependencies, the class has reasonable coupling. The LCOM value of -1.0 indicates good cohesion. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to be of manageable size and complexity."
