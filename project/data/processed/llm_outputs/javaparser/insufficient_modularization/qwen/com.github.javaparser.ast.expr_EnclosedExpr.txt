    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.EnclosedExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15, nopm=15) and 77 lines of code (loc=77), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=19) is moderate, and the Lack of Cohesion metric (lcom=0.667) suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to have a clear, single responsibility. The depth of inheritance (dit=4) is reasonable. These metrics suggest adequate modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
