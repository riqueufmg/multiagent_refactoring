    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.PrettyPrintVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=122, nopm=107), high lines of code (loc=1588), and a very high weighted method count (wmc=346), indicating high complexity and insufficient modularization. These metrics suggest the class should be further decomposed to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
