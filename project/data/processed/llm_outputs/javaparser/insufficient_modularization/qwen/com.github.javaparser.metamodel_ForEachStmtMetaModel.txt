{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ForEachStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal fields (nof=3), and small size (loc=11). The low WMC indicates simple implementation complexity, and the small number of fields and methods suggest appropriate modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the class appears to be properly focused with no evidence of insufficient decomposition."
