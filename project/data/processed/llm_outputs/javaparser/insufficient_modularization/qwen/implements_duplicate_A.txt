    "justification": "Class has minimal complexity with 0 methods, 0 fields, and only 4 lines of code. WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and DIT of 3096 appears to be a data error or anomaly since typical DIT values are much lower. The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization as it contains no functionality to decompose."
