    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithMembers",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 37 methods (nom=37) and 309 lines of code (loc=309), indicating high size and complexity. With 37 methods and only 2 nested classes (nc=2), the class lacks proper decomposition. The high WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) value of 37 further confirms the high implementation complexity. The class has numerous dependencies (12 external classes) suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. These metrics collectively indicate that the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
