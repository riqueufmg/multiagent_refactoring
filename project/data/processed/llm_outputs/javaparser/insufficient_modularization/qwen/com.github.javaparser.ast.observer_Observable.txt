    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.Observable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 17 lines of code (loc=17), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no fields (nof=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
