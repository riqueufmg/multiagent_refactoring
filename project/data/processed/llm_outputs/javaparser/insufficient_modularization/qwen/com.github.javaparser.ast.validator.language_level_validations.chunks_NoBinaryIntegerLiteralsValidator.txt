{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.chunks.NoBinaryIntegerLiteralsValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 public methods (nopm=2), 15 lines of code (loc=15), and weighted method count of 4 (wmc=4). The depth of inheritance tree is moderate at 3 (dit=3). These metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
