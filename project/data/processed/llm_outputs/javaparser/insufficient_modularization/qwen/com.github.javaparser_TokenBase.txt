    "class": "com.github.javaparser.TokenBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0), 13 lines of code (loc=13), and a single nested class (nc=1). The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or base class with limited responsibilities."
