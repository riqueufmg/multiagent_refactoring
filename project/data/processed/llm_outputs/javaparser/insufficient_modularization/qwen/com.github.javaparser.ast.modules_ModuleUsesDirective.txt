    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (91 LOC, 19 methods) and complexity (WMC=25) for its functionality as a module directive. The LCOM value of 0.7368421052631579 indicates good cohesion within the class. With only 1 field and 4 levels of inheritance depth, the class does not exhibit excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
