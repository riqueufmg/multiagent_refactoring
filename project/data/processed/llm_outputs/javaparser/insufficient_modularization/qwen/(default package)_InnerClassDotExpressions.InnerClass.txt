    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 15 lines of code (loc), 0 methods (nom), 0 fields (nof), and a WMC of 0. The class appears to be a simple inner class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. There are no indicators of high complexity or size that would suggest insufficient modularization."
