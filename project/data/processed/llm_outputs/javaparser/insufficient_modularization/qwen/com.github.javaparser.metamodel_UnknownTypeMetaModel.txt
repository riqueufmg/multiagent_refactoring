    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.UnknownTypeMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 8 lines of code (loc=8). The low number of methods and fields indicates it is already well decomposed. No fan-in or fan-out dependencies suggest it has clear, simple responsibilities. The low complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
