    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElementMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 0 fields (nof=0), and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With such a small size and low complexity, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed."
