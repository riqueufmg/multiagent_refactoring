    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 1 public field, 0 methods, 0 public methods, 3 lines of code, and a WMC of 0. The low number of methods and fields indicates that the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit the characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
