    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) and 66 lines of code (loc=66), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=18) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to have reasonable responsibilities. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it's not taking on responsibilities that should be elsewhere. While the class has several methods, its size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
