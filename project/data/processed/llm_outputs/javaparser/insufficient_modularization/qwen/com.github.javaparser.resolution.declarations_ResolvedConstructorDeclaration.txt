    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 10 lines of code (loc=10), indicating it is already well-decomposed and minimal in size. The low complexity metrics (wmc=1, dit=3) suggest proper modularization without excessive complexity that would require further decomposition."
