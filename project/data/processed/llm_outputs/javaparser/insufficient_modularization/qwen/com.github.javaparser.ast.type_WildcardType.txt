    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.WildcardType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 25 methods (nom=25, nopm=25) and 167 lines of code (loc=167), which while substantial, does not indicate insufficient modularization given that all methods are public and likely serve the class's core responsibilities. The WMC of 42 indicates moderate complexity but is not excessive. The class appears to be a well-defined AST node type with appropriate cohesion (LCOM=0.48) and reasonable size for its purpose as a wildcard type representation in a parser library."
