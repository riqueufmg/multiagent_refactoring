    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithThrownExceptions",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 methods (nom=8) and 45 lines of code (loc=45), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=8) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 3 dependencies and no fan-in or fan-out, the class appears to have a focused responsibility and limited complexity, not warranting further decomposition."
