    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.ChildTextElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom) with 18 public methods (nopm), but the WMC (Weighted Method Count) is 23 which indicates moderate complexity. The LCOM value is 0.476 which suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 73 lines of code (loc) and 1 field (nof), the class is relatively small and focused. The DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) is 2, indicating a simple inheritance structure. While the class has a moderate number of methods, its size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a cohesive, focused class with manageable complexity."
