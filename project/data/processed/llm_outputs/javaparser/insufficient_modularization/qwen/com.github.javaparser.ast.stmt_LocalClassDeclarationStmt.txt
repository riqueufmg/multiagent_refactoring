    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.LocalClassDeclarationStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 70 lines of code (loc=70), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=18) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests this class is relatively isolated and not heavily interconnected. The DIT value of 4 indicates a reasonable inheritance depth. While the LCOM value of 0.714 suggests some cohesion issues, the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
