    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.InferenceVariableType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with WMC of 25 and 11 methods, but it's a specialized type resolution class that appears to be appropriately focused on its single responsibility. The low LCOM value (0.1818181818181818) indicates good cohesion among methods, and with only 94 lines of code, it doesn't exhibit the excessive size that would indicate insufficient modularization. The class has no public fields (nopf=0) and reasonable method distribution, suggesting proper internal organization."
