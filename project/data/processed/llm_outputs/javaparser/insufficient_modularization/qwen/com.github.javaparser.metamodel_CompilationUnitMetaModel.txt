    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1) and 4 fields, all of which appear to be property meta-models (nopf=4, nof=4). The low WMC and LCOM values (0.0) indicate good cohesion and simplicity. The class has minimal size (loc=12) and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple data class with appropriate decomposition."
