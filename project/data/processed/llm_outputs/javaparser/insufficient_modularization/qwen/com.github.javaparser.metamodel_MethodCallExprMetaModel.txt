    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), small size (loc=13), and minimal responsibilities (nof=5, nopf=5). The low number of fields and methods indicates proper modularization without excessive complexity that would require further decomposition."
