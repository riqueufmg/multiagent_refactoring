{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ClassOrInterfaceType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 31 methods (nom=31, nopm=31) and 211 lines of code (loc=211), indicating high implementation complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=54) further confirms high complexity. With 15 dependencies and 5 levels of inheritance depth (dit=5), the class appears to have too many responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
