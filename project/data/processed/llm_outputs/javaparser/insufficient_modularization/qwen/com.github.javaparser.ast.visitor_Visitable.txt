    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0), low complexity (wmc=2), and minimal size (loc=18). It serves as a simple interface with visitable functionality that delegates to visitor implementations. The low number of methods and complexity indicate sufficient modularization for its purpose."
