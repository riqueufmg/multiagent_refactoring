    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Difference.EnforcingIndentationContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, 11 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as there is no evidence of functionality that could be further decomposed into separate modules or classes."
