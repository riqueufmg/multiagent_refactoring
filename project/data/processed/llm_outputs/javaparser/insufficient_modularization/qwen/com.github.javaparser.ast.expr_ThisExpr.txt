    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ThisExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18, nopm=18) and 93 lines of code (loc=93), which is within reasonable size limits for a well-encapsulated class. The WMC (Weighted Method Count) of 26 indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) value of 0.611 suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0), the class appears to have focused responsibilities. The DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) of 4 indicates normal inheritance depth. The class seems appropriately modularized for its responsibilities."
