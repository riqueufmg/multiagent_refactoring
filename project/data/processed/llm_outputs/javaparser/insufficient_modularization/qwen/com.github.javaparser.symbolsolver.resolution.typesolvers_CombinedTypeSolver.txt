    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.CombinedTypeSolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC=29 (high cyclomatic complexity), NOM=15 (many methods), NOF=9 (many fields), and LOC=214 (large size). The class implements multiple responsibilities as a type solver with combined functionality, containing exception handling inner classes and cache management, suggesting it could be further decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
