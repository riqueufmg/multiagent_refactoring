    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 0 methods, 3 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple interface or data structure that is already sufficiently modularized."
