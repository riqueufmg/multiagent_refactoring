    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarators.ParameterSymbolDeclarator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 2 public methods (nopm=2), 13 lines of code (loc=13), and weighted method count of 2 (wmc=2). These metrics indicate a very small and simple class that is already well-decomposed. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and low complexity suggest this class is appropriately modularized for its functionality."
