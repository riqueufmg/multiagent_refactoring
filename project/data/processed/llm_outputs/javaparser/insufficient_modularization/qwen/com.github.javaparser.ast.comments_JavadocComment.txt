    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.JavadocComment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (36 LOC, 10 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=10, DIT=4). While it has 8 dependencies, this is not excessive given its role as a specialized AST node for Javadoc comments. The low number of fields (NOF=0) and parameters (NOPF=0, NOPM=10 across all methods) suggests reasonable decomposition. No clear indication of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
