    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistAnnotationDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18, nopm=18) and 80 lines of code (loc=80), which represents a moderate size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=20) indicates reasonable complexity. The Lack of Cohesion metric (lcom=0.3888888888888889) suggests acceptable cohesion. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to be reasonably focused and decomposed appropriately for its functionality as an annotation declaration adapter."
