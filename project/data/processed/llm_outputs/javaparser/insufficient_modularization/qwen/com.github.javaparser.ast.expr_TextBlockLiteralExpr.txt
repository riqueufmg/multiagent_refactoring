    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.TextBlockLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom) and 15 public methods (nopm), with a WMC of 21 indicating moderate complexity. The LOC is 105 which is reasonable for a class with this functionality. The DIT of 6 suggests appropriate inheritance depth. While the class has some complexity, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its responsibilities."
