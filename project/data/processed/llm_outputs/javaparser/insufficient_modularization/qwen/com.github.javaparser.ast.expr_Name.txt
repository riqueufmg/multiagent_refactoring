{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Name",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19, nopm=19) and 115 lines of code (loc=115), with a weighted method count of 29 (wmc=29). The high number of methods and lines of code, combined with dependencies on 8 other classes, suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity. The class appears to have multiple responsibilities including node management, visitor patterns, metadata handling, and utility functions, indicating insufficient modularization."
