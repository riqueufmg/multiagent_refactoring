    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithIdentifier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 3 nested classes (nc=3) and no fields (nof=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The class size and complexity are appropriately low for its functionality."
