    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=0), low lines of code (loc=10), low Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=1), and no lack of cohesion (lcom=0.0). The class appears to be sufficiently modularized with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
