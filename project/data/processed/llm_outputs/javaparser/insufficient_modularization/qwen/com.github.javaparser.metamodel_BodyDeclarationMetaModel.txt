    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BodyDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=2, LOC=12, NOM=2) and only 1 field with 1 public field, indicating it is already well-decomposed. The class has minimal responsibilities with only 7 nested classes/fields and shows good cohesion (LCOM=1.0). There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears appropriately sized and structured."
