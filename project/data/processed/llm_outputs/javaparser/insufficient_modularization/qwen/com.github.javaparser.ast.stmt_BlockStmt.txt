    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.BlockStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15) and 83 lines of code (loc=83), which are within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=23) indicates moderate complexity but not excessive complexity that would warrant decomposition. The lack of fields (nof=1) and parameters (nopf=0) suggests a focused responsibility. The class appears to be a well-contained statement node in the AST with appropriate complexity for its purpose."
