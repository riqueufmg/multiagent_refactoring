{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.range.B",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), 5 lines of code (loc=5), and very low complexity (wmc=1). These metrics indicate a highly cohesive and simple class that does not require further decomposition. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests minimal functionality that does not warrant modularization."
