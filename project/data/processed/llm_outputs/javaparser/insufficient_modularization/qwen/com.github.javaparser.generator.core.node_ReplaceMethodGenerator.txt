    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.ReplaceMethodGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (48 LOC) and moderate complexity (WMC=10, NOM=4). While it has multiple dependencies (8 external classes), this is typical for generator classes that need to interact with various AST node types. The low number of methods (4 total, 1 public) suggests focused responsibility, and there's no indication of excessive complexity or size that would warrant further decomposition."
