    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.LineComment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13, nopm=13) and 49 lines of code (loc=49), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 13, suggesting moderate complexity. The class has a DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) of 4, indicating reasonable inheritance depth. With no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this appears to be a simple, well-focused class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
