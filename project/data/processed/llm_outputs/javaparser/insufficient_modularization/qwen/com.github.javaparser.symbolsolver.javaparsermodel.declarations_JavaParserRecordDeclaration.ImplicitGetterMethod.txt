    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0), and only 55 lines of code (loc=55). With minimal functionality and low complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already sufficiently decomposed."
