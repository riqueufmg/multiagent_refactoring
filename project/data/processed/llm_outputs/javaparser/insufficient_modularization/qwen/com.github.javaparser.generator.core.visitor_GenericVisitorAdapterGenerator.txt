{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.GenericVisitorAdapterGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), low weighted method count (wmc=5), and minimal lines of code (loc=27). The class has only 1 public method (nopm=1) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating proper decomposition. The depth of inheritance (dit=2) is reasonable and there are no signs of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
