    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules.ModuleDirective",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 44 methods (nom=44, nopm=44) and 131 lines of code (loc=131), indicating high implementation complexity. The high method count suggests the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. With a Weighted Method Count (wmc=44) equal to the method count, this suggests each method may be simple, but the overall class complexity remains high due to the sheer number of methods, supporting further decomposition to achieve better modularization."
