    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=103) and a high Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=103), indicating high complexity. It also has a large number of dependencies (99) which suggests it is responsible for visiting many different types of AST nodes, implying it could be further decomposed into smaller, more cohesive classes to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
