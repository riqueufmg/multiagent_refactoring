    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=103, wmc=103), indicating high complexity and responsibility. The large number of dependencies (97 unique classes) suggests that this class interacts with many other types, increasing its complexity and reducing cohesion. The lack of fields (nof=0) and private fields (nopf=0) may indicate that the class is not properly encapsulating state, potentially leading to procedural-style code. The high method count and extensive dependencies suggest that the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more cohesive modules to reduce size and implementation complexity."
