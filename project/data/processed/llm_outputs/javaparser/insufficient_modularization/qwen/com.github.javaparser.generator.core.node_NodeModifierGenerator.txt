    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 1 public method (nopm=1), with a very low cyclomatic complexity (wmc=2) and only 8 lines of code (loc=8). The lack of fields (nof=0) and low complexity metrics indicate this class is already well modularized and does not require further decomposition."
