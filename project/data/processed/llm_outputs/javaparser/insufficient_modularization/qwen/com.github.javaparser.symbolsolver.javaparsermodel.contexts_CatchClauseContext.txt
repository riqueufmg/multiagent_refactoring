    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (6 total, 6 public), low lines of code (36), low weighted method count (9), and low depth of inheritance (2). These metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a focused, single-responsibility component with appropriate size and complexity."
