    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.DifferenceElementCalculator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 52 and LOC of 253, indicating it is doing too much. It has 11 methods but only 1 is public, suggesting poor decomposition. The class manages multiple responsibilities including difference calculation, node text handling, and lexical preservation operations. LCOM of 0.4545454545454545 indicates moderate lack of cohesion, and the class depends on 9 different types, showing it has too many responsibilities and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
