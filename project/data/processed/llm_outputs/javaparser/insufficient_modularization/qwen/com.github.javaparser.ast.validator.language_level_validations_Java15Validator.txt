    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java15Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=10), single method (NOM=1), and minimal responsibilities (NOF=0, NOPF=0). The depth of inheritance tree is high (DIT=18) but this indicates it's part of a well-structured inheritance hierarchy rather than insufficient modularization. The class appears to be properly focused with no evidence of needing further decomposition."
