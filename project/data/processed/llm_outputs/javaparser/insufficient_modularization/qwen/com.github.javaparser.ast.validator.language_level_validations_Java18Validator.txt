    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), very low complexity (wmc=1), small size (loc=9), and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The low number of methods and minimal complexity indicate that further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
