    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MatchAllPatternExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 15 methods and WMC of 23, but this is appropriate for its role as an AST expression node. The LCOM value of 0.667 indicates reasonable cohesion, and the low fan-in/fan-out (0) suggests it's a specialized, well-contained class. The 83 lines of code and 5 levels of inheritance depth are within acceptable ranges for this type of domain-specific class."
