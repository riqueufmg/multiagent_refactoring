    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), small size (loc=11), and minimal responsibilities (nof=3, nopf=3). The low WMC and LCOM values indicate good cohesion and simplicity. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality as a meta-model class."
