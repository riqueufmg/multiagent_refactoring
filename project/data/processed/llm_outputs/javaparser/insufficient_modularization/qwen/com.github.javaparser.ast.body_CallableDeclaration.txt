    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.CallableDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC of 71 (high cyclomatic complexity), 30 methods with 25 private methods suggesting large implementation size, and 293 lines of code. The high number of methods and complexity suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
