    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionMethodDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19, nopm=19) and 84 lines of code (loc=84), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=25) indicates reasonable complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no static fields (nopf=0), the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization. The low LCOM value (0.2105263157894736) suggests good cohesion among the methods."
