    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.LabeledStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17, nopm=17) and 92 lines of code (loc=92), which while substantial, does not indicate insufficient modularization given the class appears to be a specialized AST node for labeled statements. The WMC of 24 indicates moderate complexity but is reasonable for a class handling labeled statement functionality. The DIT of 4 suggests appropriate inheritance depth, and LCOM of 0.588 indicates reasonable cohesion. The class seems appropriately scoped for its purpose as a labeled statement representation in an AST."
