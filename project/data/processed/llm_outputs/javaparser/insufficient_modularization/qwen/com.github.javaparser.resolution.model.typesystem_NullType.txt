{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem.NullType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 7 methods (nom), 6 public methods (nopm), 27 lines of code (loc), and a low weighted method count (wmc=7). The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=1) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused type system representation with appropriate size and complexity for its purpose."
