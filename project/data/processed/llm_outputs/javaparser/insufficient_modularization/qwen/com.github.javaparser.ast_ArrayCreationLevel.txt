    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.ArrayCreationLevel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) and 30 weighted method count (wmc=30), indicating high complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) but 16 methods, the class appears to have too many responsibilities for its limited data. The high WMC suggests complex method implementations, and the class has 111 lines of code (loc=111) which is substantial for a class with only 2 fields. The LCOM value of 0.375 indicates some cohesion issues, and the class has significant dependencies (10 external dependencies) suggesting it may be doing too much work that could be decomposed into separate modules."
