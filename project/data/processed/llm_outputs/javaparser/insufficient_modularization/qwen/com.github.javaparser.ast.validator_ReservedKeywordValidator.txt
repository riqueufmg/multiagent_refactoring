    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.ReservedKeywordValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=5, LOC=23, NOM=3) and no inheritance depth issues (DIT=3 is reasonable). It has zero fan-in and fan-out dependencies, suggesting it's already well-decomposed. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the small number of methods and fields suggest appropriate modularization."
