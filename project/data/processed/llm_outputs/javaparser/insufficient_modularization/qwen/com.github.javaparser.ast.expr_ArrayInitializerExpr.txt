    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ArrayInitializerExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15, nopm=15) and 83 lines of code (loc=83), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=23) indicates reasonable complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no static fields (nopf=0), the class maintains a focused responsibility. The lack of inheritance complexity (dit=4) and reasonable lack of cohesion (lcom=0.667) suggest proper modularization. The class has no fan-in or fan-out dependencies, indicating it's relatively self-contained. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class appears to have appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
