    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.DefaultConfigurationOption",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 methods (nom=11) with 10 public methods (nopm=10), but the WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 16 which indicates moderate complexity. The class has only 62 lines of code (loc=62) and 2 fields (nof=2). The LCOM value is 0.0 indicating good cohesion. While the class has a moderate number of methods, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition. The low DIT (1) suggests it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy, and the zero fan-in/fan-out indicates limited external dependencies."
