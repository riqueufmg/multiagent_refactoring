{
    "class": "main.Parent.ParentNested",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 lines of code (loc=2), zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0), zero fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and zero complexity metrics (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0). The class appears to be a minimal nested class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization since it lacks the complexity and size that would require further decomposition."
