    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.Utils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 26 methods (nom=26) with 25 being public (nopm=25), indicating a large interface. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 53 (wmc=53), suggesting high implementation complexity. With 230 lines of code (loc=230) and no fields (nof=0), this utility class appears to be a collection of unrelated methods that could be further decomposed into more cohesive, smaller classes based on functional responsibilities."
