{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.postprocessors.Java13PostProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code (loc), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and minimal structural complexity (wmc=0, nc=1). The low size and complexity metrics indicate that further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits, and the class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current scope."
