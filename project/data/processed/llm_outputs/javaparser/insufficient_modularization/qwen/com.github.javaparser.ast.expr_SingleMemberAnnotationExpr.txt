    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.SingleMemberAnnotationExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 14 public methods (nopm=14), with a WMC of 18 indicating moderate complexity. The LCOM value of 0.714 suggests good cohesion within the class. With only 69 lines of code (loc=69) and 5 levels of inheritance (dit=5), the class appears to be reasonably sized and well-structured. The single field (nof=1) and no public fields (nopf=0) indicate proper encapsulation. The class does not exhibit signs of being overly complex or large enough to require further decomposition."
