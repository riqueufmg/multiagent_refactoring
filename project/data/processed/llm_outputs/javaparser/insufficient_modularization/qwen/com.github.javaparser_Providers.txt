    "class": "com.github.javaparser.Providers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) and 62 lines of code (loc=62), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The weighted method count (wmc=13) indicates low complexity. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.333) suggest the class is focused and well-contained. While the class contains multiple provider-related methods, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition."
