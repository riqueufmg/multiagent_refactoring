    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code (loc), no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), and minimal structural complexity (wmc=0, dit=13 but this is inheritance depth not complexity, nc=1). The class appears to be a simple, lightweight class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed or serves a very specific minimal purpose."
