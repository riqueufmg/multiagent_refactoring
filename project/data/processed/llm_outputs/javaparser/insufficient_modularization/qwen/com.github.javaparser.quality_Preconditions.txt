    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) with 40 lines of code (loc=40) and a low weighted method count (wmc=6). The low number of methods and moderate size indicate sufficient modularization. No complex dependencies or high complexity metrics suggest the need for further decomposition."
