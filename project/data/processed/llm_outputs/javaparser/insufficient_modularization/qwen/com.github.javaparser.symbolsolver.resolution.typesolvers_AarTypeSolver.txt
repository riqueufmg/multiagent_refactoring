    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (34 LOC, 7 methods) and moderate complexity (WMC=9). The LCOM value of 0.4285714285714285 suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 1 field and 7 methods, the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would indicate insufficient modularization. The metrics suggest a well-contained, focused class with appropriate cohesion and manageable complexity."
