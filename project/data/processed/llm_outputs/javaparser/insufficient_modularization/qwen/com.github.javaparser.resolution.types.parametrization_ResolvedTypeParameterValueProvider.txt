    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 38 lines of code (loc=38), which indicates a relatively small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=10) is also low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 nested class (nc=1) and no fields (nof=0), the class does not exhibit characteristics of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
