    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (39 total, 29 public), a high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) value of 108, and a large Lines of Code (LOC) count of 494. These metrics indicate high complexity and size, suggesting that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its implementation complexity and improve modularity."
