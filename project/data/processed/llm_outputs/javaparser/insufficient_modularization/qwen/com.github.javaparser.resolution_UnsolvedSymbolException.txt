    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.UnsolvedSymbolException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 methods (nom=6, nopm=6) and 39 lines of code (loc=39), which indicates a relatively small and focused class. The lack of fields (nof=3, nopf=0) and low complexity (wmc=6) suggest it is already well-decomposed. The class appears to be a simple exception class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
