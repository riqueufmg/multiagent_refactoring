    "class": "com.github.javaparser.TokenMgrException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods (nom=6) and 96 lines of code (loc=96), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=16) indicates reasonable complexity. With only 6 fields (nof=6) and a lack of internal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The LCOM value of 0.667 suggests some cohesion issues but is not severe enough to indicate insufficient modularization given the overall moderate scale of the class."
