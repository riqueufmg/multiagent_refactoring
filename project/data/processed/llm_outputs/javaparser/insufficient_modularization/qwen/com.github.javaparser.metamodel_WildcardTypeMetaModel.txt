{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.WildcardTypeMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=1, LOC=10, NOM=1) and minimal dependencies (only 1 dependency on PropertyMetaModel). The low number of fields (NOF=2), methods (NOM=1), and lack of inheritance complexity (DIT=3 but this is reasonable for meta-model classes) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple data structure or meta-model class with minimal responsibilities, which is appropriate for its size and complexity."
