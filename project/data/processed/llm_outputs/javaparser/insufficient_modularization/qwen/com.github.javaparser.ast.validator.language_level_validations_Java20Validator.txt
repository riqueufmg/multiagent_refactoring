    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java20Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=9, NOM=1) and no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0), indicating it is already well decomposed. The class implements a single method with minimal functionality, which is appropriate for its purpose as a validator. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is simple and focused."
