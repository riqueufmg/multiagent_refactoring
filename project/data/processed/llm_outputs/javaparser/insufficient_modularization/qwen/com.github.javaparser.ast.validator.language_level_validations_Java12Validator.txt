    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=9), and minimal complexity metrics (wmc=1). The class appears to be sufficiently modularized given its simple responsibilities and low complexity. No further decomposition would provide meaningful benefits for size or implementation complexity reduction."
