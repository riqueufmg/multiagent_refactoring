    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.TryStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 4 fields which is reasonable for a meta-model class, and 12 lines of code. The lack of inheritance depth issues (dit=3 is moderate) and good cohesion (lcom=0.0) indicate sufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data structure for meta-modeling purposes with appropriate size and complexity."
