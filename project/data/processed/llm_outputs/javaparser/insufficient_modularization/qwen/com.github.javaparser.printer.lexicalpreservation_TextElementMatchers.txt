    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElementMatchers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4) and 16 lines of code (loc=16), which indicates a small and simple class. With 0 fields (nof=0) and only 2 public methods (nopm=2), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit complexity that would require further modularization. The low method count and small size suggest sufficient modularization has been achieved."
