    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14, nopm=14) and 156 lines of code (loc=156), which is within reasonable limits for a builder class. The weighted method count (wmc=16) indicates moderate complexity. The class has low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and good cohesion (lcom=0.0). While it depends on multiple TypeSolver implementations, this is appropriate for a builder pattern that needs to support various solver types. The size and complexity are justified by its role as a builder coordinating different type solvers."
