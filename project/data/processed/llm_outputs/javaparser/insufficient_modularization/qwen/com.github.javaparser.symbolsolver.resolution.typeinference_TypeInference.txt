{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeInference",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=21), a high weighted method count (wmc=69), and a large lines of code (loc=277), indicating high complexity and potential for decomposition. The lack of depth of inheritance (dit=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom≈0.14) suggest that the class is not benefiting from inheritance and has relatively high internal cohesion, but the sheer size and method count indicate that further modularization could reduce complexity."
