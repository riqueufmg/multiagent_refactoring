{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.BodyDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=62, nopm=61), high lines of code (loc=211), and high weighted method count (wmc=70), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The class likely contains too much responsibility and could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
