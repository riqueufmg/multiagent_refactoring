    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=13), single method (NOM=1), and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). While DIT=13 indicates deep inheritance, this reflects appropriate specialization rather than insufficient modularization. The class appears to be properly decomposed with focused responsibility."
