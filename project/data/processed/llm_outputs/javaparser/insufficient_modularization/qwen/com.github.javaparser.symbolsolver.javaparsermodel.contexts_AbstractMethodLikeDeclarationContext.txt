    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with WMC of 18 and 6 methods, but shows good modularization with clear separation of concerns. The LOC is 58 which is reasonable for an abstract class, and it has appropriate inheritance depth (DIT=2). The class appears to be well-focused on its responsibility as an abstract method-like declaration context."
