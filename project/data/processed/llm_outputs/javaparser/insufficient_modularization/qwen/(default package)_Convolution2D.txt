    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 lines of code (loc=2) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies. The low WMC (0) and absence of class members indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
