{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ContinueStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17, nopm=17) and 93 lines of code (loc=93), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=25) indicates reasonable complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no static fields (nopf=0), the class maintains a focused responsibility. The lack of direct dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and moderate LCOM value (0.588) suggest reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be sufficiently decomposed for its purpose as a statement node in the AST."
