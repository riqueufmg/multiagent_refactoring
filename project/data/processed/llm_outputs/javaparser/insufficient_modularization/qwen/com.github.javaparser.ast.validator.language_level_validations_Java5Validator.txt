{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java5Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), small size (loc=46), single nested class (nc=1), and no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion. While it inherits from a deep hierarchy (dit=8), the class itself is sufficiently simple and well-contained, showing no signs of insufficient modularization."
