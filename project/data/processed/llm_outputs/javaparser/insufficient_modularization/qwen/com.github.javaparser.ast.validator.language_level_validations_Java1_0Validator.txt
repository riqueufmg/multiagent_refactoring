    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 30 fields (nof=30) and 125 lines of code (loc=125) but only 1 method (nom=1), indicating high complexity and insufficient decomposition. The high number of fields relative to methods suggests the class is doing too much and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
