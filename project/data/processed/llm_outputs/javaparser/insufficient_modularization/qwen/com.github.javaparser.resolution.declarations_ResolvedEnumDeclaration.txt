    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedEnumDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 19 lines of code (loc=19), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 3 nested classes (nc=3) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class is already well-decomposed. The depth of inheritance tree (dit=4) is moderate and does not indicate excessive inheritance complexity."
