    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmSequence",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 6 weighted method count (wmc=6), and 21 lines of code (loc=21). It has a simple structure with no fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and no class dependencies (nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The low method count and complexity metrics indicate sufficient modularization has been achieved."
