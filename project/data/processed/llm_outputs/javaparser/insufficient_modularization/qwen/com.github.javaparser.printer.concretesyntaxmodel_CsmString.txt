{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmString",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, nopm=4) and 17 lines of code (loc=17), with a low weighted method count (wmc=4). The class directly inherits from Object (dit=1) and has no children (nof=1). While it has some dependencies (fanout=0, but dependencies list shows 3 external dependencies), the size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization - the class appears appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
