    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.SynchronizedStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16, nopm=16) and 89 lines of code (loc=89), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=23) indicates reasonable complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no static fields (nopf=0), the class maintains a focused responsibility. The lack of class-level dependencies (nc=0) and low fan-in/fan-out metrics suggest it's well-contained. The LCOM value of 0.625 indicates reasonable cohesion, and the depth of inheritance (dit=4) is acceptable. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its purpose as a statement node in an AST."
