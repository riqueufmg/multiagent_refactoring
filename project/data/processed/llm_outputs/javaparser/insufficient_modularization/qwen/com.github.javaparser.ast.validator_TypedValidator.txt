{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.TypedValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 3 fields (nof=0 indicates no fields but nc=3 suggests 3 components), low WMC (3), and small size (18 LOC). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity metrics, indicates sufficient modularization has been achieved."
