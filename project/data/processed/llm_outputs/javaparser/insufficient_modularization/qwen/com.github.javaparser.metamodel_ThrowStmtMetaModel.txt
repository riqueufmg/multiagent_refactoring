    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ThrowStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), and very low lines of code (loc=9). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 1 (wmc=1), indicating very simple implementation. The class appears to be a specialized meta-model class with appropriate single responsibility, and its size and complexity are proportionate to its functionality. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already appropriately decomposed for its simple purpose."
