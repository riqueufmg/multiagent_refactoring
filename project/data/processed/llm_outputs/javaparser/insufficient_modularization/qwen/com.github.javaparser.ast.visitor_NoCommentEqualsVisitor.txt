{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.NoCommentEqualsVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=109, nopm=104), high lines of code (loc=702), and a very high weighted method count (wmc=366). The large number of dependencies (97) indicates it handles many different types. The high LCOM value (0.761) suggests poor cohesion, and the lack of fields (nof=1) combined with many methods implies it may be doing too much work without proper decomposition. These metrics indicate the class is overly complex and could benefit from further modularization."
