{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.VarTypeMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 0 fields (nof=0), 8 lines of code (loc=8), and a Weighted Method Count of 1 (wmc=1). The low number of methods and fields indicates that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple meta-model class with minimal responsibilities."
