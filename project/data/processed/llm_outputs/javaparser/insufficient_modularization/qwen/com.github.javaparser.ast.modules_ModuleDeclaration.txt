{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules.ModuleDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 20 methods (nom=20) and 38 weighted method count (wmc=38), with 144 lines of code (loc=144). The high number of methods and complexity suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The class also has 11 dependencies, indicating it has multiple responsibilities and could be broken down into smaller, more focused modules."
