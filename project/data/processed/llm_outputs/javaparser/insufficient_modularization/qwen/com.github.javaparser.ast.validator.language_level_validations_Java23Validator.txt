    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java23Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and 8 lines of code (loc=8) with minimal complexity (wmc=1). The low number of methods and fields, combined with the small size and simple structure, indicates this class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
