{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.ObjectIdentityEqualsVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=104, nopm=104) and a high Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=104), indicating high complexity. The large number of dependencies (100+ AST node types) suggests the class is handling too many responsibilities without being decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low cohesion (lcom=1.0) further support that this class could benefit from further modularization to reduce its size and complexity."
