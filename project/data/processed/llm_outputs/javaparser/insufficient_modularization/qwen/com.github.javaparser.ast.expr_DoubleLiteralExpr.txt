    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.DoubleLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14, nopm=14) and 57 lines of code (loc=57), which represents a moderate size. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=14) is also moderate. With no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no class-level dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this appears to be a simple, focused class representing a double literal expression in an AST. The Depth of Inheritance Tree (dit=6) indicates it's part of a well-structured inheritance hierarchy. The class seems appropriately modularized for its purpose as a specialized AST node."
