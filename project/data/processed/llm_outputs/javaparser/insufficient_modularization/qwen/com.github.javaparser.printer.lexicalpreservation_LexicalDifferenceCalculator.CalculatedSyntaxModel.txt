    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalDifferenceCalculator.CalculatedSyntaxModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 weighted method count (wmc=0), and only 29 lines of code (loc=29). The lack of methods and low size indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or placeholder rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
