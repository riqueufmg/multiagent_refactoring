    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.SimpleName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (48 LOC, 10 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=11). While it has 10 methods which is at the higher end for a well-modularized class, the low LCOM value (0.6) indicates good cohesion among the methods. The class appears to be a simple data class with minimal functionality that is appropriately focused on its core responsibility."
