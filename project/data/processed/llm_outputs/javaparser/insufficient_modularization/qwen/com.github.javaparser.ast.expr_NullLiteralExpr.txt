```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.NullLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 10 methods (nom=10, wmc=10), 40 lines of code (loc=40), no fields (nof=0), and no fan-in or fan-out dependencies. The low number of methods and lines of code indicate that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
