    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4) and 45 lines of code (loc=45). The weighted method count (wmc=7) indicates low method complexity. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and no package dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
