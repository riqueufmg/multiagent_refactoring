    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 2 lines of code (loc=2). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies or coupling metrics indicating complexity. This class is too small and simple to exhibit insufficient modularization as it essentially contains no functionality to decompose further."
