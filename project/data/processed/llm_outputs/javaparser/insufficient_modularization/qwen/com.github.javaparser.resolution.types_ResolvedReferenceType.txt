    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedReferenceType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 51 methods (nom=51) and 42 public methods (nopm=42), with a high weighted method count (wmc=100), indicating high complexity. The large number of methods and high WMC suggest the class could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. With only 5 fields (nof=5) and 377 lines of code (loc=377), the class is doing too much relative to its data storage, indicating insufficient modularization."
