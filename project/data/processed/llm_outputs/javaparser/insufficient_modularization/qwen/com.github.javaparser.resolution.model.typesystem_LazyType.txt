{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem.LazyType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom=21, nopm=21) and 70 lines of code (loc=70), indicating high implementation complexity. The high number of methods suggests the class may not be completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity. WMC of 22 also indicates high complexity."
