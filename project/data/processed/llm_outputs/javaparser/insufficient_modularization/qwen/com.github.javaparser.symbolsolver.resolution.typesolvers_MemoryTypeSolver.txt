    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.MemoryTypeSolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (48 LOC, 8 methods) and low complexity (WMC=14). The LCOM value of 0.25 indicates good cohesion, and with only 2 fields and no public fields, the class appears to be well modularized. The low number of methods and fields suggests it has a single, focused responsibility."
