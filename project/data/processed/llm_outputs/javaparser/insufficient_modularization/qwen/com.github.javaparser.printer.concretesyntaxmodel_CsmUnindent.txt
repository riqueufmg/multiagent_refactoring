{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmUnindent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates a very small and simple class. With a low depth of inheritance (dit=1) and no fields (nof=0), the class appears to be well-decomposed and focused on a single responsibility. The size and complexity metrics suggest adequate modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
