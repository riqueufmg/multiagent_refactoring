    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Modifier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (nom=24) and 106 lines of code (loc=106), which is within reasonable limits for a well-modularized class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 25, indicating moderate complexity. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) is 0.875, which is high but not necessarily indicative of insufficient modularization as it may reflect the nature of the class being a data holder or enum-like structure. The class has a DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) of 3, suggesting proper inheritance usage. With only 2 fields and no public fields, the class appears to be well-encapsulated. The fanin and fanout are both 0, indicating this class may be relatively isolated, but this doesn't indicate insufficient modularization."
