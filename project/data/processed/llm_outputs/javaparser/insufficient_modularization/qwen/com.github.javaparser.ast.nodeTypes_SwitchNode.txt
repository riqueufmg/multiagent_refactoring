    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.SwitchNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 20 lines of code (loc=20), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=10) is low, suggesting low complexity. The class has only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no fields (nof=0), indicating a simple structure. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests limited coupling. Based on these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains a reasonable size and complexity level."
