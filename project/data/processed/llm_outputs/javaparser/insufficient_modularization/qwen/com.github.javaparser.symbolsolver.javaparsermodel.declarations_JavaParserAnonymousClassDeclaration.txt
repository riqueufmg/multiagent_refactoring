    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserAnonymousClassDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (25 total, 24 public) and a high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) of 30, indicating high complexity. The Lines of Code (LOC) count is 112, which is relatively high for a single class. The class also has a high fanout (0 reported but 14 dependencies listed) indicating it depends on many other classes, suggesting potential functionality that could be decomposed. The combination of high method count, high WMC, and numerous dependencies suggests the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
