    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmAttribute",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5), 16 weighted method count (wmc=16), and 48 lines of code (loc=48). It has a single field (nof=1) and no static fields (nopf=0). The low method count, moderate WMC, and single responsibility pattern suggest appropriate modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion among methods."
