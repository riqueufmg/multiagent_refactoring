    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Removed",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15) with a weighted method count of 23 (wmc=23), indicating high complexity for a single class. The lines of code at 75 (loc=75) suggests substantial implementation complexity that could benefit from decomposition. The class has 14 private methods (nopm=14) out of 15 total methods, indicating significant internal functionality that could potentially be extracted into separate, more cohesive modules. The low lack of cohesion metric (lcom=0.2666666666666666) further supports that the class may contain responsibilities that could be better separated."
