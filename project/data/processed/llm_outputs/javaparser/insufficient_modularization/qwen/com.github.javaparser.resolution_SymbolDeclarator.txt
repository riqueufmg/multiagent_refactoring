    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.SymbolDeclarator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 6 lines of code (loc=6), and 1 inner class (nc=1). The lack of fields (nof=0) and minimal method count indicates it is already well-decomposed. There are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggesting simple functionality. The low DIT (0) and LCOM (-1.0) values further support that this class does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
