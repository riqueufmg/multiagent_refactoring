    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.LongLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 15 methods (nom) and 20 weighted method count (wmc), 89 lines of code (loc) which is reasonable for a specialized expression class. The lack of fanin/fanout suggests it's not heavily interconnected. While it has some dependencies, the metrics don't indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
