    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.FieldDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), small size (loc=11), and minimal responsibilities (3 fields, 3 public fields). The low LCOM value (0.0) indicates good cohesion, and the inheritance depth (dit=3) is reasonable. The class appears to be sufficiently decomposed for its current responsibilities."
