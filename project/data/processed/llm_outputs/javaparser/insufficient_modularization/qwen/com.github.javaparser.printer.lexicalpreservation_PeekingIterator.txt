    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.PeekingIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom) and 26 weighted method count (wmc) which indicates moderate complexity. With only 139 lines of code (loc) and 4 fields (nof), the class is relatively small and manageable. The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low complexity metrics (lcom=0.0, nc=0) suggest it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
