    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorMap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods with 72 lines of code, which is within reasonable size limits. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 13, indicating moderate complexity. LCOM value of 0.23 suggests reasonable cohesion. The class has only 4 fields and no public fields, indicating proper encapsulation. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization as the size and complexity are within acceptable ranges for a utility class."
