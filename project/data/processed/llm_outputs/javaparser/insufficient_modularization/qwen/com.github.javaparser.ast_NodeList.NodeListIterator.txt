    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList.NodeListIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 fields (nof=2) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 58 lines of code (loc=58). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0, nopf=0) and low complexity metrics indicate this is a simple data structure or placeholder class rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further modularization."
