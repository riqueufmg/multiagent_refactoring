    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PatternExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 2 fields (nof=1 + nopf=1), and low lines of code (loc=12). The weighted method count (wmc=2) indicates simple method complexity. The depth of inheritance (dit=4) and lack of direct dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it's a well-contained, simple class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
