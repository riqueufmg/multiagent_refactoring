    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistConstructorDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) with all being public (nopm=13), indicating a well-focused interface. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 13, which is moderate and suggests reasonable complexity. The LCOM value of 0.3076923076923077 indicates good cohesion among the methods. With only 49 lines of code (loc=49) and 3 fields (nof=3), the class maintains a manageable size. The depth of inheritance tree (dit=4) is reasonable, and the lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests the class is not overly coupled. These metrics indicate sufficient modularization with appropriate separation of concerns."
