    "class": "(default package).B",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, and 10 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies on other classes that would suggest poor modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder with minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition."
