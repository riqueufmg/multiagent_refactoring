    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.UnknownType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 15 methods (nom=15, nopm=15) and 64 lines of code (loc=64), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=16) indicates reasonable complexity. With 8 dependencies and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class appears to be reasonably focused. The lack of class-level dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and zero nested classes (nc=0) suggests good encapsulation. While further decomposition could theoretically be possible, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant classification as Insufficient Modularization."
