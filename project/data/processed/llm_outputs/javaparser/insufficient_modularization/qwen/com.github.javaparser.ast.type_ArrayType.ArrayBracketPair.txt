{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ArrayType.ArrayBracketPair",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3), 0 methods (nom=0), and 34 lines of code (loc=34). The lack of methods (wmc=0) and low field count indicate this is a simple data holder class with minimal complexity. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
