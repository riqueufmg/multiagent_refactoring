    "justification": "The class has only 8 methods (nom=8) and 48 lines of code (loc=48), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=8) indicates low complexity. With only 3 nested classes (nc=3) and no fields (nof=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
