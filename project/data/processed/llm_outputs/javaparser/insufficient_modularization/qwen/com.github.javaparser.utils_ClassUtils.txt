    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 2 fields (nof=2), with low complexity (wmc=3, loc=49). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure indicate proper modularization. The class is small and focused, not warranting further decomposition."
