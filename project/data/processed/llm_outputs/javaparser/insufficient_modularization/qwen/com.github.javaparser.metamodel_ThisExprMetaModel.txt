{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ThisExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 1 field (nof=1), and 9 lines of code (loc=9). The low number of methods and fields indicates proper modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the depth of inheritance tree (dit=3) is reasonable. The class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
