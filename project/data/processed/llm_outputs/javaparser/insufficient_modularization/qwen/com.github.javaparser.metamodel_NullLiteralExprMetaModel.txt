    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 0 fields (nof=0), 8 lines of code (loc=8), and a low weighted method count (wmc=1). The class appears to be a simple meta-model class with no signs of insufficient modularization as it is already highly decomposed and minimal in size and complexity."
