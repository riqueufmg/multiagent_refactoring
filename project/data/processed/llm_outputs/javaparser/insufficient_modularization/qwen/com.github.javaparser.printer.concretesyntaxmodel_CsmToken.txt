    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods with a WMC of 20, which indicates moderate complexity. The LOC is 63, which is relatively small. The class has a DIT of 1, indicating no inheritance hierarchy. While the class has multiple dependencies (6), this is not excessive for a class performing concrete syntax model token operations. The LCOM of 0.0 suggests good cohesion. The metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant further decomposition."
