{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.CoreGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (1 public), 48 lines of code, and WMC of 3. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the low number of dependencies (4) suggests reasonable modularization. The class size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
