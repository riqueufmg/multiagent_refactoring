    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithOptionalLabel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 15 lines of code (loc=15), which indicates a small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=5) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 class dependency (nc=1) and no inheritance (dit=0), this class appears to be well-modularized and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
