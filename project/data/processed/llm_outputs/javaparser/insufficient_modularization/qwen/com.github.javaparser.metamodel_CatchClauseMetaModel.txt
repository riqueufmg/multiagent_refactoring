    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.CatchClauseMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=10), few fields (NOF=2) and methods (NOM=1), and no class dependencies (NC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of fields and methods indicates proper decomposition, and the simple structure suggests adequate modularization."
