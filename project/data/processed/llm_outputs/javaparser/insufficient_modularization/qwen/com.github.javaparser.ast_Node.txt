```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Node",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (78 total, 65 public), a high WMC (150), and a large LOC (877), indicating high complexity and size. It also has a low LCOM value (0.141), which suggests that while the methods are cohesive, the class is still overly large and complex, indicating insufficient modularization. The high number of fields (26 total, 6 public) and dependencies (24) further support that this class could benefit from decomposition to reduce its size and complexity."
