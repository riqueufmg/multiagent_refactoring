```json
{
    "class": "foo.Foo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, wmc=2) and 8 lines of code (loc=8), which indicates a very small and simple class that does not require further decomposition. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests minimal complexity. The negative LCOM value (-1.0) may indicate either no fields or perfect cohesion, both consistent with a well-modularized small class."
