```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (177 total, 175 public), a high WMC (180), and a large LOC (536), indicating high complexity and insufficient decomposition. The LCOM value of 0.983 suggests poor cohesion, and the class directly depends on 47 other classes, which indicates it might be handling too much responsibility and could benefit from further modularization."
