    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.Log",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (106 LOC) and complexity (WMC=8) for its functionality. It has 7 methods with 6 being public, indicating a focused responsibility. The lack of inheritance (DIT=0) and low coupling (LCOM=0.0, no fan-in/fan-out) suggest proper modularization. While it has one dependency on its inner class Adapter, this is an appropriate design choice for logging functionality."
