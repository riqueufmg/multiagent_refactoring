    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedArrayType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) with all being public (nopm=12), indicating a well-defined interface. The WMC of 20 suggests moderate complexity but not excessive. LCOM of 0.25 indicates good cohesion within the class. With only 66 lines of code (loc=66) and 1 field (nof=1), the class is relatively small and focused. The lack of fanin and fanout dependencies (both 0) suggests it's not overly coupled. The DIT of 1 indicates it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy. These metrics suggest the class is appropriately modularized for its size and complexity."
