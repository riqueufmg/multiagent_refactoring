    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, wmc=3) and 31 lines of code (loc=31), which indicates a very small and simple class. With 4 nested classes (nc=4) but no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) or public methods (nopm=0), this appears to be a lightweight interface or abstract class that is already well-decomposed. The low complexity metrics suggest sufficient modularization has been achieved."
