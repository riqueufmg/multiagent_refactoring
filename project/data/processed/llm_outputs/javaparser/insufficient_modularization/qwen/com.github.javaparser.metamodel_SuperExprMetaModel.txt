    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.SuperExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), and a Weighted Method Count of 1 (wmc=1). The Lines of Code is minimal at 9 (loc=9) and it has no class dependencies (nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The low complexity metrics and minimal size indicate this class is already sufficiently modularized and does not require further decomposition."
