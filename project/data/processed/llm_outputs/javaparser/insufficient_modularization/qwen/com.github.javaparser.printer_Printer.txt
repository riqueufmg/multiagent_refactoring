    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.Printer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 6 lines of code (loc=6), and only 2 nested classes (nc=2). The low number of methods and small size indicate sufficient modularization. No public methods (nopm=0, nopf=0) suggests it may be a simple utility or configuration class rather than a complex class requiring further decomposition."
