    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.FieldAccessContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high WMC (20) relative to its number of methods (7), indicating complex method implementations. The LCOM value (0.857) is high, suggesting poor cohesion among methods and fields. With only 1 field and 7 methods, the class may be doing too much and could benefit from decomposition to improve modularity and reduce complexity."
