    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code, 0 methods, and 0 weighted method count. The lack of methods and low LOC indicate minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple interface or minimal abstract concept with no substantial functionality to decompose."
