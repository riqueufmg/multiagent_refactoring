    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.CompactConstructorDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC=59 (high cyclomatic complexity), NOM=29 (many methods), NOPM=28 (many public methods), and LOC=237 (large size). The class also has a DIT=4 indicating deep inheritance hierarchy. These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
