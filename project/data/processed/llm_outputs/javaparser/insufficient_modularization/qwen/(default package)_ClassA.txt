    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field, 1 public field, 0 methods, and 3 lines of code. The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies on other classes beyond ClassB. The class is already sufficiently decomposed given its minimal functionality."
