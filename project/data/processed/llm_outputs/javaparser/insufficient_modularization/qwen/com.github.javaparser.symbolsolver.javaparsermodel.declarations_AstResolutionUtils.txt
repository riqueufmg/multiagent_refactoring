    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.AstResolutionUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) value of 20 with only 5 methods, indicating complex method implementations. The LOC (Lines of Code) is 78 which is relatively high for a utility class with few methods, suggesting methods are likely complex and the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes or utility components."
