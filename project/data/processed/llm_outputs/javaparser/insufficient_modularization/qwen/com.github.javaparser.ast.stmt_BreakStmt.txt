    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.BreakStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 17 methods (nom=17, nopm=17) which is relatively high for a simple statement class, and WMC is 25 indicating moderate complexity. However, with only 95 lines of code (loc=95) and 17 methods, the average method size is reasonable. The class represents a simple BreakStmt node in AST which typically doesn't require further decomposition. LCOM value of 0.588 suggests reasonable cohesion, and the inheritance depth (dit=4) is moderate. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its purpose as a simple statement node."
