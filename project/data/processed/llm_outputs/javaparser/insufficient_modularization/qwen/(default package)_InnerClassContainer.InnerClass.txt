    "class": "(default package).InnerClassContainer.InnerClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 15 lines of code (loc=15). There are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance (dit=0). The class appears to be a simple, minimal inner class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it lacks the complexity that would require further decomposition."
