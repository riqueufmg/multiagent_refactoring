```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ImportDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 4 fields which are all property fields (nof=4, nopf=4), and minimal size (loc=12). The low WMC indicates simple method complexity, LCOM of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the small LOC count indicates the class is not overly large. There are no signs of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
