    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Node.ParentsVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 16 lines of code, 1 field, and 0 methods. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal complexity. While it could potentially be decomposed further, the extremely small size and low complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as the class is already highly cohesive and simple."
