    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.ImportOrderingStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3), 10 lines of code (loc=10), and 3 subclasses (nc=3). The Weighted Methods per Class is 3 (wmc=3) which is low. The class appears to be a simple strategy interface or enumeration with minimal complexity. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already appropriately small and simple."
