    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18, nopm=18) and 119 lines of code (loc=119) with a high weighted method count (wmc=32), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The class could benefit from decomposition to reduce implementation complexity and improve maintainability."
