    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19) and 38 lines of code (loc=38), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) equals 19, indicating moderate complexity. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no fields (nof=0), the class is relatively simple. The DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) is 1, indicating no inheritance complexity. While the class could potentially be decomposed, its size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization as it remains manageable and focused on its responsibilities."
