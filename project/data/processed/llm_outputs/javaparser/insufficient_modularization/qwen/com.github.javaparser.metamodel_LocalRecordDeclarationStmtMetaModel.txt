    "justification": "The class has very low complexity (WMC=1, DIT=3), minimal size (LOC=9), and only 1 method and 1 field. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already appropriately decomposed for its simple responsibility."
