    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.CastExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16, nopm=16) and 89 lines of code (loc=89), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=23) indicates reasonable complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and no static fields (nopf=0), the class maintains a focused responsibility. The lack of direct dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's not overly coupled. The LCOM value of 0.625 indicates some cohesion issues but is not severe enough to warrant decomposition. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality as a Cast expression node in an AST."
