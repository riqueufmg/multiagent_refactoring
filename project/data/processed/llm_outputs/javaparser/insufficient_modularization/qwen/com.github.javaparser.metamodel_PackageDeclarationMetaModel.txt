    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PackageDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 2 fields (nof=2), and 10 lines of code (loc=10). The low number of methods and fields, combined with minimal complexity, indicates that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class has no cyclic dependencies (lcom=0.0) and no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), suggesting proper separation of concerns."
