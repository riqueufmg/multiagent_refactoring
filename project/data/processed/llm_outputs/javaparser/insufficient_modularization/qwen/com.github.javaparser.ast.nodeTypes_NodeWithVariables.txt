    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithVariables",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 22 and 10 methods, while LOC is 99. The class has 4 nested classes (nc=4) and contains a Helper inner class, suggesting it could be further decomposed. The high WMC value indicates complex internal logic that could benefit from modularization into smaller, more focused classes."
