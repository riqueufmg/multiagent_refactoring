    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 18 lines of code (loc=18), with a low weighted method count (wmc=6). The class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it contains minimal functionality that would benefit from further decomposition."
