```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.DefaultPrettyPrinter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (47 LOC, 8 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=8). The LCOM value of 0.25 indicates good cohesion, and the DIT of 2 shows appropriate inheritance depth. The low number of fields (2) and methods (8) suggests the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
