    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.StringEscapeUtils.CharSequenceTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low lines of code (loc=68). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and fanin/fanout are both 0 showing no dependencies. This suggests the class is already well-decomposed or is a simple utility class that doesn't require further decomposition."
