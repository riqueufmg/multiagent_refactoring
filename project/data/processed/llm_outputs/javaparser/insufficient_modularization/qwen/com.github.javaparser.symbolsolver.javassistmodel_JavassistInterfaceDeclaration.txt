{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistInterfaceDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 methods (nom=28) with 26 of them being public (nopm=26), and a weighted method count of 42 (wmc=42), indicating high complexity. The lines of code at 141 (loc=141) suggest substantial implementation size. With 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 package private fields (nopf=0), the class appears to encapsulate significant functionality without clear separation of concerns. The high method count and complexity metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
