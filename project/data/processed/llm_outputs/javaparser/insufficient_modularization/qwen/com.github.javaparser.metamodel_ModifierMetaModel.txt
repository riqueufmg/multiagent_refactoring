    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), and a Weighted Method Count of 1 (wmc=1). The Lines of Code (loc=9) is minimal, indicating a small and simple class. The Lack of Cohesion (lcom=0.0) indicates high cohesion, and the Depth of Inheritance (dit=2) is moderate. With such low complexity and size, further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or implementation complexity."
