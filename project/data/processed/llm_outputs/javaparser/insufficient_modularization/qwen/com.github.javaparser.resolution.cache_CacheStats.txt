    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.cache.CacheStats",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 58 lines of code (loc=58), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The lack of fields (nof=0) and simple structure (wmc=14, dit=0) suggests it is already well-decomposed. The negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) indicates good cohesion, and zero fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggest it's properly isolated. No further decomposition is warranted based on the provided metrics."
