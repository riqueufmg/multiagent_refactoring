    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavadocCommentMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 2 fields (nof=0, nc=2), with a very low weighted method count (wmc=2) and only 11 lines of code (loc=11). The depth of inheritance tree is 3 (dit=3) which is moderate. With such minimal complexity and size, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently decomposed."
