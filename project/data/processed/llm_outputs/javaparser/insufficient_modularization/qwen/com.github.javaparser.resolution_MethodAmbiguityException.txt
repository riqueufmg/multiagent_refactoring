    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.MethodAmbiguityException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=12), and low weighted method count (wmc=1). The class appears to be a simple exception class with no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies, indicating it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
