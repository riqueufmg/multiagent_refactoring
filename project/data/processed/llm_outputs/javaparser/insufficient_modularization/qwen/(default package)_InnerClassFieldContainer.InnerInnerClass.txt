    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, 6 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The metrics indicate a very simple class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of complex functionality that would benefit from further decomposition."
