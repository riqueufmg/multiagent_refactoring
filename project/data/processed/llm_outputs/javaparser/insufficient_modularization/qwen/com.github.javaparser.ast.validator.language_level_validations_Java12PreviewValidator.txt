    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java12PreviewValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 13 lines of code (loc=13), which indicates minimal complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=1) is low, suggesting simple implementation. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) indicates a focused, simple class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
