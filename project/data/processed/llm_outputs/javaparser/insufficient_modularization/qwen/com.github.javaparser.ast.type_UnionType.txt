    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.UnionType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19, nopm=19) and 95 lines of code (loc=95), with a weighted method count of 27 (wmc=27). The high number of methods and complexity indicators suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The class also has a moderate LCOM value of 0.63, indicating some cohesion issues that could be improved through better modularization."
