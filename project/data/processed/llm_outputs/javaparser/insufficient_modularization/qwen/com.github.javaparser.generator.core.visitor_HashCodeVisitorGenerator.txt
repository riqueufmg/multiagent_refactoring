    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.HashCodeVisitorGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 1 private method (nopm=1), 44 lines of code (loc=44), and a relatively low weighted method count (wmc=8). The class has no fields (nof=0) and no public fields (nopf=0). With only 2 methods and moderate complexity, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be properly decomposed for its functionality."
