    "justification": "The class has 6 fields and 9 methods with a WMC of 10, indicating moderate complexity. The LOC is 69 which is relatively small. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, the metrics do not indicate sufficient complexity or size to warrant decomposition. The class appears to have a single responsibility focused on indentation configuration."
