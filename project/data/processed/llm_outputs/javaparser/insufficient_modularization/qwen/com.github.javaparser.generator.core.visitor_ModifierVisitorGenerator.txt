    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.ModifierVisitorGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 1 public method (nopm=1), and manageable size of 56 lines of code (loc=56). The weighted method count (wmc=12) indicates moderate complexity. With only 2 levels of inheritance depth (dit=2) and no class dependencies (nof=0, nopf=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), the class appears to be sufficiently modularized for its current scope and responsibilities."
