    "justification": "The class has very low complexity metrics (loc=5, wmc=0, nof=0, nom=0) and no dependencies, indicating it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple, focused implementation with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
