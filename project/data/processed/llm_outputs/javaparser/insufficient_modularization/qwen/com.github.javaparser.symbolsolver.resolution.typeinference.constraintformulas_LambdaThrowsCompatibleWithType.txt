{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.constraintformulas.LambdaThrowsCompatibleWithType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 7 weighted method count (wmc=7), and 26 lines of code (loc=26). The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1) indicate it is already well modularized. The low LCOM value (0.5) suggests good cohesion among methods."
