    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), 3 lines of code (loc=3), and a Weighted Method Count of 1 (wmc=1). The low number of methods and minimal code size indicate that further decomposition would not provide meaningful benefits for reducing size or complexity."
