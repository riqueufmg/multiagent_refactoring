    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) value of 38, indicating high complexity. It also has 6 methods with only 2 fields, suggesting potential for better decomposition. The LOC (Lines of Code) is 161 which is relatively high for a single class, supporting insufficient modularization."
