    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils.JavassistModuleHelper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 38 lines of code (loc=38), and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=1) and methods (nopm=1) indicates minimal functionality. With such a simple structure and low complexity metrics, there is no indication that further decomposition would provide benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
