    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.PrimitiveType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 methods (nom=28, nopm=28) and 137 lines of code (loc=137), indicating high implementation complexity. The WMC metric of 29 suggests high cyclomatic complexity. The class directly manages primitive type representations and has multiple dependencies including resolution types, visitors, and meta-model classes, suggesting it could be further decomposed to separate concerns like type handling, resolution, and visitor patterns."
