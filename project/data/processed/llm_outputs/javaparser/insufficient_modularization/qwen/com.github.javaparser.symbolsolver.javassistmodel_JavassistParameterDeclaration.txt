    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (42 LOC) and complexity (WMC=10, NOM=10) for a parameter declaration class. All methods are public (NOPM=NOM=10) suggesting cohesive interface exposure. The low LCOM value (0.4) indicates good cohesion among methods. The class has minimal external dependencies (3) and no fan-in/fan-out, suggesting focused responsibility. No indication of incomplete decomposition or excessive complexity requiring further modularization."
