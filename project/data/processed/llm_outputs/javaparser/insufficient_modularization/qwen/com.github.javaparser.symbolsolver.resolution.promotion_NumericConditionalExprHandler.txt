    "justification": "The class has reasonable size (58 LOC, 6 methods) and complexity (WMC=15), with proper decomposition shown by low LCOM value (0.5). The class has only 4 fields and 2 private methods, indicating appropriate internal structure. No excessive complexity or size indicators present that would warrant further decomposition."
