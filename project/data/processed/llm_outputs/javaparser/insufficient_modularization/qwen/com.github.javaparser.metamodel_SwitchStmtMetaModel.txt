    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.SwitchStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 2 fields (nof=2), and a low weighted method count (wmc=1). The lines of code (loc=10) indicate a very small class. With only 2 properties and no complex dependencies beyond a single meta-model dependency, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
