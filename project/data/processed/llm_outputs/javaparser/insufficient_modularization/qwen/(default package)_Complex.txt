    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) and 21 lines of code (loc=21), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=5) indicates low complexity. With only 2 fields (nof=2) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.4), the class does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
