{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavaToken",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 methods (nom) with 404 lines of code (loc), resulting in a high complexity for a single class. The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) is 40, which is high. The class has 7 fields (nof) and 1 public field (nopf), along with 25 public methods (nopm), indicating a large public interface. The high number of methods and lines of code suggest the class could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. The class also has multiple dependencies (7 external classes) which further indicates it might be doing too much and could be broken down into smaller, more focused components."
