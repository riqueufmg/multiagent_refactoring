    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.quality.NotNullGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with a weighted method count of 18 (wmc=18), indicating high complexity. It has 93 lines of code (loc=93) and depends on 10 external classes, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The class has 2 public methods (nopm=2) but 8 total methods, indicating internal complexity that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The depth of inheritance tree is 2 (dit=2), showing it's part of a hierarchy but still exhibits high internal complexity that warrants further modularization."
