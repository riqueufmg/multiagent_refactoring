    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.EnumDeclarationContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5 total, 4 public), low lines of code (31), low weighted method count (9), and low complexity metrics. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion. The class appears to be well-focused with a single responsibility related to enum declaration context handling, and there is no evidence of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
