    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Kept",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) with 15 being public (nopm=15), and a relatively low WMC of 23 indicating simple method complexity. The LOC is 74 which is moderate, and LCOM of 0.25 suggests good cohesion. The class has only 1 field (nof=1) and no package or class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating it's already well-decomposed with focused responsibilities."
