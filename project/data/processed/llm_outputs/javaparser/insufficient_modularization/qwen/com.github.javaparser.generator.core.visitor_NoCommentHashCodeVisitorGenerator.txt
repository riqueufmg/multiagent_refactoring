    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.NoCommentHashCodeVisitorGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with low complexity (wmc=10), minimal lines of code (loc=48), no fields (nof=0), and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of methods and manageable complexity metrics indicate sufficient modularization without need for further decomposition."
