    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.AssertStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=10), few fields (NOF=2) and methods (NOM=1), and no class dependencies (NC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of fields and methods indicates proper modularization without excessive size or complexity that would require further decomposition."
