    "class": "foo.bar.BinaryExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and no dependencies. The metrics indicate a minimal class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it has not grown beyond a reasonable size or complexity threshold."
